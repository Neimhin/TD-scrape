On my second-last day in the Dáil, I would like to make a small contribution to the debate on the Finance Bill 2011.  This is the most unusual week I have experienced in the Oireachtas.  We are discussing a finance Bill at a time when the sword of a general election is hanging over those who are contesting the election and those who are not for various reasons.  It is a most unusual situation.  My party's finance spokesman has outlined Fine Gael's reservations about this legislation.  While we are determined to meet the objectives that have been agreed with the IMF and the EU, we would go about it in a different way from the Government.  Therefore, we will oppose certain sections of the Bill.Fine Gael plans to make the necessary budget correction through a combination of capital savings and incentives.  We will make greater savings through reductions in expenditure than through tax increases.  Every budget adjustment should be scrutinised from a political and an economic point of view.  That is how Fine Gael has arrived at its current position.  The only reason we are debating this Bill is that there has been such internal combustion in the Government parties.  If that had not happened, we would not have had this opportunity.  It is most unusual that we are dealing with this matter in advance of the election that is likely to be held on 25 February.  We are in a vacuum while we are waiting for it to take place.  The sooner it happens, the better.I thank my colleagues for giving me an opportunity to make a final contribution to this Dáil.  Perhaps I will have second thoughts.  I hardly will.

I enjoyed that time, just as I enjoyed all 22 years I spent in the Dáil and the two and a half years I spent in the Seanad before that.  I have made great friends here.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his predecessors for the courtesy they have extended to me.  Most of my colleagues who are retiring have told me they felt a great sense of relief after they made that decision.  My circumstances are slightly different because I am not a voluntary retiree.  I have not experienced that sense of relief.  I have a sense of sadness as I leave the Dáil.  That is the way politics is.I have tried to make a contribution over the years I have spent in this House.  I hope I did not insult too many people.  The current Taoiseach and perhaps some of his predecessors often had to answer me back in the Dáil.  If I said anything to upset them, I apologise for that.  That was my style.  People cannot change their style.  I was true to what I felt as a representative.  I hope I have been of some use to the people of Galway West.  My constituents stood by me by returning me at the last five general elections.  I was first elected in 1989.  I leave this House with the privilege of never having failed to be elected to any body to which I stood for election.  I am proud of my political contribution to this Dáil and the people of Galway West.  I thank my constituents for giving me the great privilege of representing them in the Dáil over the past 22 years.  The team we have selected in Galway West will certainly bring back two seats and has a great chance of three seats.  It will take three people to replace me anyway.

#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Táim buíoch as ucht an deis seo labhairt ar an mBille tábhachtach seo.  I welcome the opportunity to speak during this important debate.  I welcome the Minister's changes to the universal service charge for medical card holders.  It was not just the Independent Deputies who had representations; we all had them.  I acknowledge that the Minister has dealt with this in a satisfactory manner.I will make a brief reference to section 23 properties.  Deputies will have received many representations from ordinary people on this matter, and I believe a review is necessary.  There are those who say the section 23 provisions were for big builders and developers, and there were certainly some of those, but I have been contacted by quite a number of ordinary people who invested in such properties, including schoolteachers, doctors, gardaí and nurses.  They saw it as a means of providing a pension for themselves later in life.I would have liked the Minister to deal with approved retirement funds, ARFs.  From this year the assumed annual drawdown on which people will be liable for tax is 5%, rather than 3% as it was previously.  Given the low level of investment returns at the moment, many people have contacted me to suggest that a drawdown of 5% per year will effectively deplete their funds in slightly over 20 years.  I do not think it is in the national interest that people who have provided for their own private pensions will effectively become dependent on the State after 20 years.  I would like to see a review of that.I wish Deputy McCormack and all Deputies who are retiring well.  I hope they will have the opportunity to say a few words in this Chamber before they retire, but much will depend on the actions of the Opposition.  The last week has not been a good one for politics.  We hear a lot of talk about Oireachtas reform, and I agree with that, but the first reform I would like to see is a bit of honesty in the House and less play-acting.  Everybody outside the House agrees that the passing of the budget is necessary not just because they believe the State should provide for its finances but, more importantly, because our friends in Europe and the IMF have told us we need to bring in a budget and implement the four year recovery plan which has been agreed with them.  They certainly want us, as a Parliament, to institute that.It is inevitable, and it is accepted on all sides of the House, that there will be a change of Government and that Fine Gael and the Labour Party will form the next Government.  The onus is on them today to make sure the budget is passed.  I do not think it is reasonable that three Independents should be the fall guys if this budget fails.  The leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, who will possibly be the new Taoiseach, is here today.  I am saying to him that if the Opposition Deputies want to have any credibility and if they have any respect for the people of Ireland, they will make sure the budget is passed today.  It is ridiculous for them to say "Yes, of course it should be passed", and then not make sure it is passed.  I suggest that the only reason they want the Fianna Fáil minority Government to pass it is that they can go out on the streets and blame Fianna Fáil for the budget provisions.  Deputy Kenny would then be able to come back in a month's time as Taoiseach, say that Fine Gael is not to blame for the budget provisions as it was not in government at the time, and then bring in supplementary budgets.  It is ridiculous to talk for years about guillotining debates and then write out of the script issues such as bankers' bonuses, which everybody in this Chamber has talked about, because we have a deadline to complete our business by Friday.  That is dishonest.  I am asking Deputy Kenny, the probable future Taoiseach——

I want, first, to pay tribute to all the good people in the House before the Ceann Comhairle cuts me short, as I might have too much to say.  I worked under four leaders including Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey, the brightest and best.  I was at Leopardstown races some weeks ago and there was a poster saying, "Bring back Haughey, clean up the mess".  I served under taoisigh Albert Reynolds, Bertie Ahern and now Brian Cowen and I enjoyed every day of my time here.I did not get high office because I did not behave myself, which is a tragic situation.  Blind loyalty is ruining every party and organisation in the country.  I want to pay tribute to all my good friends on the Opposition side, even Sinn Féin.  Deputy Arthur Morgan served with me on the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and we got on well.  His contributions were always worth listening to.  I had good friends in the Labour Party as well.As regards Fine Gael, it is interesting to reflect that on the day I lost my job as Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture I met Deputy Enda Kenny coming out the door of Leinster House as I was coming in.  He had lost a job on the Front Bench under Deputy Michael Noonan who had taken over as leader of Fine Gael.  Deputy Kenny said: "We've no more business here.  Come on away with me."  He came back and is bound for greener pastures and I am going back to the hills and valleys of north Cork.  I want to congratulate him on his efforts on behalf of Fine Gael.  He has done wonderful things for Fine Gael since he was made leader.  He has often been under pressure, and wrongly I would say.  To our embarrassment and disadvantage he has done well for Fine Gael.  I am confident that he will be Taoiseach, so I wish him well, and regret I will not be here to question him from the Opposition side, because I always loved being in opposition.  I want to say "well done" to him and an overall majority might be within his grasp.

If something happened on a Monday, it would appear in print the following day, so that Tuesday's newspaper mattered, not Monday's.  After a few arguments about this I decided to accept the status quo , not try to correct matters and move on.  I always got on well with the staff of the House as well, and got to know them all on a personal basis.  I say “well done” to the Captain, the head usher and the Clerk of the Dáil.  They have run a very efficient and orderly operation here, and that is very important.  These are my parting thoughts to the House in my last few minutes here.  As I have said, I am going back to the green fields and the golden vale of north Cork, having served under four leaders.I have two e-mails to read out to the House before I conclude.  These are very important and I want to put them on the record.  The first, dated 24 January 2011, is from Mr. John Rafter, general secretary Garda Síochána Retired Members Association, and it states:Please find attached copy of letter from the Garda Síochána Retired Members Association to Mr. Brian Lenihan, TD., Minister for Finance outlining the dissatisfaction of our association (with) the cuts to Garda pensions as a result of the changes made in Budget 2010.I would ask for your support in having the measures contained in Budget 2010 rescinded when the Finance Bill is before the Houses of the Oireachtas.The next one, dated 21 January 2011, is from Mr. Jim Groarke, and reads:Can you explain to me what the universal social charge is, why it was introduced and where the money goes?  Also, if you or your party form part or all of the next government, will you work towards removing this charge?I will not be here, anyway.  I wanted to put those on the record, and I have a bundle of e-mails.  The country is in very serious crisis.  We will finish up with no private banks in the high street and I beg the incoming Government to sort out the banking crisis and arrange for us to have a private banking system again.  We trade internationally and as a trading country we will be very suspect if all our banks are State-owned.  I hear the threat this morning as regards Bank of Ireland coming under State ownership as well.  That to me does not augur well.We had the regulators, Pat Neary and John Hurley.  I worked as a member of the finance committee and ultimately they did not have the legislation and wherewithal their office required.  Now we have a system of regulation, while there is no money available in the street.  We need to put the Finance Bill through because there is no money available to extend credit to businesses as working capital over a short period of time, because of over-regulation.  We cannot just go from having no regulation into a regime of high regulation.  I beg whoever is in government to immediately sort this out.  I have no confidence in either Professor Patrick Honohan or Mr. Matthew Elderfield.Mr. Elderfield is here to chastise us, I suspect, and he has brought a team with him.  That I resent very much and he probably believes the Irish are what Cromwell thought of us in the 1600s, and I say the same thing to him.  Professor Honohan has said he would sell our banks.  I do not think he can sell any bank.  He made a point to the effect that the Chinese might buy them.  I do not want to see the Chinese with a financial base in Ireland, neither do I want them to have a military base here — because that is the one they are really interested in — from which to take over the world.  Ireland would be the ideal place for such a base, in the Atlantic.  Let us recognise that such threats are very real.  Such things have happened before and history can repeat itself.  With that mentality one gets nowhere.Today Allied Irish Banks goes on the ESM, and that to me is a real tragedy.  We should manage our banks differently.  We have too many theoretical economists telling us what to do and they cannot manage their own business, never mind mine and the banking business.  I very much regret what has happened to our banking system.  I come from the southern part of the country, like Deputy Michael Noonan, the Fine Gael spokesman on finance.  The Munster and Leinster, in the old days, was the bank that kept the farming community in business.  It gave extended credit in the valley periods and this worked very well for farmers.  Sometimes farming is in great difficulty.  The bank helped to develop our co-operative movement, which has been the driver of jobs in rural towns and villages in County Cork, as well as in Limerick, and indeed all of Munster, including parts of Kilkenny.  That was the bank which served the rural community.  It was generous and ran a good business.I understand that Deputy Morgan's leader has suggested the two banks should be merged.  What a foolish thing to do — the stupid ass.  I suggest that each of the two main banks demerge and that we return to the Provincial Bank, the Royal Bank and the Munster and Leinster Bank once more.  On the Bank of Ireland side we should return to the Hibernian Bank and the National Bank.  It was the order of the day for them to merge, some 25 years ago or more, but it is different today, and we need much smaller banks.  That is the way forward for the banks.  I was in town last night, when I saw a pub that was formerly the Hibernian Bank, owned by Bank of Ireland and I thought it would be lovely if that was reopened as a bank, since the licensed premises was to close.  Let us de merge the banks.  It can be done, and it has been, before.  I would urge the next Minister for Finance to consider this urgently.  I appeal for a renewal of the banking system because there is no confidence left in that regard.  The system is practically closing down because of the shortage of credit and the lack of overdraft facilities to deal with valley periods.  Any Deputy in this House who is not aware of this situation is asleep, like Rip Van Winkle, because there is a crisis.We previously had State-owned banks with the one policy of Government.  We have had ACC and ICC and know how they worked.  We have a few foreign banks and they are getting out as fast as they can.  I want to see business people in charge of the banking system, people such as Denis O'Brien, Dermot Desmond or Martin Naughton of Glen Dimplex etc.  There are about five such people who could do what is needed.  We neither want regulators nor economists such as Peter Bacon who put us where we are, with NAMA and all those things.It is interesting to hear the debate on the Finance Bill and what is being said in the national interest.  Fine Gael and Labour want to uphold the national interest while at the same time wanting to vote down sections of the Bill.  If I was thinking of the national interest, I would not vote against it, but rather let it through.  It is in the Opposition's interest to let it through because the Government side is doing the dirty work for Fine Gael and Labour.  I read out those two e-mails for that reason.  Then we have the three musketeers, Deputies Jackie Healy-Rae, Michael Lowry and Mattie McGrath, whom I thank for coming in to listen to me.  However, I think he should go to Dunnes Stores to get better value.

This Government has been a victim of those Independents who try to tell us what to do.  I never want to see that again.  I never want to see this Government or any Government held to ransom by people like that for petty matters like footpaths, schools and bits of roads.

#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I picked up an article over the weekend that caught my attention.  The headline is "Hundreds of poor Irish buried in mass graves in UK each year".  The article concerns hundreds of impoverished Irish people, with no known family, who are buried in unmarked mass graves in London by the local councils.  In the case of Southwark Council, half of the 50 people whose funerals are organised and funded by the borough are elderly Irish men.  Each borough has slightly different procedures but the majority of those buried in paupers' graves are laid to rest without anything to identify them and in graves with the remains of up to 25 other people.  That is shocking.I emigrated in 1986 and I witnessed the lives and hardship of people who, in many cases, have not returned to Ireland.  It is important to accept in this Chamber the net effect of what has happened to our economy for many of the people who will not be returning.  Some may think this is a slightly dramatic way of portraying the issue.  Some people go abroad, they thrive, they learn new skills and they meet interesting people but many people do not do so well.  One of my most vivid memories is being in the Rye River pub, off Jerome Avenue in the Bronx in 1987.  It was 40°C outside and a line of middle-aged men were reading newspapers three days old and drinking pints of Guinness.  Many told me they had not been back to Ireland in 20 years.Yesterday, I canvassed a rural part of Waterford, Stradbally, and it was the issue on everyone's tongue.  They all talked about emigration, their children leaving and the safeguarding of small businesses.  In this Finance Bill, self-employed people are hit again.  They will pay an additional 3% surcharge on income over €100,000.  I want to address the treatment of self-employed people.  I have just received the back to education allowance figures for Waterford.  In 2005 to 2006 there were 275 participants.  In 2009 to 2010, there were 902 participants.  How many of those are self-employed people?  Not as many as there should be.  If a self-employed person loses his or her job, he or she can apply for jobseeker's allowance, which is means tested.  However, if the spouse earns more than €400 per week, he or she does not qualify for the back to education allowance, work placements, retraining schemes or the back to work allowance.  These people are leaving the system completely.  They have become statistics and are completely disenfranchised.  They are the ones emigrating.If the percentage contribution for self-employed people is to be raised, at the very least they should be entitled to the basic facets of State retraining.  They are the entrepreneurs and self-starters, the ones who have created jobs in this country.  In many cases, they have never asked the State for assistance.  If the rate of contribution increases for the self-employed, we must ensure these skilled entrepreneurs can get adequate retraining.  As a State, we need to examine the question of self-employed workers generally.Many of these Irish men and women will not come back to Ireland unless we recognise their value, their skills and, most importantly, their needs.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution.  There are many areas I would like to touch on but the brief time available means I must highlight the failure of the Government in respect of, and the need for a new Government to respond to, those suffering from mental illness, stress-related illnesses and those who are suicidal.  We must recognise the serious suicide situation resulting from the recession.  We have seen this exposed by the media in the past number of days.  The reduction in the mental health services budget from 8% to 3.5% of the total health budget is a disgrace.  It marginalises those with mental health difficulties and does not give them an opportunity to recover.The treatment of mental health problems must become recovery orientated.  We can compare England's 12% and Scotland's 18% of the total health budget to our figure of 3.5%.  We have failed to introduce the Government's policy and the recommendations of the A Vision for Change report.  The key aspect of that was to introduce multidisciplinary, community-based psychiatric services so that we deal with people in the community.  All disciplines should be available and the team can decide the best type of treatment for the person at an early stage.People ask where we will get the money for this.  My reply is that because of the lack of community-based psychiatric services, people are in psychiatric hospitals who would not be there if they were treated in the community at an early stage.  If that policy was introduced, we could reduce the number of psychiatric hospital beds by 500.  The Ceann Comhairle can make the calculations, when it costs €1,000 a day for a psychiatric patient in hospital.  Private hospitals charge approximately €500, which is paid by the VHI.  We can save up to €200 million if we change the system, based on the €1,000 per day figure.  We also have geriatrics, elderly, long-term patients who do not need psychiatric treatment and who need nursing home treatment.We should bear in mind that it costs €7,000 a week for a patient to be cared for in a psychiatric hospital and if such a patient were moved to a nursing home, it would cost €1,000 a week to care for him or her.  The system itself can produce the finances to introduce proper community-based psychiatric beds.It is disheartening to read the report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services.  As the report states:[The inspector has constantly identified year after year] an unaccountable failure to implement policy which is 20 years old and, as a result, prevailing conditions in Ireland's mental health services remain a scandal.  The inability to change policy in the past unfortunately raises concerns about the implementation of the new ‘Vision for Change' policy [which I recommended] unless the Government approaches the issues with a real will to change along with the absolutely necessary recourses [ as I have pointed out].  There is no doubt that the neglect of the psychiatric services over the last 10 years has, at its root, the decision by the Government to slash . . . . the Health Budget [for psychiatric services, which is totally unacceptable].We hope that Fine Gael will have an opportunity in government to examine this.  It will take time but it should be examined.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	116	In the current economic climate it is important that all legislation that has come before the House now and that will come before it during the lifetime of the next Dáil is judged on the basis of two criteria — first, does it address the gaping hole in our public finances and, second, does it assist in some way in endeavouring to stimulate growth, create jobs and get people back to work?  On the basis of the first criterion on addressing the public finances, I welcome the Finance Bill.  It is well documented that the Fine Gael Party has committed and signed up to the target of a €6 billion adjustment over the period of four years in accordance with the four-year plan.  However, I and my party disagree with some of the mechanisms employed in some of the provisions of the Bill, which set out to achieve this target.The universal social charge has been much talked about in the media in recent weeks and it is being raised on the doorsteps, with people having received their pay cheques in the past week or two.  The universal social charge is a very significant issue.  I welcome the concept of a universal social charge in the sense it tidies up the various levies which were introduced in the previous two budgets.  That is important as it adds clarity and streamlines the taxation system, to some extent, and this is necessary.  However, I do not believe that the blunt instrument which has been used to introduce and implement it is correct.  I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on foot of lobbying by certain Independents, who no doubt will happily take credit for it, has made some changes in regard to medical card holders.  This goes some way towards addressing some of the problems with the charge.  However, it needs to be acknowledged, as referred to by Deputy Deasy, that the trade off is that the self-employed will be further penalised under the Finance Bill and that is an extremely regrettable prospect.  Self-employed people will now reach a marginal rate of tax, that of 55% at a minimum.  These are by and large significant contributors to the Exchequer through a variety of means of taxation, through their businesses as well their personal income tax.Under the second criterion on which legislation should be judged, that of whether it assists growth and job stimulation, it is clear that this Bill, as with all the former legislation which has come from this Government, is basically lacking.  What we have seen time and again is the complete dearth of ideas, of imagination and of a drive behind the Government and the Cabinet to start injecting a stimulus to our economy and start prioritising job creation.  I look forward to the creation of a new Government under the mandate of the next Dáil.  It is vital that we see new young, vibrant, energetic Ministers with new ideas and new concepts who will bring a new energy to Departments to drive forward our economy because it is clear that this tired Government has entirely run out of ideas.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding service given to Fine Gael by Deputy Pádraic McCormack, chairman of our parliamentary party.  I wish him and his wife, Eilish, the very best.I also pay tribute to the work of Deputy Jimmy Devins, my colleague from Sligo-North Leitrim.  I have worked very closely and effectively with him since he was elected to this House in 2002.  I found him at all times to be a man of immense integrity, having had the concerns of the electorate close to his heart.  Despite his best attempts, he was very much let down by the Government when it came to the retention of critical services, those of cancer services, at Sligo General Hospital.  I wish him and his wife, Mary, and family the best of good health and good luck.  It was always a great pleasure to meet him and work with him as part of a team working for the people of Sligo-North Leitrim.Turning to the Finance Bill, it has failed small companies in many ways.  There are 86,000 small companies in Ireland, employing more than 700,000 people and generating €80 billion in turnover annually.  They contribute to the economy in that they account for 37% of income tax receipts and 50% of VAT receipts.At a personal level, these hard-working individuals play a central role in their local communities.  They take risks, create jobs and generate enterprise.  Fine Gael in government will encourage entrepreneurs to explore new business ideas, to invest and to take risks.  The Government has a vital role to play in supporting new businesses and encouraging entrepreneurs to invest in and grow existing businesses, and Fine Gael in government will do that.  The Government's record in this area is a disgrace.  It has put billions into banks and nothing into enterprise.Small and medium-sized enterprises represent 95% of all businesses.  Of a total of more than 80,000 small businesses, 11,000 employ up to 50 staff.  They incorporate the following critical sectors — accommodation and food, financial, insurance, real estate, information and communications technology, film and digital media, health care, agriculture, construction, utilities, wholesale and retail, administration and support services, and professional, scientific and technical services.Fine Gael in government will understand the need to create an environment beneficial to the establishment of the growth of small companies and in government it will create this environment.  Most important, Fine Gael will have concern for and will respect the role of entrepreneurs and small businesses.  Many problems face small businesses, including undercapitalisation, weak financial structures, lack of funding from banks, difficulty in securing funding, lack of Government support and a high level of bureaucracy and red tape.When one notes the stimulus that has been given to and the investment that has been made in the banks, nothing has been given to those business people who are the backbone of this economy.  I have no doubt this economy will recover, but to kick start this economy, we need to support small companies in the retention and the creation of jobs.  Rather than have 50,000 people leave this country, we should be working with bright young people with business ideas and investing in and supporting their proposals.  Instead of investing money in property, Fine Gael will invest in people.  It will invest in ideas, encourage people to stay in Ireland and invest in research and development in which there has been little or no investment.  We will reduce the level of red tape.  I heard these issues discussed on an RTE Radio 1 programme this morning and the business spokesperson on that programme said that 400 businesses will close this month.   That is outrageous and it will have an adverse impact.Speaking for my last time in this Parliament, I very much look forward to receiving the support of the electorate in Sligo-North Leitrim so that I will be re-elected with a strong mandate for the region.  I wish well to everybody who has decided to retire.  I have made many friends here and they are from every political party. I wish them well and continued health and good luck.  I do not regard leaving political life as retirement but as a change of lifestyle.  I hope those who make the change will enjoy it.

I wish him well in the new Dáil.For over a decade, the Government, in various shades, spent the public's money in a wanton fashion.  It never consulted or sought the advice of this side of the House.  It never took on board the very many positive measures put forward by this side of the House.  Now in the Government's hour of need, it seeks our help for the good of the State.  This is a Pauline conversion on its deathbed.Fine Gael believes the fiscal adjustment should be achieved through expenditure savings as opposed to tax increases.  There is great scope for savings in the public service.  People talk about fixing the political system.  While there are steps to be taken in respect of the political system, its main fault is the practitioners therein.  The system has worked in the past and can work in the future.  We could spend another decade navel-gazing and return with the same system.  The biggest weakness of this House is the failure to recognise the implications of measures we take on business and the business environment.Whatever Government is formed in the next few weeks will have to introduce a new finance Bill with measures to facilitate growth and the creation of jobs.  To date, there have been cutbacks.  We must address bureaucracy in the form of the Health and Safety Authority, NERA and all the bodies set up during the Celtic tiger years.There are measures we can take outside our economic remit that will have implications.  Over the years during which I have been a Member, I have been harping on about the issue of early intervention in education.  Our education system is going down the Swanee because of the failure in respect of numeracy and literacy in the primary curriculum.  A report published in recent weeks identifies this problem.  People ask me how this has happened and state we need another report to establish the facts.  It happened because we have a curriculum that does not facilitate development.It is essential that the new Government introduce a finance Bill that will create hope, a stimulus and jobs.  The difficulty in Britain in recent days will have an impact on our exports.  Interest rates will probably increase in the coming year or so, thus affecting mortgage holders.  There are many negatives on the horizon and this is why we need to instil confidence.  Let us renegotiate and conclude the interest rate deal with the IMF as soon as we can in order to run our own affairs.I pay tribute to all those who are retiring.  I am sorry I was not present for the speech of Deputy Edward O'Keeffe, who is a very outspoken man.  I wish him, his colleagues, my colleagues on this side of the House and others well in the weeks ahead.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I compliment Deputy Edward O'Keeffe, who is from a neighbouring constituency, and all Members who are taking the opportunity to retire.  I thank them for their public service.The legislation being discussed is most important.  I believe from the bottom of my heart that it is being rushed through the Houses with indecent haste.  I have sat through so many debates in recent months and years in which the Opposition frequently criticised the Government for the use of the guillotine, thereby rushing legislation.  Now that the prize is in sight, there is no time for due diligence and proper debate.Leaders of the Opposition and others have been publicising with great gusto the view that they are the custodians of the national interest.  Only now, when this coincides with their own interests, are they throwing caution to the wind.The Green Party was a partner in Government.  It destabilised the Government in a major way in November, at which time it wanted to be in and out of Government.  It is now appealing to the Opposition to carry the Bill.  It has great responsibility and is answerable to the public for its actions.I welcome the effective deferral into next year of the curtailment of the tax reliefs on section 33 properties.  There is now a tendency to consider property as a dirty word.  Anyone who speculated on or invested in property is now regarded as a rogue or crony.  The reality is that section 33 provisions were availed of increasingly by some very ordinary people.  The provisions were promoted by the Government and people were advised by solicitors and accountants that the section 33 scheme was wonderful.  It was regarded as one of the safest schemes one could opt for because it was State backed and one entered into a contract with the State.In many cases, people leveraged their own properties, affecting their future and that of their children, to engage in small-scale property investment.  They rejuvenated many derelict areas in small towns in the process.  They were not major developers.  They were ordinary people in ordinary positions.  They included self-employed people, teachers, doctors and others who are valued in the community.  They are not connected in any way to the property moguls or the high-level speculators involved with NAMA or who engaged in reckless borrowing and lending, from Anglo Irish Bank and other banks.These small-time investors entered into a contract and were advised by legal and financial experts to do so.  They paid dearly for that advice.  The section 33 scheme was regarded as guaranteed.  When we enter into contracts by mutual agreement, that is fine; when one enters into a contract with the State, one believes the contract will be honoured by it.  People who now wish to revisit their contract with the State are not allowed to do so.  Some have taken the tax reliefs but many have not.What is occurring is unconstitutional and it will be proven to be such.  I welcome the 12-month deferral and acknowledge the serious effect the removal of the scheme will have on the trust of the people.  The trust of the people has been shattered in so many ways.  The people in question were willing to make an investment, enter into a contract, put their money where their mouths were to better their communities, and build for themselves and their families without trying to get rich quickly.  Their plight is sad.  The section 33 scheme is to be abolished in the interest of resolving the national crisis brought about by the banks and light-touch regulation, as a consequence of which nobody in the Government shouted "Stop".I am appalled that no banker has been brought to justice to date.  Everybody is innocent until proven guilty and I respect due process, which must never be questioned.  I was surprised and heartened last year when the then Garda Commissioner stated he expected people to be brought before the courts before the end of the year.  He has now retired and I wish him well.  We are now one month into the new year and there is no sign of anyone being charged.  That those responsible have not been brought to book constitutes an appalling vista for the Government, bearing in mind that we cannot interfere with investigations.As a small businessman, I know the legalities involved.  When one does one's accounts every year, one's accountant or auditor signs off on them based on the information supplied.  Huge tranches of money were moved out of banks into other banks and this was basic, naked, unadulterated fraud.  There is to be a huge, lengthy trawl to ensure everything is right but that is only a cop-out and excuse.  People are hiding behind this trawl.  They need to be charged for their wrongdoing in the courts and must pay the price.Budget after budget, it was promised that so many quangos would be disbanded.  They are a drain on the resources of the country and comprise a wasteful exercise.  We have handed over power from this Parliament, to which I and every other Member was elected.  I wish every candidate well in the forthcoming election.  I hope the next Government will be able to sort out the issues that the people want addressed.With regard to the property market, rent dried up for investors.  There are human tragedies involved.  Families with children who have mortgages will be affected and small business owners with mortgages on their properties will be forced out of business.  I hope the new Government — we all have an idea of the complexion it will have — will put its money where its mouth is.  After the review next year, it will have the time to ensure the measure is constitutional and revisit it.I welcome the amendment to the universal social charge and make no apologies for lobbying the Minister for Finance to reduce from 7% to 4% the rate for medical cardholders.  That section of the community cannot afford 7% and needs to be supported.  However, I do not welcome the quick decision made by the mandarins in the Department of Finance and with the obvious agreement of the Minister.  I am glad that my colleague, the Minister of State, is present, as he has listened to me at many meetings around our county in recent months.  While €100,000 is a good income, foisting the shortfall onto the self-employed on the grounds that they can take it is wrong.  They cannot take a further scintilla of tax because they already have been taxed and regulated out of existence.  At a time when there was no regulation of bankers, the self-employed endured health and safety regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, regulations, insurance, courses and so on.Regulating our best and brightest, those who have the courage to invest in business and create money to pay their own wages, provide for their families and create employment, has become an industry.  These people are our future, but they are not receiving help from Enterprise Ireland or the IDA.  Nor do they ask for it.  In some cases, they get good support from local authorities and county enterprise boards.  This has been acknowledged on programmes like "The Frontline".  These are the people Ireland needs to get out of this mire, not us.  They have ideas and the courage and initiative to run with them.  They are our brightest and best.  Some might not be our brightest and best, but they are hard workers.  Sheer hard work has got them to where they are and kept them there for many years.  Crucifying them by regulation must stop.  I welcome Deputy Timmins's comments to this effect.An army of officialdom has crippled our State and grown up around the political system.  My former party has been in government for the longest time.  I lobbied my party to call a halt to matters, but no one wanted them to stop as they were going well.  Instead, people wanted to make money.  Rightly or wrongly, we became associated with big developers and builders.  This is our taint and we must pay the price.  We need to rebuild and revert to the ideals of de Valera and Lemass by setting up a country in which people can be proud to be in business and to have property.  Without such people, we will not have a country.I will address the bringing forward of the deadline for self-assessment tax returns from 31 October to 30 September.  This is another dream by some bright spark —  there are many good officials in the Department — who has never been self-employed, needed to file accounts or understood the difficulties involved.  It is a nonsensical proposal for a number of reasons.  First, cash flow has dried up.  Traditionally, people are paid quarterly or at the end of the year.  One needs money to pay one's self-assessment, but many businesses do not have it.  Banks have been of no help, seeing as how they have removed overdraft facilities and refused to provide loans despite the fact that some of the businesses in question have track records of 30 or 40 years.  They are a safe bet for the banks, but their lifeblood is being drained away.August and September are holiday months for the House and others, so we know that finding an accountant in that period can be difficult.  Accountants would tell one of how their staff are on holidays, meaning there is no one to do the books.  As such, the new deadline is a nonsensical, ill-conceived and ill-judged idea.  Those who dreamed it up have never created a job.  Instead, they will put people out of business.  The new deadline must be reconsidered, as the people who will be affected promote enterprise and are those to whom we must turn.Although we are attracting some multinationals and I compliment all involved in Intel's announcement last week, we are not attracting enough.  Small indigenous businesses must be encouraged and supported.  Banks are not helping them despite last year's budget promise that they would each lend €3 billion.  The Minister told us the banks would submit plans in this respect, but we never saw any plan or money.  The only money we saw was what they took off business people.I welcome the review of the curtailment of tax relief on student fees.  PAYE workers had legitimate complaints in this respect.  The idea that the self-employed could do what they liked led to mistrust, so we must tread with caution.  No tax relief will be afforded on the first €2,000 in charges for full-time students or on the first €1,000 for part-time students.  Among the unemployed of all ages, there is a considerable need to up-skill or retrain to meet the needs of industry and to create growth.  We must support them because they are our brightest and best.  From the figures, we can see how many people have been forced to emigrate.  We want to keep them at home.  To do so, they must be up-skilled and reskilled if they are to be able and willing to create jobs, get work and attract companies to Ireland.  This measure must be examined.I am disappointed about the tax on the bankers' bonuses.  I negotiated with the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on making changes to the cuts in allowances for the disabled, blind people and carers.  He decided to introduce the 90% tax on bonuses, but it has been forgotten.  I do not want to penalise those people, but "bonus" is a dirty word.  Why has it been forgotten?  Departmental officials were allowed their bonuses two weeks later, yet there was not a word about that.  There is no fairness.This Bill ignores an area that has been crying out for reform.  I have consistently argued that, in the interests of fairness and accountability, a maximum wage needs to be introduced.  I was with the Minister until he walked into the Chamber with the budget.  He told me he was introducing a €250,000 cap.  For many years, I had lobbied for €200,000, which would be a fine sum for anyone.  He introduced the measure, but we have not heard a word about it since.  It was tokenism to get the likes of me on side.  The situation is unfair.  A couple of days later, we decreased the minimum wage.  No questions were asked; it was just slashed.  The ordinary people who want to work are being leaned on again.  Worse still, the message being sent is that working is not viable.  One must always have a system in which it is rewarding to work.  It cannot be more rewarding to stay at home.  This is the problem with our lengthening dole queues.The reduction in the minimum wage was an attack on the weakest.  I am an employer and 99% of the employers I know were not troubled by the minimum wage.  They were willing to pay it.  If one has good employees, they are entitled to good pay.  In smaller businesses in particular, there are good relationships between employers and employees.  It is quid pro quo, in that one cannot work without the other.Ordinary people, be they business people or workers, who want to get on with their lives without looking for handouts are being crucified while the rich are getting away with it.  This is the saddest indictment of our outgoing Government and it is something on which I, as someone who was a part of it, must face the public.  However, I reject out of hand an accusation levelled against me.  The Opposition has a responsibility.  If it so wishes, it is ready to do some governance by passing this Bill.I voted against the so-called EU-IMF bailout.  It was a clean out.

By my simple arithmetic, we will need to invest €17.5 billion of our National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, in the bottomless pit that is the banks.  It is a bad deal.  It was negotiated by the mandarins and the Minister, not a business person.  Had a business person advised them, for example, had Albert Reynolds when he was a Deputy or someone with business ideas gone out there, our friends from Europe and the IMF would have come to us the next morning and offered us a betterdeal.I welcome the Opposition's positive promise to renegotiate.  The deal must be renegotiated because we can never repay it.  I believe it was set up for default, either mischievously by the Government or by the Europeans.  I hate the word "default".  Anyone who is in business knows that, if one defaults even once, one is listed in Stubbs Gazette, one’s record is damaged and one’s business and credibility diminishes.  We should have rejected the deal and brought back the EU and IMF, as doing so would have suited the national interest better.I will not put local politics ahead of national politics.  I never got into deals with our Ministers for Finance, but I will stand up for the basic rights of ordinary people who cannot understand what is occurring and were appalled by events in the Oireachtas last week when the Government put party interests ahead of the public interest.  This can never be allowed in politics and the public will deal with it at the ballot box.  It was a fundamentally flawed miscalculation.  I wish the retiring Taoiseach and Ministers the best, but they misread the situation and brought rancour from all over the world down on top of us.Although I am proud to represent my constituents, I am not speaking for them now.  I do not see the wisdom in rushing the Finance Bill through the Dáil.  Last year, it took us until April to pass it.  While we should not continue until next April, we should continue until next week to discuss the Bill properly paragraph by paragraph.  It is a large document.  In recent weeks, we have all been treating it like a Bible and saying it needed to be passed, yet issues have now arisen.  I could not believe it when we adjourned at 8.30 p.m. last night.  I was looking for speaking time and I thank the Chief Whip, Deputy Curran, and his staff for affording me some.  However, I could not believe that we did not sit until midnight or whatever to have some discussion——

The complaints I heard about the guillotine being imposed by the Government of which I was a part ring hollow now.  I respect the fact that the Opposition wants an election, we all want it and the country wants it but we have to give due diligence and due respect to this Bill, and not cherry-pick it.The Opposition has stated it will table amendments on the civil partnership provisions and this is another issue with significant consequences and costs for the taxpayer in the future.  That was rushed legislation and the Greens are pronouncing that they achieved it.  Good riddance to bad rubbish in Government, so far as I am concerned.  I have said many times that they were a dangerous party in Government.  Ideology is fine and they can talk about policies but look at the price of petrol at the pumps.  Thankfully, our coursing festival is being held in Clonmel next week.  I invite each and every Member, if they have an hour to spare on Sunday or Monday to come down to enjoy that festival of rural pursuits at their best and an important industry which attracts foreign investment.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his co-operation and I thank all colleagues, staff and officials for being nice to me while I served in this Dáil.

I thank the Minister of State for agreeing to give us a few more minutes.I wish all Members well, a number of whom will be retiring from the House and it is unlikely that very many or certainly that all of us will be here in this Chamber again.  I have appreciated being here for the past three and a half years and I have always been treated with courtesy and friendship by Members on all sides of the House.We are now in the dying days of this Government but it has been in free fall for many weeks.  This free fall started with the bank guarantee which destroyed the economy and the nation's sovereignty.  The IMF and the EU entered the country unopposed and dictated savage financial conditions for the banks' bail-out on the taxpayers.  The Government went AWOL, so to speak, Fianna Fáil fiddled and the Greens went chasing the stag-hunters of Meath.Today, as the House debates the Finance Bill 2011, there is a very serious aviation dispute taking place between Aer Lingus and the IMPACT trade union.  The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has indicated he plans to retire and has therefore resigned as Minister.  The new Minister for Transport, Deputy Pat Carey, is overwhelmed by multiple responsibilities.  I wish to make a plea that we would not lose sight of what is happening.  This dispute is escalating at a fast rate and more than 180 cabin crew staff, mostly women, have been taken off the payroll and another 21, at least, will be taken off today which means that 20% of the entire cabin crew staff are gone.  Aer Lingus has stated it will be reducing its operations by 10%.  The company is hiring in carriers such as Ryanair and others and it is spending significant sums in an effort to break this dispute.  This is not the way forward.  Any Government and Minister worth their salt would be intervening at this stage.This is a long-running dispute which has escalated over the past two weeks and has gone out of control.  I ask that the new Minister for Transport, Deputy Pat Carey, would use his good offices to intervene to speak to both parties, to Aer Lingus management and to IMPACT.  This State has a 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus.  If necessary, the Minister should arrange for third party mediation, binding arbitration, as this will resolve the dispute.  If the Minister for Transport is not listening in the House today I ask the Minister of State to relay that request.  We are dealing with Fianna Fáil elections, a Finance Bill and a budget ——

The Minister also promised to deal with the bonus payments paid in bodies now under the State guarantee but he did not do so.  A job creation scheme is essential but nothing has been put in place to support job creation.  The opportunity to improve the budget and to put together a proper Finance Bill has been lost.  A new Government will need to intervene.  I hope a new, fresh Labour-led Government will be in control to try to improve the situation and to give some hope to the country in the future.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	140	This is no way to enact a Finance Bill but then, this is no way to govern a country, with a half of a Cabinet, and with a Taoiseach driving through a truncated Finance Bill that has been dictated from Frankfurt, Brussels and Washington.  This is a Finance Bill to legislate for a budget that had a majority in the House on budget night but now the Minister for Finance is bartering with Independents to conclude the process.  The reckless mismanagement of our country's affairs has made a severe budget unavoidable and this is the most severe budget of modern times.However, severe or not, this House is entitled to demand that the measures being enshrined in law are fair.  The manner in which the universal social charge is being introduced is not fair.  It is not credible in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, to argue that 45% of what the Minister calls, "tax units", pay no tax.  However, to bring in a new universal charge that kicks in at an annual income of €4,000 is manifestly unfair.  Workers on low incomes are hit by a double whammy.  This Government has cut the minimum wage and introduced the universal social charge.I welcome the minor change for medical card-holders announced yesterday by the Minister, the cost of which will be sourced from high earners.  However, he could hardly have persisted with the universal social charge that had an employee on €35,000 per annum losing €12 per week while the self-employed person earning more than €200,000 per annum was gaining €11 per week.In view of the brief time available I will summarise my contribution.  The cumulative tax changes brought in by the present Minister for Finance are so severe that there is no further scope for increases in personal taxation for anyone earning less than €100,000 per annum.  The Labour Party alternative budget before Christmas would have raised some €870 million in personal taxes.  The actual increases imposed by Fianna Fáil in this budget increase personal income taxes by €1.2 billion.  We cannot further tax people on low and middle incomes.The challenge facing whoever comprises the new Government is to wriggle out of the strait-jacket that is the legacy of the outgoing Government.  We have no choice but to get our public finances under control but we cannot bear the burden imposed on us by the IMF-EU bail-out.  Our sovereign wealth fund, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, has been thrown into the pot by the Government in the bailout negotiations.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund will be cleaned out before the end of the current year.  Our freedom of movement to stimulate growth is severely restricted.  Everyone knows that unless our economy can be returned to growth, the kind of growth that produces employment, that begins to put people back to work, we will be unable to pay our way.Finally, I must mention the huge bitterness among the public about what the banks have done to our country.  Ordinary people are convinced that no banker will be required to hang his Armani suit on the back of a door in Mountjoy Prison.  The circumstances and the damage done to our standing in the Councils of the European Union, where we used to punch above our weight, where our networking was professional and effective, has been damaged in recent years.  As a result, the ECB kicked around this country when it came to agreeing the terms of the bailout.If it is true — as it undoubtedly is — that our banks behaved recklessly, it is also true that those who loaned to them behaved recklessly and the terms of that IMF-ECB bailout was as much to protect the eurozone and to protect German and French banks as it was to aid Ireland.   The first challenge for whoever comprises the new Government will be to revisit that bailout and take advantage of developments happening in the wider eurozone to negotiate a eurozone-wide debt relief programme which would give some freedom to move in this country and some capacity to lift the restrictions to stimulate growth and to get people back to work again.

The Government finds itself in a minority position and the House finds itself in a position where it must face its national responsibilities without recourse to cheap and easy rhetoric.  The House must decide what is in the best interests of the country in terms of the Finance Bill.  The enactment of this legislation is vital to our international credibility and this has been made clear by the European Commission and in all of the international commentary about which there has been comment during the debate.There has been much attention in media reports regarding the possibility of reduced interest charges being agreed for the EU loan assistance to Ireland.  Many Deputies have raised this issue, including Deputy Rabbitte near the conclusion of the debate.  I assure the House that I have been as vigorous on this subject in practice as the Members of the Opposition have been in talk.  I will attend the relevant European meetings in February irrespective of the fact that a general election is taking place to ensure that Ireland's vital interests are fully protected in this matter.

These are difficult complex negotiations involving many member states and the interest rates were set and determined well in advance of any application by Ireland.  This is the factual position.  Following the agreement with Ireland, Greece sought the same terms so it is not correct to state our arrangement was less favourable.  It was in accordance with precedent.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	149	There was no precedent.

Talk about renegotiation is entirely fallacious.  What is needed is hard determined negotiation, building up relationships where we have them and ensuring these changes take place.  I assure the House that in so far as the negotiations take place prior to polling day I will participate in them——

Deputies Noonan, O'Donnell and Maureen O'Sullivan raised the question of burden sharing.  This is provided for in the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  We know senior bondholders rank equally with depositors in having claims in Irish banks.  We know the long debate in Ireland on the mere possibility of default has caused immense problems for the Irish banking system.  If one insists that one will torch a house does one expect to leave the house next door alone and leave one's deposit in it?  This has been the quality of debate on this subject in this country for the past two years and we have paid a heavy price for it.  Again, these issues will be determined in co-operation with our European partners——

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	156	——because we are in an arrangement whereby our funding comes from the European Central Bank and any progress in this area will have to be made in co-operation with it.  It will not be possible to take unilateral measures in this respect and any party which in the course of the campaign promises unilateral default measures is misleading and deceiving the people.Deputy Noonan raised the question of Spanish banks.  The Spanish Government announced that its banks will have to raise more capital.  This is the same as what is happening here under the EU support programme.Deputies raised the issue of the universal social charge.  I will consider the issue Deputy Noonan raised on the threshold but it is necessary to have an exemption threshold at the lower end of the charge to avoid very low levels of income attaching to a tax liability.  I am pleased that Deputy Noonan has welcomed my proposed Committee Stage amendments.  He has, however, questioned the surcharge on self-employed income being applied at income levels of €100,000 rather than at income levels of €200,000 where the gain first appears.  I must inform the Deputy that the gain only occurs at €200,000 and above but first shows itself as a diminishing loss on earnings from €100,000.  If the surcharge were placed at income levels of €200,000, those above that level would still gain from the budget.  I can provide the Deputy with a table that demonstrates this effect.Deputy Noel Ahern queried why the 3% surcharge would apply only to self-employed income earners.  This is because an unintended effect of introducing the social charge was that self-employed income earners above certain high levels of income actually made a gain from the original budget measures.  The surcharge rectifies the position.  Deputy Burton stated the highest income earners actually benefited as a result of the budget.  This is simply not the case.  All PAYE workers regardless of their income levels are worse off after the budget.  It gives me no joy to state this but it is the factual position.With regard to Deputy Burton's confusion over the nature of the universal social charge, let me make clear that the charge is a tax.  All revenue goes to the central fund and is then used to fund services and other expenditure.  It is certainly correct that the revenue from the health levy went directly to fund health services but this accounted for only 13% of what the HSE required in 2010.With regard to the changes to self assessment, I refer to the points made by Deputies, in particular Deputy O'Donnell.  It is true that implementation of the proposals would reduce the over-concentration of tax receipts in late October and mid-November and thus enhance the accuracy of next-year budget forecasting.  It would also help facilitate an earlier budget and lengthen the period available for the development of policy and legislation for the Finance Bill.  As many Deputies, including Deputies Roche and O'Connor have noted, the Finance Bill is one of the key pieces of legislation which goes through the Oireachtas and needs an appropriate level of commitment from all parties.  However, bringing forward the pay and file deadline to 30 September would have a huge negative impact this year on small businesses and the self employed.  Deputy Lowry advised me the harsh treatment of the self-employed is unfair.  Likewise, Deputy Healy-Rae made a strong case in this regard.  This measure would also have serious consequences for farmers because the single farm payment will not have been paid by 30 September, leaving farmers with no financial resources to make this payment prior to the deadline.  In all these circumstances I am prepared not to proceed with the proposal to bring forward the pay and file deadline to 30 September.  It was a worthy proposal and would have improved our budgetary process.  It would have removed the criticism that we are constrained to introduce a budget in early December but one must weigh up this against the real difficulties which the self-employed and farmers face in the Irish economy and this is not the year for such a fundamental reform.  Hence, I will not proceed with this particular element of the Finance Bill.  It was not part of the original budgetary measures and therefore I am free to not proceed with the matter and I do not propose to do so.It is appalling and unacceptable that the proposed taxation measures on bankers' bonuses were not dealt with because of the time restrictions placed on the passage of the Bill by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  I noted what Deputy Mattie McGrath stated a few moments ago in this regard that the constraint in the discussion on the Finance Bill to one week rather than two constrained the Department in what we could do.  Nevertheless, having discussed the matter with my officials and having regard to what Deputy Mattie McGrath raised with me I will be in a position to bring forward an amendment on bankers' bonuses on Committee Stage.  However, I will need all-party co-operation on this amendment because it has not been published with the other Committee Stage amendments.  I know it is an issue about which all sides of the House are concerned.A number of other tax issues were raised in the course of the debate.

This has been a tremendous week in one sense in that political parties on all sides have had to face up to their responsibilities for once.  I hope we can face up to our responsibilities in the course of the national debate that is now beginning.  One thing about the Finance Bill which has become very clear to me, and which applies in a wider sense to the management of our finances and expenditure, is that one cannot make a concession without providing for how the concession can be paid for elsewhere.  This is how our public finances will be managed in the future irrespective of what Government is in office.If one wants a concession on a particular tax matter, one will need to show how it will be paid for on the other side of the account.  If one wants an increased expenditure somewhere, one will need to explain what additional taxation or what reduced expenditure will fund it.  That is basic public finance and it will apply in this House from now on.  We have begun to see signs of it in this debate, which is very welcome.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 7, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"PART 1Cost Benefit Analysis of Tax Expenditures1.—The Minister shall within one month from the passing of this Act prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on a cost-benefit analysis of tax expenditures provided for by this Act, setting out the costs of tax foregone, and the benefits in terms of job creation or otherwise.".The purpose of this amendment is to ask the Minister to do what he committed to do in the debate on the Finance Bill last year and what he indicated to us would become a standard part of the Finance Bill — that is, the presentation of a cost-benefit analysis of tax expenditures provided for by the Act.Despite the suggestion, which has been strongly made by Fianna Fáil in recent times, that tax expenditures and tax breaks for very wealthy people are in some ways being curtailed and phased out, the reality is that while there is a promise of curtailment of some tax breaks in this budget, the only tax expenditure which has been entirely removed is the tax relief on trade union subscriptions.  We do not have a particular difficulty with that but people who pay subscriptions to professional associations, if their firms pay them, will continue to get full tax relief.I am concerned that we have a number of new schemes in this budget, yet have no idea what their cost-benefit analysis is.  I am disturbed that Fianna Fáil has decided to reject evidence-based policy-making in extending a major new programme of tax breaks to different private firms.  We have already welcomed some of these breaks, such as those that amend investment in research and development.  However, we now have a major change to what was the business expansion or BES scheme, which is now to be transformed into a new scheme.  We were told that in the 2006 survey of the BES scheme there was no cost-benefit analysis but a survey of the beneficiaries of the survivors.  We also got the names of the various companies.  At that point, however, the Government's own advisers, Indecon, recommended that extensions to tax-incentive schemes should only be considered after evaluation of the results in a formal cost-benefit appraisal.The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that that analysis takes place and is published within one month of the enactment of the Finance Bill.  The new BITES scheme, which succeeds the former BES scheme, is designed to support innovation and employment.  Those are two tax-support concepts which the Labour Party would support provided they are targeted and costed.  In addition, their timespan must be clearly planned and set out.We know that previous and current property-based tax breaks were a key part of the downfall of the Celtic tiger.  The landmark Regling-Watson report on the cause of the Irish financial crisis and banking collapse, clearly stated that the crash was home made.  It also said that a significant contributor to the crash was the extraordinary availability of tax breaks linked to property development and construction.  Despite all the rhetoric we still have tax breaks focused on building private hospitals, even though the HSE has announced that the private hospital initiative is at an end.  We have all received a significant number of representations, both from individuals who are using section 23 tax breaks, but more significantly from professional lobbyists for these breaks, including accounting and legal firms.  In addition, charities have been established for the purpose of availing of private hospital tax breaks.  Essentially, however, we have no costings.  What we got from these organisations was a case as to why their commercial activity of selling schemes, on which they charge very high fees to those investing in them, should be continued.There is almost no solid information explaining who are the people who currently have and would be affected by changes in section 23.  The Minister gave us no such information.  Individuals who have invested in one property for a pension could be very easily dealt with, as opposed to some of the schemes involved.  Investors in these schemes got ripped off big time by some of the firms selling such schemes because a large amount of their putative tax saving was taken in fees they paid to professional advisers to set up and structure the financial deals.  That is one of the reasons this country's economy, banks and construction boom crashed.  If we want to prevent that from recurring in future there is a role for targeted tax incentives which are subject to a cost-benefit analysis.  As well as having a specific timeframe, they should have a clear consideration for employment and innovation content.  The Labour Party would be happy to support something like that, but this country simply cannot afford to extend tax breaks willy-nilly without any idea of the cost-benefits involved.Last year, the Dáil voted to accept this amendment and the Minister produced an evaluation of schemes a month afterwards.  There were very few hard figures in it concerning the cost-benefit analysis.  There was just a summary of the lobbyists' views of what the schemes would do, together with some notes from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.     This country's tax breaks industry expects to write the Finance Bill and to make amendments to it which are favourable to the industry.  Given my own background as a chartered accountant, I understand that it is a legitimate part of the roles of accountants and lawyers to provide taxation services but these schemes have brought the economy down.  At this late stage, we ask that they be subjected to a cost benefit analysis to be published within a month.I wish to speak about the transfer of the business expansion scheme to the BITE scheme.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners know that because it constitutes a state aid, it must go to the EU for examination and evaluation.  This big new scheme seems extraordinary.  It is very wide in its potential reach.  While I agree with the objective of transforming the business expansion scheme to concentrate on innovation and employment, I suggest we should ensure it is ring-fenced to avoid a build-up of the abuses of the past, with which we are all so familiar.I would say the Minister has known since early last autumn that he needed to change the business expansion scheme.  Although the scheme was responsible for a great deal of important investment at certain stages, in its later days many clever accountants and tax lawyers were able to convert it, like everything else, into a largely property-based scheme.  Many hotels availed of it.  Such use of the scheme is among the reasons we ended up with a tragic over-supply of hotels.  Many owners of traditional family hotels, who had made a long-term business commitment to the hotel and hospitality trade, became disadvantaged as a result and were jumped into availing of tax breaks at the end of the property boom.  Their firms have been left with serious financial and structural difficulties.I wish to comment on the system of tax breaks for business that we would like to see develop.  We do not want tax breaks like those of recent years, which existed to boost the construction industry and caused the bubble to rise to an extraordinary extent before it collapsed.  Equally, we do not want a system that serves as a corporate welfare scheme.  We want a rigorous debate on the various schemes.  We want the employment, innovation and research benefits of schemes to be clearly laid out for all to see.  We want investment criteria to be in place.  We want them to be targeted at investment, employment, research and innovation.  That has to happen.  We will need to do our business in such a way, which is implied in the memorandum of understanding with the IMF and the EU, in the future.  I recommend the Labour Party amendment to the House.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I want to make a few remarks on Deputy Burton's amendment.  The introduction of a tax break as a lever should be available to the makers of public policy.  When people get a tax break if they behave in a certain way, they are likely to behave in that way.  When that course of action is more expensive, they are likely not to pursue it.  The first time I heard about the use of tax breaks was in the context of efforts to encourage the redevelopment of port areas of certain American cities.  Derelict parts of the port area of New York, for example, were revitalised.  A beautiful urban development was facilitated principally through tax breaks.  The redevelopment of old areas of infrastructure, such as railway yards, which had become obsolete was driven in that way.  I have seen the huge tax-driven developments that revitalised the city of St. Louis.  That was imitated here.When I was in government in the 1980s, the late John Boland introduced a raft of tax incentives.  He was the first Minister to legislate for urban development in Ireland to be driven by tax breaks.  He designated 39 acres of dereliction in my home city of Limerick.  It was revitalised and rebuilt over a period of seven or eight years.  Such an approach works well.A social response is sometimes required.  I recall a time when there was a huge shortage of nursing homes and nursing home beds in this country.  After discussing the issue with us, the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, introduced a tax break to encourage the supply of nursing homes.  The investors came in very quickly and, for a short period, we probably reached a point at which there was a surplus of availability in nursing homes.  That was driven by tax breaks.  We should not dump on the concept of tax breaks as a lever of public policy because they can encourage investors to meet economic and social needs.  People respond to the profit incentive.I agree with Deputy Burton that tax breaks were carried too far in Ireland.  The stimulation of building and development through tax breaks, regardless of the end product, became one of the objectives of the tax break industry.  Problems arose when it was decided to allow people to write off the rent of whatever they built against their rental income elsewhere in the State.  That was fatal.  There was no real analysis of whether the existence of 25 houses on the banks of the River Shannon in County Leitrim was of economic benefit to the local area.  How could it have had any viability in itself, if its purpose was to ensure one did not pay tax on property one rented in Dublin?  That kind of cross-matching destroyed the situation.I always thought it extraordinary that tax breaks were treated as farmers used to treat milk quota, in that it could be bought and sold separately from the farm.  It was a tradeable asset.  I could never understand how tax credits became a tradeable asset.  In one case I know of, a building was built with capital allowances and sold to an investor who took in the rent, while the tax credits arising from its building were sold as a tradeable commodity——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Yes.  Was that in Limerick?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	185	——to somebody who had never had anything to do with building or development.  It was a deal purely to reduce the person's income tax liability.  It was the extension of the tax break industry that destroyed it.  This has resulted in a situation in which the man and woman on the street are saying that tax breaks are a bad idea and they should all be abolished.  It was in view of this that the Minister, when introducing the budget, said that all section 23 allowances and other capital allowances would be abolished immediately.  I always thought that had a doubtful legal basis, because people who had entered into arrangements when investing in property were under contract, and the concept of legitimate expectation applied.  There was a legitimate expectation that the arrangement would run until the end of the period for which the contract was signed.I always thought — and I suggested at the time — that it would be a better arrangement if the Government had, because of the financial crisis and in the national interest, suspended the benefits for four years, so that in 2015, when times were better and the Exchequer could afford it, investors could again receive the benefit of the tax break.  I think this would pass legal muster, and many investors would not have objected to it because rents are currently so low that they are not availing of the full tax credit anyway.  Another major issue is that people have made arrangements with their banks for schedules of repayment, and the removal of the tax break would take the floor out from under these schedules.  A deferral would not have done that, and it would have allowed investors to renegotiate deals with the banks.Deputies Costello and Barrett are anxious to speak, so I will not continue.  However, I ask the Minister to consider this again, as he has said he will do, and take these views into account.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I am pleased to have an opportunity of speaking on this series of amendments.  It is quite a large group, covering amendments Nos. 1 to 38, but I will focus only on one or two points.Deputy Burton referred to the tax break industry, and that is effectively what it is.  At the IBEC annual forum in Tralee last year, it was stated that approximately €11 billion worth of tax reliefs are given to the private sector annually.  That is an incredible amount.  If we take out of this mortgage relief and so on, we are left with the three major areas of property, landlord and pension tax relief.  All three of these are effectively out of control.  Some people have collected enormous pension pots.  We have heard that Mr. Fingleton, for example, has a pension pot of €28 million and that he may have organised tax relief on all of it.  It is incredible that the man was getting all his millions virtually scot free.  It is unacceptable that this has not been regulated until now.It boggles the imagination to read, in the Minister's introductory speech on Second Stage, his comments on property-related tax expenditure.  What was announced in the budget was that tax relief on such expenditure was to be abolished or substantially cut.  Guess what the Government has decided now, in the intervening six weeks?  The Minister stated that the provisions "will now be subject to a commencement provision which may only take effect in the next tax year following the preparation and publication of an economic impact assessment on the proposed changes".  Imagine that.  One would have thought that before putting it into the budget the Minister would have carried out an assessment of the proposal, which would be properly researched and published.Having introduced the provision in the budget, the Minister now says he must do all the ground work.  Where are we going?  What he said was code for saying that the property tax relief industry got to him, and he has taken the provision out of the Finance Bill.  What we thought was a substantial measure in December has now disappeared.  What will happen now?  The Minister, God help us, will not even be here another month, but he will do some research and produce a paper which will appear some time in the future.  What is being proposed is outrageous.This is the kind of thing that gives the Finance Bill a bad name — when vested interests get to the Minister in the period between the Budget Statement and the introduction of the Bill.  We should be considering all property-related tax exemptions.  I am not saying they should be abandoned, although by and large it is time to move away from them.  Section 22 and section 23 property tax reliefs were part and parcel of the collapse of our economy and one of the reasons for the state the country is in.  We should seriously consider phasing out such reliefs.  A total of €11 billion is handed over by the taxpayer to various interests, largely in the form of pension-, landlord- and property-related incentives.  It is not good enough.  Until this is dealt with transparently, we are going nowhere.  The proposed change by the Minister is a bad one, and I welcome the proposal by Deputy Burton to ensure we assess all such measures in the future so that if they do not provide decent value we can get rid of them.There is a valuable proposal in the Finance Bill to introduce tax reliefs for improving energy efficiency in residential premises.  That is very welcome.  However, the total amount of relief available in a year for this is €30 million, which compares badly with the €11 billion in existing tax reliefs of various types.  For a tax relief that will achieve something desirable and get some economic activity going in the building industry we are providing a measly €30 million, while we refrain from abolishing the reliefs that are going into the pockets of developers to make obscene profits.  I find the Finance Bill to be obscene in this regard.One issue that should be dealt with by the Bill is that of self-employed people who receive nothing if they lose their jobs.  They are not entitled to normal social welfare payments and they have no pensions.  For example, as spokesperson on transport, I am dealing with this problem as it pertains to taxi drivers.  There are 27,000 taxi drivers in the State and, in the old days, they had the nest egg of the value of the taxi plate.  That has disappeared.  When they cease to drive their taxis, they will not have a penny for their retirement.  There is no lump sum, there is nothing for them except what they might get from social welfare, which is difficult enough at present.Taxi drivers are not the only ones facing this situation, even in the transport area.  Self-employed hauliers also have no pensions.  Is this not something that should be considered seriously by the Minister?  Surely we should be bringing self-employed people into some kind of pension bond which would provide an incentive for them to contribute.  We could use the National Pensions Reserve Fund as a mechanism to encourage something of this nature, rather than leaving such people high and dry.Finally, I will say a word about bonuses.  I was speaking, I believe, on the last day of the Dáil in December and the Minister for Finance was on the other side.  The Minister for Finance said that he was going to introduce a 90% tax on all bonuses being received by the financial institutions that were subject to the banking guarantee.  Those are the institutions, effectively, the State has bailed out and some of them are now nationalised.  He further said, because we were discussing the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill, that he could not introduce it in that legislation, although that seemed the most relevant Bill to provide for it, as the notice was too short, but by God he was going to have his 90% tax on those bonuses in the coming year in the Finance Bill.  Lo and behold, it has disappeared entirely, just like the snow we had in December.  It no longer exists.Deputies will recall we were discussing the €40 million in bonuses for AIB managers in December, that had just been announced.  I understand that is due to be paid out next month.  The Minister had his opportunity to act on that but he has not.  Neither has he acted as regards any future bonuses.  Unless the Minister comes clean and says these areas, which have the country driven mad, are rooted out then this Government and this legislation have no credibility.Serious issues arise in sections 1 to 38, inclusive, that need to be addressed and which should be amended in the opposite direction to that being proposed by the Minister.  The Labour Party believes strongly that the areas of property tax breaks and bonuses, which have corrupted the banking sector, should be addressed in this Bill because they are live, demanding issues and have brought the country to its knees.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Following on from what Deputy Costello had to say as regards people having some type of pension, I believe a system should be introduced whereby everybody contributes towards an old age pension.  It is the easy to arrange.  Again, we have been fiddling around with private pension funds to satisfy the failure to deal with this issue.  I shall expand on that in a moment.Everybody should have to make a PRSI payment, including the self-employed.  An unemployed person should get credits, in the event, until he or she can get employment to retain his or her benefit.  It is crazy that in the case of those who do not contribute the only thing they can apply for is a non-contributary old age pension.  As a result of this stupid changes are being introduced here to the present approved retirement fund, ARF, system — where people cannot avail of an ARF unless they have an income of €18,000.  They then have to put a lump sum into an approved minimum retirement fund, ARMF, and leave it there until they are 75.  This is a crazy way of interfering with people's personal rights.  None of it was mentioned in the Budget Statement.  It came out of the blue and was leaked to some people in the industry.I received this Bill on Monday, today is Wednesday and we are being asked to make major changes in respect of an ARF scheme within two days.  There is no reason why this section should not be taken out and re-introduced in the finance Bill (No. 2), which I understand is under preparation within the Department of Finance.  There is no loss of revenue involved, other than what was announced on budget day, so it is simple to do.  I appeal to the Minister to stop messing around with these.The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, introduced this in 1999, because the only option somebody had on retirement — given the amount of money in the fund — was either to take the benefit, if he or she was in a scheme or, if self-employed, to purchase an annuity.  Annuities, by and large, die with the person, however, which means that the State gets less income tax as a result of somebody dying after the guaranteed period of five years.  The funds then go back to the insurance company and no tax is paid on them.  It was discovered in 1999 when this was introduced that the annuity rates were based on a male living until 81, which was totally out of order.  It was a rip-off.  For the first time we loosened this up and people did not like it, particularly those in the annuity market, because they were losing a great deal of revenue.The introduction of the ARF scheme meant that the State got tax on every penny in the fund, irrespective of when a person died, because the fund would pass into his or her estate and tax would be collected.  From the State's viewpoint it is far better to have people in an ARF, therefore, than in an annuity, yet the Government is now introducing changes that push people out of ARFs, and making them less attractive.  Who wants to leave money in a fund until he or she is 75?  Either one has a State pension or one does not.For those who are not drawing down, the amount that they must take is increased from 3% to 5%.  What is the reason for that?  Very little extra tax will be collected but for those on small pensions the funds will run out quicker than normal.  The whole idea of the ARF system was to make it flexible for people because, for example, people who retire sometimes might have children in full-time education or children getting married and therefore need more money in the early years of retirement as against what is required in the latter years.  This gave flexibility, so that somebody could take more in the first couple of years than in the last couple of years of retirement.  That flexibility is not available in annuities.  I do not understand why these changes are being rushed in when there is no need for them, with the effect of upsetting this whole market.On the question of pension funds, it is far more important to encourage people to save.  We should be trying to make certain, as far as possible, within the restrictions being imposed by Ireland's membership of the European Union, to make it attractive for those funds to be invested in this country, and not outside.  To do this a small levy should be imposed on such funds on an annual basis.  Fine Gael, in its budget submission, recommended that 0.5% of a fund should be taken by the State.  These are changes that could be made, while at the same time protecting the whole pensions industry.In case anybody believes I have a vested interest, I was an insurance broker, but am no longer involved in that area although I happen to have a knowledge of it.  What is being displayed here shows that those who are imposing these changes do not have a clue what they are doing.  I ask that members of the pensions industry be invited into a committee of the Oireachtas where we can debate all these issues.  It is for these reasons I am upset this will not get proper attention during our consideration of this Bill.   I appeal to the Minister to remove this measure from the Bill and leave it until the finance (No. 2) Bill.A large volume of money could be used for investment to create jobs.  The Minister can tax it but he should not start fiddling with what people can put into their pension fund.  In any case, they will pay tax when money is coming out.  The idea of pensions is that one receives tax relief when putting money in and one pays tax when it is taken out.  The only thing the State must worry about is the amount of money that can be taken in a lump sum.  This section contains that point.  I do not have great difficulty with it.  I have a slight difficulty with the amounts chosen because there can be a conflict between a pension fund that is part of a pension scheme where the employee can take 1.5 times the final salary and how this compares with the lump sum under an approved retirement fund.The Department of Social Protection was charging PRSI on payments from approved retirement funds and insists these are investment funds.  That is incorrect; they are the same as an annuity and one should not pay PRSI on them.  Those who are retired should not pay PRSI.  The Department has now come round to the idea that one should not pay PRSI beyond the age of 66.  There is no reason why they were charging PRSI because no benefit is given to the person paying PRSI.As a result of changes in the budget, those receiving the approved retirement funds are being taxed at the January 2011 rates and are also being charged the universal social charge when the payment is from the 2010 fund.  I ask the Minister of State to contact his officials to find out why one can tax someone from payments in 2010 at rates included in the Finance Bill 2011.  Insurance companies tell me they are obliged to do so by the Revenue Commissioners.  I fail to understand why we should have to pay tax at the new rate when the tax did not apply to the moneys earned in the previous year.  This should be checked out.  I appeal to the Minister of State to leave this section until the finance (No. 2) Bill.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I was going to comment on amendment No. 1 but there is nothing wrong with it and perhaps I should not interfere when there is an obvious disagreement between the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  I am on the side of Deputy Noonan.  The report of Regling and Watson is being misquoted by Deputy Burton.  It was made clear by Mr. Regling that every country in the world, and certainly in the EU, has tax breaks and arrangements such as this.  The point concerns the extent and the level——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	190	On a point of order——
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I am being brief and Deputy Burton spoke at some length.  The report by Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson concerns the extent, duration and level of some of the property tax breaks.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that they are an important stimulus tool for a Government.  Deputy Costello made the same point.  The Minister of State has more or less agreed with the amendment by deferring the changes to section 23 until after the assessment.  It was always the intention to carry out an assessment during the year.  He has deferred the implementation until the assessment is done.The Minister announced changes to the universal social charge.  After the budget, an issue was highlighted concerning the theoretical self-employed person on €300,000.  This person might have benefited from the budget.  The change recommended by the Minister puts an extra charge on people over €100,000 whereas the original anomaly concerned those earning over €300,000.  Self-employed people earning between €100,000 and €150,000 feel the change has over-compensated.  In his closing contribution on Second Stage, the Minister for Finance referred to a document showing the different levels.  I would appreciate a copy of such a document.  The suggestion is that in regard to company directors or employees, the self-employed person on a salary of over €100,000 has been jumped on.  A correction was needed for those earning €300,000 but the compensation has been overdone.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	193	On a point of order, an amendment of mine has been accepted by the Ceann Comhairle in respect of the publication of bankers' bonuses.  My other amendments were not accepted and I ask Deputy Doherty to allow me a moment to point out that amendment No. 4 reads:In page 7, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"PART 1PUBLICATION OF CERTAIN BONUSES1.—Each credit institution that is participating in the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme shall be required, within 30 days of the passing of this Act, to submit to Dáil Éireann details of the names of all of its officers, employees or contractors to whom bonuses have been paid between 30 September 2008 and the date of passing of this Act, and the amount of the bonuses in each case.".

This is an act of political codology.  A number of speakers referred to the truncation of this Bill and the inadequate time allocated to it.  In reality, the party finance spokespersons have facilitated this Bill in truncated form.  None of the arguments I have heard was raised at the meeting with the Minister for Finance.We must be honest.  It is extremely unlikely any of the amendments tabled will be accepted.  We are trying to make our position again and again to the Minister and pointing out that when this blows up in the Government's face, the record will show that we believed this to be a damaging Finance Bill for the people of the country.  It will not get us out of the economic difficulties we are in.Amendment No. 4 deals with the bankers' bonuses and it is important that we deal with it.  When the budget resolutions were passed in December 2010, what priority did the Minister for Finance give to his officials?  Did he tell them that bankers' bonuses were an issue?  I have already pledged to introduce a scheme to tax bankers' bonuses at 90%.  Did the Minister tell his officials to prioritise bankers' bonuses in view of the fact that a couple of months remained to get the Bill through?  Did he tell them to prioritise the universal social charge, which takes people earning as little as €80 into the tax net?I listened to members of Fine Gael say yesterday that they would accept the universal social charge if the threshold was increased by €1,000, which would mean people earning less than €100 would come under the application of the universal social charge.The first amendment deals with the economic impact assessment——

The first amendment deals with the economic impact of provisions of this Bill and how they will impact on the job creation.  We have read in the newspapers of massive job losses in the retail sector.  We know that they are happening already because the Minister has reduced the spending power of every citizen.  I refer to the people who spend all the money they have day in, day out.  The Minister has taken primarily €2 billion out of their pockets through a range of measures, brought them deeper into the tax net through the tax bands, made changes to tax reliefs, introduced the universal social charge and abolished reliefs such as the reliefs on university charges.  These measures will blow up in the Government's face when the time comes.

It is clear that the rush in dealing with the amendments was to facilitate the Fianna Fáil leadership debate and election at 2 p.m.  Fianna Fáil has put its interests and the election of its leader above democratic debate in this House.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I understand these sections address excise rates and a number of other matters.  I am particularly interested in the provisions on excise rates in respect of hydrocarbon products.  The Green Party's position was to seek to impose carbon taxes on various items, but differentiating between carbon taxes, excises and VAT impositions is difficult, given that all three apply to hydrocarbons.  What are the proportions of excise, VAT and carbon tax levied on, for example, a litre of petrol or diesel?I drive a diesel car and I find diesel to be more expensive now than it was last year.  A barrel of oil costs approximately $90 whereas it cost $140 just prior to this time last year, yet what we pay at the pumps now is significantly more than what it was then.  This despite the fact that the price of the raw material has almost dropped by 50%.  In Ireland, the higher prices must be attributable to new taxes.  Since the Government went easy on its excise increases, which would kick on into VAT, the new carbon tax introduced on the proposal of the Green Party must be causing the difficulty.  The middle of a recession when jobs are being lost hourly is not a great time to increase the costs to industry and to employment.  Does the Minister of State possess a breakdown, schedule or other information that shows which elements of the price are excise, VAT and carbon tax?
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I am opposed to these sections, which will impose a significant additional cost on businesses across the State.  The consequence will be a significant drop in competitiveness, which will cost us jobs.  The increase in the excise on diesel is punitive.The Government constantly preached to us that it needed to cut the minimum wage to make the economy more competitive and to help business, yet here it is doing the exact opposite, namely, increasing the cost of doing business.  Jobs will fall asunder as a result.  We are constantly told by the Government that it is doing something about jobs, but we never see anything concrete being done to create or save jobs.  This significant gap is one of the reasons the Bill will be a disaster for the people of this island, never mind this State.The Government also expects people who live in rural areas to pay an additional cost for fuel when they have no alternative.  Large swathes of this land have no public transport, so people have no option but to have motorised transport of their own.  The Bill will apply a considerable additional punishment on people in rural areas.  It is unacceptable, but I will listen to the Minister of State.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I agree with my colleague, Deputy Noonan, concerning this tax.  The price of diesel and petrol is having a terrible effect on rural Ireland.  I have often put on the record of the Dáil my belief that the Green Party's carbon tax is simply a tax on rural Ireland.  It is not right.  This winter, people needed to buy fuel to cope with the cold weather.  Deputy Noonan made a valid point.  If oil is $90 per barrel, the Government and the country have not dealt with the problem of the price we pay at the pumps.  We are being ripped off again.  It is the old thing of rip-off Ireland at every opportunity.  In the week prior to the heavy snow and before we were promised bad weather, I bought two bags of salt for €7.  The following week, I went to the same place on behalf of a neighbour and found that the price had increased to €7 per bag.  This is the reason our country is the way it is.  At every opportunity, we rip one another off.We all want to be environmentally friendly, but a carbon tax affects people's pockets and we in rural Ireland need our cars or other vehicles.  We do not have Dublin Bus, the Luas or other forms of public transport.

The woman needed to bring her child to Westdoc.  She travelled approximately 50 miles from Carratigue to Ballina to meet a doctor, not a consultant in a hospital.  Her family is in receipt of social welfare payments and cannot afford this type of cost.  It is fine for the Green Party and for the Fianna Fáil Ministers.  For the past 13 years, the latter have not bought a gallon of petrol or diesel, have not had a meal they needed to pay for and have not known what has been occurring in the real world.

#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	257	The first point to make about the rate of mineral oil taxes is that the expected yield from the increases in 2011, inclusive of VAT, is approximately €106 million.  Were we not to proceed with these changes, we would need to find €106 million elsewhere.  While it is correct that people in rural areas are more dependent on car and motorised transport generally, in principle the carbon tax affects everyone who drives regardless of the parts of the country in which they live.I was asked for the details concerning the current percentage component of carbon tax.Anyone who crosses the Border will be aware that petrol and diesel prices are still significantly higher in the North than in the South with an approximate difference of 10% to 15% in price.  The carbon tax element on a litre of petrol costing €1.19 is 4.2 cent, inclusive of VAT.  In the case of diesel, it is 4.9 cent on a litre of diesel costing €1.10.  Despite what Deputy Ring assumes, I buy diesel and if I knew anywhere it was being sold for €1.10 a litre, I would be around there pretty smartly.  In my experience of recent pricing, it is more likely to cost €1.36 or €1.38.  I think the tabular information with which I have been supplied is somewhat out of date.The total excise on petrol is 57.6 cent per litre, of which the carbon tax is 3 cent.  The point being made in the information is that carbon tax is a small additional element.  I suspect that the next international crisis could be an oil-related one.  We have to try to be more efficient and more economical in the use of petrol.  A small level of carbon tax is a financial incentive to be economical.  Irrespective of this one element, it is also a case that the State needs the revenue.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I wish to raise a point relating to section 46 of the Bill which makes a number of amendments to Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 2002, in connection with the taxation of betting and related activities.  Subsection (2) provides for the repeal of sections 17(2) and (3) of the Finance Act 2009, relating to the rate of betting duty.  This provision was made in 2009 which allowed the Minister to increase the betting tax from 1% to 2%.  I am aware of the changes being proposed here and to which I have no objection.  However, I find it extraordinary that the Minister sees it necessary to repeal this subsection.  It is included as a precaution.  In the event of the new system not working, it would be easy for the Minister to increase the rate from 1% to 2%.With regard to betting tax in general, one of the most important industries outside of the cities and towns in this country is rural-based horse breeding and horse training.  It supplies a great number of jobs in areas where it is extremely difficult to get employment.  Regardless of whether we like it, the number of jobs is reducing.  A total of 85% of foals born in this country are exported so this is a valuable export industry in itself.  People will not breed horses unless there is a reasonable chance of a reasonable return in prize money when the horse is put to race.  Horse Racing Ireland does not have the money to give to prize money or to provide any other grants for improving conditions at race tracks or at dog tracks in the case of the greyhound industry.  Both industries are vitally important.When Fine Gael went into Government in 1982, betting tax was 20%.  In his first budget, Alan Dukes reduced the tax to 10%.  Over the past number of months and years, we have heard whingeing from bookmakers about a 1% or a 2% levy.  We cannot expect the taxpayer to fund racing and those involved in the industry do not want the taxpayer to have to fund it.  I enjoy a bet from time to time and I have no problem paying 2% tax on my bet.  For every €100 bet, I will pay €2 and 20 cent for every €10 bet.  Kids will not pick up a 20 cent coin off the street nowadays and yet we are allowing an industry to collapse.  We are fussing around with bookmakers who are complaining, the Paddy Powers and the Ladbrokes of this world.  They go on about the jobs they are creating but they forget about the jobs being lost.I appeal to the Minister not to include this provision as there is no reason to repeal that subsection.  It should be left in the Bill in the event that a future Minister may think it necessary to increase the rate from 1% to 2%.  I ask the Minister, not from a party political stand point but in the event of helping the industry as a whole, to leave the tax alone.  If the new provisions do not work then there is a fall back to increase the rate from 1% to 2%.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the senior Minister to agree to delete this provision on Report Stage if not now and to allow the rate stand.  I welcome the efforts being made by all concerned, including those in the Department of Finance, to deal with offshore betting and the attempt to deal with the exchange betting.  Great efforts have been made and I congratulate those involved.We must ensure that an important national industry does not fall by the wayside like it has in other countries.  It should be borne in mind that Ireland and Britain are among the few countries with off-course bookmakers.  All other countries depend on funding racing and the greyhound industry through Tote betting.  I have no vested interest other than to see an industry thriving as it is a great flagship industry for the country.  Ireland is renowned for its horses and nothing should be done to damage that industry.  This provision is completely unnecessary, in my view.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I concur with much of what Deputy Barrett has said.  Almost 30,000 people are employed on a full-time or part-time basis in various sectors of the horse and greyhound industry.  I regret the complete shambles made of the arrangements over the past 13 years by Fianna Fáil and its various Government partners.  We saw a parade of different vested interests all looking for an angle, all promising to deliver a high-quality product.  One of the reasons many people from other countries come to Ireland is because of their interest in racing and horses.  I refer to a regrettable result of the collapse of the boom which attracts media coverage.  At the edges of my constituency, in Dunsink, horses, mostly palominos, are running wild.  Many of them were starving during the cold spell.  People may have bought a couple of horses and had them in training or in a field or paddock and now that the construction industry has collapsed some of these horses have been left almost to fend for themselves.  It is not good in a country with a long reputation in the horse industry.  People who emigrated from Ireland over the past century and a half and their descendants have been heavily involved in horse racing and breeding in countries to which Irish people traditionally emigrated such as the United States and Australia.  The mess we have the moment is a reflection on the fact that Fianna Fáil in government caved in to vested interests with no clear insight as to what was best for the long-term future of the industry.My perspective is that the earlier model was more attractive, with a number of tracks for horses and greyhounds throughout the country where people can go, as opposed to being bent over a computer screen consumed by the type of gambling which has a very high risk of addiction.  There is potential for much money to be contributed to the national purse and ploughed back into the industry if we can get this right.I have seen some of the Independent Deputies lobbying heavily for slot machine casinos in Ireland.  The last proposal for a slot machine casino was in my constituency on the edge of the Phoenix Park, at the old Phoenix Park racecourse which had many deficiencies, as I am sure Deputy Barrett would have known.  However, it was a wonderful tourism amenity for the Dublin area.  The proposal collapsed and it never happened because it was for a casino with 1,600 slot machines.  I want to say to people who are being persuaded that the best thing for Ireland when we are on our knees is that we have Las Vegas style slot machine casinos, that they would wipe out most of our horse racing industry and do the same to our greyhound industry.I am probably one of the few Deputies in the House who worked in Atlantic City when I was a student.  Unfortunately, people who go to slot machines are not James Bond in a dickie bow going to play blackjack or cards at a table in a casino.  I have no problem with this type of operation where most of the people have quite a lot of money.  However, I certainly do not want to see pensioners and people on social welfare incomes being shipped by bus to slot machine venues where they are relieved of much of their meagre income.  In the United States a huge body of work is being done on the slot machine casino industry in areas of land and reserves owned by Native Americans.  In South Africa at the time of apartheid, bantustans and areas such as Swaziland and Lesotho were used as venues for slot machine casinos.  This is a personal view of mine and I know other views are held in the House.In the Fingal County Council area in north County Dublin, where I was a local authority member, and in Dublin city long campaigns were fought, certainly by Labour Party politicians, to get rid of slot machines and slot machine arcades where much gambling was occurring, which was very damaging, particularly to young people and those with an addiction to gambling.  People are holding up slot machine casinos as a way to save Ireland.  This is a trap and we would live to regret the social impact on society.  A day out at the races or a night at the dogs is a great and enjoyable experience and very attractive to visitors.  We should think about how best to encourage and promote this as part of an overall development of leisure amenities and tourism in this country and leave the mega slot machine casinos.  Anyone who has ever worked in a casino environment will realise that a casino with 1,500 slot machines is the size of three very large supermarkets.  It is a gigantic undertaking and one would need very large bus loads of people who are very often on very low incomes to feed the machines.  That is how it works.

When he corrected the figure it showed the scale of the change in the price of diesel and petrol in the past year alone.  This has a specific consequence for small businesses in particular and those living in rural Ireland.  Those living in larger cities have a public transport network and I will come back to this. However, in huge tracts of Ireland people are totally dependent on motorised vehicles.  Small businesses trying to export our goods are also dependent on trucks and vans to shuttle their goods around the country to ports.  The biggest problem is that the public transport network and the train network have been reduced and undermined in recent years by a lack of proper investment.  An alternative is not there for many small businesses dependent on motorised transport.This is a very penal tax increase and it should be resisted in every way.  I am not one to encourage more and more cars in the street.  However, in this city the Government has reduced the subvention to the public transport networks in recent times.  So much for the Green Party and its endorsement of public transport.  Years of underfunding have meant that even in this city where one would expect public transport to be the most effective and efficient for everyone to use, it has not delivered and it has not been delivered upon by the Government.Small businesses have already been screwed by the Government because additional taxes have made it more difficult for them, as have the lack of credit from the banks and the rates increases from local authorities.  I do not blame local authorities.  The problem with local authorities is that over the years the Government has underfunded local authorities so their only recourse in many ways is to further tax local businesses and shops.I urge that this Bill be totally rejected.  The only part of it which I support — but which should not be there — is the reduction in the travel tax.  If we are to build Ireland the travel tax should be removed altogether.  There should have been an opportunity to remove that tax altogether.On a point of order, I ask that a quorum be called.Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13930	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I would be happy to get any seat at all, myself.I wish to speak to section 46 and in particular the betting duties.  Section 46(2) provides for the repeal of sections 17(2) and 17(3) of the Finance Act 2009 relating to the rate of betting duty.  I do not understand why the Minister is seeking to repeal these sections.  The Labour Party through its former spokesperson, Deputy Upton, published a very comprehensive paper entitled Raising the Stakes, in which she established a formula that would allow for a greater degree of online capture.  Mr. Kavanagh from Horse Racing Ireland gave a comprehensive overview on the state of play at today's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  His overview referred to a fourth consecutive cut to the horse and greyhound racing fund which has fallen from €76 million in 2008 to €57.2 million in 2011 and that this was not a sustainable position from which to develop a key industry.Across the political divide we have as a common cause the interests of the horseracing and greyhound racing industries.  However, we must ensure the provisions at paragraphs (f), (e), (d) and (a) stand up to scrutiny.  I do not understand why the Government is not going after the online capture.  I would like further clarification as to how these provisions will translate in real terms.  I do not understand why the taxpayer through the Exchequer should continue to fund the industry directly through the provision of prize money.  We all understand it is an extensive industry and support the aims of Horse Racing Ireland, but we must ensure tax is captured from the punter and anybody who makes a bet whether it is online or through bookies offices on-street.I speak for people like Mrs. Bambury in Mallow, who is a second-generation bookmaker but who does not have an online presence.  The levy is being collected and yet there are bookmakers in Mallow — which has its own racecourse — which have an on-street and online presence also.  There is a disparity between the collection from the on-street presence and the lack of a collection from the online presence.  We should go after the online betting and we need to go after the exchanges.  It is disingenuous for certain celebrities to push the exchanges as being somehow very egalitarian in their outlook.  Our interpretation is that, by their very nature, the exchanges will pay out the prize money, which is fair enough.  However, it will be the Exchequer — the taxpayer — which pays the prize money at the racing stadia and so on.  We need to introduce a level playing pitch here.  I am not clear as to the various paragraphs.  We need a proper analysis.  Perhaps we should look at the French model in terms of collection.  The submission by Mr. Kavanagh to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was an in-depth one and there was an actual willingness on the part of Horse Racing Ireland to engage on the issue of capturing more revenue through more imaginative means.  I ask for a response to that point from the Minister of State.I am conscious of time.  HRI made a presentation to the committee today.  There are 9,530 registered breeders in Ireland, some 15% are overseas investors and 92% own fewer than five mares.  There were 416 stallions at stud in 2008, of which 362 stood for a fee of €7,000 or less.  We must support the industry but we must also ensure that such support does not militate against the taxpayer.  The industry must find more imaginative ways to fund the prize money henceforth.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I agree with the sentiments of Deputy Sherlock regarding Horse Racing Ireland.  I understand it has been proposed to set the licence for online betting at €5,000.  There is a danger this licence may facilitate cowboy online bookmakers from abroad who would come to and register in this country and signal on their websites they were registered and approved by the Irish system.  There is a danger of fraud being committed by Internet cowboy bookmakers who would do damage to Ireland's reputation.  Perhaps we should consider increasing that fee to €30,000 or €40,000, which would deter such bookmakers.  Those in the country who work under the licence in good faith would not have any difficulty in paying that, as I understand it.  We should consider increasing the €5,000 licence fee which would discourage the online cowboy bookmakers.

I was not present at the time but Deputy Barrett asked about the 2% duty provision.  As I understand it, this is regarded as not required which is why it is being repealed.  However,  according to the answer provided to me, the opportunity of reintroducing it remains.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Nonsense.  I have a point of order.  I appreciate the Minister of State was not present but my point was that this measure was introduced in 2009, giving the Minister power, by order, to increase the duty if he or she wishes.  It should be left there and left alone.  There is no reason to take it away or say it is not necessary.  Who knows whether it may not be necessary in a year's time?

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The predominant part of the discussion since I came into the Chamber has concerned how to capture the online sector.  As all of us know there is no doubt this sector has grown very dramatically in recent times.  It is a very difficult area to capture.  Obviously, provisions and arrangements will  be made by regulation.  We all accept that a regulatory framework must be put in place which will deal with betting exchanges and remote or online betting.  I did not entirely understand the point made by Deputy Burton.  As her colleague, Deputy Sherlock, pointed out, racing is a very important part of the economy, a point often lost sight of in the debate.  Even a non-punter like me can see it is a critically important industry.The proposal in the Bill aimed to create a balance by extending a modest rate of 1% to online and telephone betting, thereby creating a levelling of the playing field notwithstanding the point made by Deputy Barrett.  That is the logic behind this section of the Bill.In reply to Deputy Andrews' concerns, obviously any form of change is open to exploitation by those who are willing to operate outside the law.  Again that is a matter for  regulation.Deputy Ó Snodaigh touched on remoter or wider parts of the Bill when he spoke of the differences in the excise duties on petrol and diesel.   It is an interesting point and I will reply to the Deputy through his colleagues.  Petrol is generally 7 cent cheaper per litre in the Republic than it is in Northern Ireland while the differential for diesel is 20 cent.  That is why there is such purchase of fuels in the South by people registered in the North.  The differential is so handsome that it pays certain people to operate outside the law and become involved in illegal activities, but I am sure no Member of the House has any such connection.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I move amendment No. 89:
In page 186, line 11, to delete "€3" and substitute "€2".This relates to the travel tax which my party proposed to scrap in its entirety in our alternative budget.The Minister has reduced the charge from €10 to €7 and we propose to reduce it further to €2 or zero, if the Minister would accept that.  The issue sends out the wrong message.  We know tourism figures are well down, with numbers down by a couple of hundred thousand in the past year.  That has a direct impact on many tourism providers, including those involved in accommodation, retail and amenities.  People are under serious pressure, having built up businesses on established tourist numbers.  They are falling away and nothing is being done to help these people; the opposite is occurring, which brings a direct cost on jobs and will put more people on dole queues.In our alternative budget we put it up to the airline industries, indicating that Michael O'Leary, Aer Lingus bosses and anybody else involved should put their money into a marketing campaign and match the resources of the State in this area in order to bring in clients.  If they can prove that the reduction of the tax will bring more people into this country, we will leave the tax at zero.  If they fail to do so the tax can be reinstated but they should be given the chance to prove that the Government is wrong on the issue.  These parties have been campaigning with an argument that the tax should not be in place, and we agree, but we challenge them to prove it.By keeping the tax, the wrong message will go out.  A person booking a flight online will see increased taxes, which will put him or her off and that person will go elsewhere.  The Minister seems to believe people do not choose where to fly based on price increases of €3 or €4 but they do.  When people pick a country to visit they can see the prices for flights so when taxes start building up they soon become disinterested and go elsewhere.  Tourists are voting with their feet and not coming to this country for many reasons, one of which we know is the travel tax.At this stage I ask the Government to consider reducing the figure.  We would prefer to see it gone altogether but we had to put down an amendment for the €2 figure.  The issue should be given some real thought as the message is wrong.  We are suffering in this country because of a lack of tourists and we can really grow the sector and create jobs.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Deputy English made a very coherent address outlining reasons for not having an airport travel tax.  I concur with everything he says because it sends out the wrong signal.  The amendment his party has put down relating to the tax sends out an equally wrong signal as the party does not propose to scrap it; the amendment proposes to keep the travel tax with a reduced rate of €2.  In my opening contribution to Committee Stage I argued that this is an act of political codology.  The Deputy said the party would prefer to see the tax scrapped.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	293	That is in our budget proposal.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	294	Yes but this is where we introduce aspects into law.  The budget proposals will not mean anything for Ryanair or Aer Lingus, and it will not change the signals to those who want to come to this country.  That will be affected by what we decide to introduce into legislation.  The amendment looks to put into legislation an airport travel tax of €2, which Fine Gael would secure if the Government accepted the amendment.The Deputy is correct in that it would send out the wrong signals to the tourist.  This is a sector with the potential to reach significant numbers of people and create jobs.  God above has provided assets for this country that we have not exploited properly, including our scenery, cultural tourism, language and the hospitality and good nature of Irish people.  We must tap into the goodwill within the Irish diaspora to help the country regain its position in the eyes of the world.  There is much potential in the tourism sector.  I will not focus any more on Fine Gael bar to say that if we are to have an election debate, we must be honest with people.  There is no point saying that the airport tax will be scrapped while at the same time introducing an amendment fixing a €2 rate.The Minister's reduction of the rate to €3 does not go far enough.  We should be clear that the airport travel tax should be scrapped, as this would not just be revenue neutral but would benefit the Exchequer because of an increased tourist flow to the State.  It must be acknowledged that the amendment presented by the Government is an acknowledgement that introducing a travel tax of €10 was wrong.  This is acknowledged through the amendment put before the House.The Government may not be in a position next year to introduce a budget to correct the wrongs of this budget.  Just as it was wrong to introduce a €10 charge, which is being acknowledged in the amendment, it is equally wrong to introduce the €3 charge.  I know, coming from the north west, the impact of the downturn of the numbers of tourists coming to the region.  Other measures in the Finance Bill relate to increases in petrol and diesel, which were dealt with in section 39, but we must look at the Finance Bill as a unified piece of legislation.  All these measures have an impact on tourists.

One could reasonably ask what difference €3 will make.  People travelling from Boston, New York, Australia, Shanghai or New York would pay an extra €3 but their holiday will cost hundreds of euro at the very least.  The cost may be in the thousands of euro if families come along.  One can add the costs of increased excise and taxes.  A person coming to Donegal cannot jump on the train so a car must be hired and filled at the petrol station.  That person must pay the excise duties, with the rates being increased by the Government in this budget.  The person will also pay the additional airport tax.  The signal is that this place is closed for tourism purposes.The reduction of the rate does not go far enough as we must put a stop to the signal that this place penalises tourists.  This may have more to do with supporting the 100,000 people who will leave our shores in the next two years; they will have to pay €7 less.  It is the wrong decision and the tax should be repealed.  The section should be replaced with a section deleting the airport tax in its totality.

I listened to him and am now replying.  Sinn Féin has no amendment dealing with the imposition of a travel tax and Fine Gael has tabled an amendment reducing the tax.  We would prefer if the tax was at zero but we are also realists in so far as the State must collect revenue.  We have produced a budget based on the fact that the Government is retaining a €3 travel tax.  To show our disdain for the idea of a travel tax in the first place we put down an amendment in order to debate the issue, which is more than Sinn Féin has done.Sinn Féin should stop at every possible opportunity looking to introduce party politics into every amendment.  It is criticising either the Labour Party or Fine Gael on every occasion.  It has made the point that it does not believe in increasing taxes but it wants to increase expenditure.  It has not indicated how everything will balance so we accept that the party lives in a fairyland.  It should not spend its time criticising a party putting down an amendment to reduce the proposed tax when it has nothing to contribute.As my colleague, Deputy English, has said, as an island nation it is crazy to impose any travel tax.  We must encourage people into and out of this country.  If they are travelling here on holiday, they must return home.  It is beyond belief that we would impose a tax on travel when we want to create jobs and the tourism industry is crumbling.  Any hotelier, publican or guesthouse owner will tell one what is happening in the tourism sector.  We should do everything possible to boost tourism and create jobs.  We should not have taxes which discourage people from visiting this country.I ask Deputies to support the Fine Gael Party amendment and ensure the air travel tax is progressively abolished.  While the composition of any new Government is a matter for the electorate, I hope the new Administration will abolish the tax at the first opportunity.  In the meantime, the amendment reinforces the argument that Ireland does not need a travel tax when tourism numbers are in decline, the tourism sector is on its knees and hotels are closing.  It makes sense to avail of every opportunity to use tourism to ensure there are better days ahead.

At a time of great economic crisis and high unemployment Governments must be careful about the taxes they introduce.  Unfortunately, the air travel tax was exactly the type of tax we did not need at an extraordinarily sensitive time for the tourism industry.  While the reduction is welcome, the Government could have gone a little further.  The challenge for the various operators in the tourism industry is to show that the reduction will produce a flow of visitors.One factor which would help Ireland to recover would be a return to traditional and basic industries such as tourism, rather than construction and property development.  Despite the many reductions in wages and salaries, Ireland remains an expensive country in which to live.  Its high cost of living was the cause of upward pressure on wages.  Hotels and other elements of the tourism industry are trying to give good value for money.  This is a welcome development because we must bear in mind that other countries are competing strongly.  For instance, for a considerable part of last year's off-season, Spain offered extremely attractive packages to tourists aged 55 years and over.  Reports indicate that the attractive hotel rates that were made available in regional and tourist resort hotels in Spain last year were very popular with retired Irish people.A new Government will have to focus on developing a policy to show that Ireland as a tourist destination is not only attractive but very good value for money.  We do not want visitors from continental Europe, the United Kingdom or the United States being shocked at the costs they encounter when they arrive.  We need to develop package programmes which ensure tourists, particularly those of average means, are well advised of what will be the likely cost of a good holiday, whether long or short.  An all-in package approach would, I hope, help reinvigorate our traditional markets, namely, the United Kingdom and United States.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The rates of tax applied by the countries to which I refer are higher than the Irish rate, in some cases substantially so.  The trend in Europe is towards applying a tax on air travel.  Calls have been made to abolish the tax on the basis that it adversely affects the number of people travelling to Ireland.  The Minister has difficulty accepting this proposition and considers that the impact of the air travel tax has been overstated.  The numbers travelling appear to be more closely related to other factors, including the level of economic activity.  Notwithstanding these reservations, the Minister decided that a single, revised rate of air travel tax of €3 will come into effect on 1 March.  He indicated that the reduction announced in the budget should only apply on a temporary basis and that the rate would be increased unless there is clear and decisive evidence of an appropriate response from the airlines to increasing capacity and numbers travelling to Ireland by air.  He was pleased his budget announcement was supplemented by an incentive scheme introduced by the Dublin Airport Authority for a full rebate of airport charges for additional traffic delivered above a certain threshold based on 2010 passenger numbers.A modest air tax of €3 will yield close to €35 million in a full year.  The case for reducing the tax further does not stand up, particularly as we are undergoing fiscal pressures and there is a requirement that the tax system be viewed as fair.  The reduction in the air travel tax was a significant concession.  The correct approach is to wait to see whether passenger numbers increase on foot of the change.  In that regard, the cost of enhancing the concession further would be more than €10 million.  In that context, the amendment is not accepted.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I move amendment No. 90a:In page 196, before section 52, to insert the following new section:"PART 3Information on Tax Exiles52.—The Minister shall within one month from the passing of this Act prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the contribution made to the Exchequer and in particular the contribution in that regard as a result of the measures introduced by the Finance Act 2010.".The purpose of this amendment is to restate the position of the Labour Party on this issue.  Significant numbers of people — the Revenue Commissioners suggest the figure is between 2,000 and 3,000 — are tax exiles from this country but, although technically not resident for tax purposes, they have the ability to come in and out of the country at frequent intervals, have homes here and, to all intents and purposes, live large parts of their lives here.  Such people should make a contribution in this time of national economic emergency.When the Minister presented the 2010 budget in December 2009, he announced that he would ensure a contribution was made to the country's coffers by non-resident tax exiles.  However, while people in the PAYE sector and in business ended up paying their increased taxes almost immediately, nothing has happened yet in this regard.  The Minister introduced the universal social charge in his budget speech early in December of last year, and those with private and public pensions were shocked when they opened their pension cheques this year and found that even those with medical cards, who had previously been exempt from such charges, and those with pensions of less than €26,000 — that is, most public service and private pensioners — were paying the new universal social charge at the top rate of 7% on their relatively small pensions.On big days in this 30th Dáil, as more and more emergency measures were introduced and as the coffers of the State were being plundered for money to hand over to the banks, there was a phrase that Fianna Fáil Deputies were particularly fond of using, namely, "We are all in this together".  Surprise, surprise: we are not all in it together.  The people who have the use of clever tax advisers and accountants and who have offshore and onshore residences have been able, during the boom years, to be resident in the country but not resident for tax purposes.  Following a campaign by the Labour Party, which I spoke about many times on the floor of the House, it was agreed that tax exiles should contribute to the Exchequer.  The Minister said in his Budget Statement in December 2009 that he would make provision for this in 2010.  When I asked questions about it, I was told that no information would be available until October 2010, and when October 2010 came, I was told "Sorry — we actually meant October 2011".  This is in contrast to the people who opened cheques this month to find they were paying the new tax, the universal social charge, at fairly hefty levels from 1 January, having heard about it only in December of last year.I ask the Minister for Finance and Fianna Fáil to agree to this modest amendment, which is phrased the way it is in order to be acceptable under the rules of a money Bill, under which it is impossible for the Opposition to table amendments that result in changes upwards or downwards in the taxation system.  It is impossible for the Opposition to table motions that result in changes upwards or downwards in the taxation system.  We want to have the report one month after this Act, because it is important, particularly for people in the PAYE sector, to know what the Fianna Fáil mantra, "we're all in this together", actually means.One thing that has been most striking for Deputies on all sides of the House was the position of the self-employed in the construction industry, whether contractors, sub-contractors or ordinary workers, when the boom collapsed.  Although they had been paying PRSI contributions and relevant contracts tax, RCT, where tax was being deducted at source in the case of contractors, once they lost their jobs and money, they could not claim unemployment benefit.  Think of all the sub-contractors on the Pierse contract for the building of schools who found they could not be paid except by the liquidator, who had no money, even though this was a State-initiated PPP.  They might have had a claim to job seeker's allowance but not to job seeker's benefit.  However, if a spouse was working and earning a relatively modest amount, because the job seeker's allowance is means tested, this meant in many cases that the unemployed partner had no claim to that either.  Very hard working self-employed people around the country, who, despite their businesses failing, made contributions, but have no entitlement to any type of State support.  This is a major social issue all over Ireland.  Remember that many tax exiles who have made fortunes in development and construction moved themselves and their wives offshore to facilitate tax planning and then came back to Ireland.  Now look at the small people who are self-employed and how badly many of them have fared.I recommend the Minister accepts that this report should be put before the House.  The cost would be minimal, but it would give us the numbers of non-resident tax exiles and the parameters regarding the contributions the Minister for Finance believes it is reasonable they should make.  I commend the amendment to the House on behalf of the Labour Party.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I welcome this amendment tabled by Deputy Burton and the Labour Party.  As she rightly says, a Finance Bill, while it deals with income and expenditure and sets out a tax code for the full administrative year, is probably the only vehicle through which Members of the House can seek from the Minister and the Department of Finance a report on issues of concern that arise from time to time within the tax code.No doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, is aware from his constituents in Tipperary South that the matter Deputy Burton raised is an issue of genuine concern.  Despite the minimal changes that have occurred in recent years, there is a necessity for a comprehensive report, as Deputy Burton has said, to be able to reassure compliant taxpayers, the PAYE sector in particular, that there is fairness in terms of how these individuals are treated, what their status is, the length of time they stay in this country and the parameters around that.  It is inherently right to insert this amendment in the context of this Bill to allow for that report.  Even if the Minister was to assure the House that while it might not be possible in the context of this Bill but at some time in the near future a report would be issued by his Department along the lines suggested by Deputy Burton, some good could come from that.The changes announced by the Minister for Finance on 7 December, the changes on budget night and those being enacted in this legislation have a dramatic effect on ordinary people, particularly those on low means.  We know the consequences of the new social charge in respect of taxpayers on incomes of €4,000 or more now in the net, despite the amendments announced yesterday.  The most obvious unfairness, irrespective of the failure to index tax credits, is that there is now a marginal rate for taxpayers on an income of €32,000.  Once an income reaches €32,000, a person is paying the top rate of tax, along with the 7% and 4% social charge, effectively bringing the top marginal rate to 52%.  Having had a period over many years when tax was relatively low, we are rapidly moving to a very high marginal rate.  It is a difficult situation, where incomes are being slashed and in many instances where people are on part-time or no longer able to access overtime.  They are also being affected by a very high new marginal rate of tax of the order of 52%.  It is within that context that this debate is being framed.People know the scale of the adjustment that has to occur in this country over the next few years to bring Ireland back to some form of economic stability.  People are prepared, albeit in difficult circumstances, to make the adjustments in terms of their household income and in terms of the income that exists within this society.  However, what they want to see throughout is a fundamental principle of fairness.  People will do the heavy lifting in respect of the adjustments that have to occur if they believe that those at the top, in particular, are shouldering the burden and are prepared to make a contribution over and above ordinary and lower income taxpayers.  We have an unusual situation, a type of "flight of the earls" in which people enter and leave this country, being treated as some type of high-bred class in terms of their tax status.  That we allow such a situation to exist within the tax code adds to sense of unfairness that has to be tackled, so I very much support the amendment.I am all ears to hear from the Minister of State, in the event that it cannot be done in the context of the Bill, why this might be the case.  However, we have to be aware of this issue if we are asking people on relatively small means to do much of the heavy lifting in this economy over the course of the next few years.  The tax code has got to be and must be seen to be fair to all.

It is interesting that an amendment must be tabled in this way, asking for a report to be laid before the House, in order to deal with the issue of tax exiles.  A practical amendment could be lifted and accepted by the Government.  In saying that, I magnify two aspects that are wrong with this House.  One must invoke ingenuity in order to get around the rules of the House.  If one manages to do so, the Government will not accept the amendment because of a convention in the House.  In the time I have been here, the Government has accepted two or three amendments from the Opposition.  This is telling.  It says it all about how this place operates.  It is crazy.Millionaires and billionaires are avoiding paying tax while those on the new minimum wage are caught to some degree by the universal social charge.  People are swanning around, not paying their fair share.  The Government ignored suggestions in the Sinn Féin pre-budget submission, which sought a fair taxation system and a new tax band of 48% on those earning in excess of €100,000.  This only covered that portion of individuals' income but was ignored by the Government.  The other important element of the submission was to introduce a wealth tax.  This amounts only to 1% and concerns wealth in excess of €1 million.  There was an income-related context so that a pensioner living in a little cottage in Ballsbridge, which could be worth substantially in excess of €1 million——

We have outlined that in terms of capping salaries of €100,000 and dealing with the pay of Ministers and Oireachtas Members.  People ignored what we were proposing.  Let us call the adjustments cuts.It would be interesting if the Government accepts this amendment.  Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle can advise on the following matter.  Will this be invoked one month after the passing of the Bill?  Does that mean that the Dáil will not be sitting by then?  I am sure there is provision for this somewhere.

The difficulty about it is that, in this sense, we are not an island and the greater the wealth, the greater the mobility.  One only has to read the press across the water for debates that reach into politics, where treasurers of parties are involved in non-domiciled rules.  I do not propose to accept the amendments but for the following reasons.  The report proposed by Deputy Burton is clearly a report on the contribution to the Exchequer made by so-called tax exiles.  The Minister has stated on previous occasions that he is informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no one register or list of so-called tax exiles and nothing in Irish law thus far makes reference to tax exile status.The taxation of individuals in the State is in line with that prevailing in most OECD jurisdictions.  Individuals who are not resident for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in this State.  They pay tax on income arising in the State and from income derived from working here.  Many individuals — I am not saying most or all — who declare on tax returns that they are non-resident in this State do not have an Irish address.  Many of these non-residents are foreign nationals or have a foreign domicile and many non-resident Irish citizens or Irish domiciliaries included in this figure may have become non-resident for reasons unrelated to taxation but may have retained Irish investments such as rental property.  Individuals leaving the State are not required to give reasons for leaving.  In other words, it is not true to say that 6,000 individuals, or whatever number is suggested, are tax exiles.  Some non-residents have an Irish tax liability but it is not true to say that all or most of them are Irish domiciled individuals who have moved out of Ireland for tax reasons.  As there is no definition of tax exile in Irish law, nor any way of determining how many non-resident taxpayers are non-resident for tax reasons, it is difficult to prepare a report on the subject.In referring to the measures introduced in their Finance Act 2010, the Deputy is presumably referring to the domicile levy charged on an individual Irish domiciled and an Irish citizen whose worldwide income exceeds €1 million, whose Irish located property is greater than €5 million and whose liability to Irish income tax is less than €200,000.Incidentally, in the previous year's Finance Act, the Minister abolished the Cinderella rule.  This was originally introduced when the Labour Party was part of the Government.  Before the abolition, an individual could be present in the State for most or practically all of the day, provided he or she left just before midnight.  Hence the name Cinderella.

The current rules state that an individual can be present in the State for 182 days or less and still be non-resident.  As it is difficult to estimate the number of individuals who satisfy this criteria, it is not possible to predict the number of individuals subject to the levy or the likely yield from the measure.  This is the reason for regarding the amendment as premature.  The first payment date for the domicile levy, as Deputy Burton correctly pointed out, is 31 October 2011 in respect of the 2010 tax year.  Once there is a yield from the levy, it would be more sensible to prepare a report on the subject.  Whether I am in the House, I shall look forward to it with interest and anticipation.  This point has been much discussed in the House and in the relevant committee.  I look forward to how the next Government will deal with this subject.

If she is elected to this House, it will be a first for this House to have a Member who was a professional midwife of long standing and who would have such experience of the health services.The Minister of State said it all in one, namely, that if the first contributions from the arrangements entered into in last year's Finance Act and announced in 2009 produce a contribution, it will only come in, as it were, in October 2011.  For the many people absolutely astonished by the rigour and level of the universal social charge, they basically got about three weeks' notice of it and bearing in mind that notice period included Christmas and all the bad weather at that time, it is no wonder people did not necessarily spot it in the budget coverage.I was involved in a debate here on budget night with the former Minister, Deputy Harney, and I raised with her the issue of medical card holders having to pay the new universal social charge.  If I recall correctly, she stressed that it was the policy of the Government to decouple the whole issue of taxation and medical cards.  People who were setting out the policy did not have regard to the level of contribution required by people in quite poor economic circumstances and they were going to proceed with the measure, partly because of the IMF.  This is one of the problems with the Irish taxation system.  The former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, has spoken about it on a number of occasions.  The Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil would disagree on many tax issues and on the effectiveness and fairness of taxation.We have a hollowed out tax system in respect of which use is made of an enormous variety of loopholes and contrivances and tax advisers are used across a wide range of taxes.  There are people with significant wealth, influence and power whose view of taxation in terms of a contribution is "We will not pay a cent".  We do not have, as there is in other countries, an ethos whereby one makes a contribution, even if one is very wealthy and such a person does not use his or her wealth status to avoid making a contribution.  It is not enough for somebody who has become very wealthy and who is very successful in business to say that his or her success in business — which is celebrated — involves him or her providing employment for people, even though that is welcome.  Many multimillionaires and billionaires are to be congratulated on their success and good fortune.  In some cases some of them inherited their wealth.  They just happened to be born in the right spot with the right name, but in many cases people are substantially self-made or have made fortunes built on more modest amounts of money that their parents may have left them.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Such people cannot simply avoid making their fair contribution.  If reform in this area is to be introduced by the next Government, it will be difficult because these are very powerful people, with vested interests and they employ the best lawyers in the world.  We have to get everyone in this country contributing at an effective rate.  That is the only way we will keep taxes low and moderate, which is what we need.  We must get everyone to contribute.It is regrettable that for seven or eight years Fianna Fáil — going back to the time of Charlie McCreevy, moving on to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, and now the current Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan —  has ducked and dived on this issue.  I think it was I who coined the term the Cinderella clause in terms of midnight, which has become part of taxation language.  When the Cinderella clause came in approximately 18 years ago, based on a British clause, most very wealthy people in Ireland then did not have personal helicopters to take a little ride out over Lambay island or Howth Head out of the jurisdiction for a couple of hours and then hop back again.  What we need, and I hope it may emerge in the coming election, is a consensus from all the parties that even people of great power, wealth and influence — who are widely and correctly admired by many and many of whom I know are very charitable — must contribute their fair share.  I ask the House to support the Labour Party amendment.

I am interested in hearing from the Minister of State the rationale on the question of consecutive days.  This section which is an amendment to the principal Act substitutes 28 consecutive days for seven consecutive days and I want to hear from the Minister of State the purpose of that in respect of this amendment of the principal Act.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I do not propose to accept this amendment.  Section 53 of the Bill amends section 17 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 to extend the notification requirements on foreign-based mobile traders, namely persons not established in the State supplying goods for consideration in the State.Section 17 provides that where a premises provider allows a foreign-based mobile trader to supply goods for consideration on his or her land for a period of less than seven consecutive days, the premises provider must notify Revenue of the mobile trader, and this notification must be made 14 days in advance of when the trading takes place.  This arrangement informs Revenue that the mobile traders are trading in the State and Revenue can then visit these premises to ensure tax possibly due by these foreign-based traders is returned and paid to the Exchequer.  Currently, there is no obligation on premises providers to make such advance notification to Revenue if the mobile trader trades in goods for periods in excess of seven days.The stipulation on seven days is now considered to be too restrictive, particularly in reference to the types of events, now more commonplace and occurring nationwide, but lasting for periods in excess of seven days, such as boat races, fairs, Christmas markets etc.  Some of these events have up to 70 stalls and many traders are from mainland Europe, but not established here.Section 53 amends section 17 to provide that the period of trading by a foreign mobile trader, which would require a premises provider to make advance notification to Revenue, is being extended from seven days to 28 days.  I would just clarify that the period provided for notification by premises providers, currently 14 days, is not being amended by section 53.This amendment is an anti-evasion measure to ensure that Revenue is aware of various different events happening countrywide, lasting up to 28 days.  The information is received in the various Revenue districts and compliance officers are then sent out to visit these premises to ensure tax properly due by these foreign-based mobile traders is returned and paid to the Exchequer.I repeat, this amendment will assist in combating tax evasion by foreign-based mobile traders.  Perhaps in the light of that explanation, the Deputy opposite might consider withdrawing the amendment.

Is the notification period to be extended?  That would seem sensible enough as a means of making it clear to the authorities that a certain trader is coming such that they could ensure they have the wherewithal to deal with the matter.  However, in doing that, would conditions be made more restrictive for traders entering the country?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Is this section an amendment to the principal Act in respect of the application of VAT to immovable goods provided by public bodies?  I presume the measure extends VAT to local authorities' goods and services in respect of which no VAT applied heretofore.  The Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong.  It is an important issue.The section deals with the capital goods scheme.  In amending the principal Act, have the Revenue Commissioners and the Department assessed the likely financial imposition of the proposal on public bodies?  I am aware of a case in my local authority area in respect of which VAT is deemed to apply based on decisions of the European courts.  I am not exactly certain that the legislation applies in this instance.  I am interested in hearing the rationale for the change the Minister of State is proposing to make to the principal Act.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	359	This section amends section 95 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act, which deals with transitional arrangements relating to deductibility for housing and burial plots sold by public bodies that have been subject to VAT from 1 July 2010.  The amendment provides for a deductibility adjustment, which is to be no greater than the amount of VAT due on the sale, for housing and burial plots sold by public bodies on or after 1 July 2010 which were required or developed by them before that date and where there is otherwise no entitlement to VAT input credit.Since 1 July 2010, the deductibility adjustment has been provided administratively pending the necessary amending legislation.  If I understand the section correctly, it is less an imposition and more a relief for public bodies.  Sometimes, if one does not have one side, one cannot claim it on the other.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The first part of section 57 deals with the exemption from VAT of public postal services provided as part of the universal service set out in the EU postal directives.  It extends this both to An Post and any other designated provider of that service.  I presume this means postage stamps will remain free of VAT, in addition to postal services, be they the traditional services provided by An Post or those provided by new providers that may be competing in the deregulated market.As we come to the end of the life of the 30th Dáil, it is appropriate to state on the record that very many postal workers, bus drivers and other drivers in various public services did a lot to help those who would otherwise have been very isolated and alone during the recent cold spell.  In the rush to deregulate postal services and amend or lose the universal postal service, this assistance should be noted.  In a country like Ireland, which has a large number of roads and some very isolated housing, the services of postmen and postwomen are really valued.  Their services comprise an important part of the fabric of the State, particularly in rural areas.Now that there are many changes and a collapse in banking, it may well be that instead of having large numbers of banks in Ireland, particularly in smaller towns and some villages, there will be but one large Irish bank.  A bank comprises a very important part of community services, particularly for those in isolated areas and those on low incomes.I welcome the confirmation that cultural services are to remain exempt from VAT.  I am sure the Minister of State must have been influential in that regard.  The exemption is to apply to charges such as those to enter museums and stately homes.  It is helpful that there is confirmation in this regard.  The measure helps to keep prices competitive, both for the Irish and tourists from abroad.  Last year, following an EU court case, local authorities had to charge VAT on services provided.  I welcome the recognition of organisations such as museums.  It allows them to continue to apply the VAT exemption to their services.

As she pointed out, the service is particularly valuable in rural areas, where on weekdays one can predict within an hour the time of arrival of a postman.  Despite the discussions, debates and rationalisation attempts of the past 20 years, the service to the door continues in the majority of cases.  Long may it do so.I will confirm explicitly that stamps are free from VAT.  I take a certain interest in stamps, having been for many years a member of the philatelic advisory committee.  I welcome that the standard internal post rate of 55 cent has been maintained for many years.

As we know, all of the principal cultural institutions and many of the buildings run by the Office of Public Works are free of entry charges.  Some places have an entry charge where it acts as a rationing mechanism or there is a high level of foreign visits.  Even in museums and galleries, there tends to be a charge on special exhibitions to make them financially viable.  Our existing policy, which has lasted for many years, is essentially a good one.

During the past four or five years, various Ministers have often referred to our smart economy and the importance of its continued development.  One imagines we would be encouraging the people in question to be innovative and to develop their entrepreneurial endeavours.  As such, the abolition of this relief is a serious retrograde step in respect of the many small people who have tried to develop indigenous industries, particularly in the current climate.  I fully accept that many of the big people, as it were, abused the system to some degree.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	378	No, but the situation is serious and I ask the Minister of State to redress it.  Many people have been innovative because of the incentives provided up to a maximum of €5 million.  Most of our small industries, particularly outside the major urban areas and industrial centres, benefited from the support provided through these incentives.The Government repeatedly discussed the smart economy, but how can we reconcile the abolition of the relief with the considerable support that the Government is providing to research and development at third level?  People who are trying to develop enterprises outside third level institutions and on their own initiative are being penalised.  Will the Minister of State re-examine this issue and reduce the relief in such a way as to eliminate those who were abusing it?  Instead of a complete abolition, the relief could be reduced by half or even 33%.  There is no point in throwing the baby out with the bath water.  It would be an iron-fisted response.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could inform the House about the saving that will accrue from the abolition of the relief and about whether a cost benefit analysis has been carried out.We sell ourselves as trying to encourage foreign companies to come to Ireland and the consequential research and development, particularly in University College Galway, where outstanding and innovative work has been done.  Galway has become a hub for medical devices.  Despite the fact that money is being pumped into research and development at third level, will such work now be de-incentivised?  Reconciling the abolition of the relief with where we want to go is difficult.This might be my last opportunity to contribute in the House.  I would like to offer a sincere word of thanks to my colleagues, first and foremost those in Galway East, and to wish those who are retiring well, those being, Deputies Connaughton and Treacy.  In particular, I wish Deputy Treacy, who stated yesterday that he will not be going forward for re-election, a speedy return to health.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, for his outstanding work and the support he gave to the people severely affected by the recent flooding in east County Galway, be they in the Ballinasloe or Gort area.  Some doubted him, but he followed through on his assertion that he would take the lead role in driving relief forward.  I compliment him in this regard and hope that the work will continue to provide relief for the many people whose incomes and households suffered.It is regrettable that we cannot get many insurance companies to respond to the needs of people.  They have taken a heavy-handed approach by refusing people home insurance.  Those people will live in constant fear until such time as full remedial works have been carried out to prevent further flooding.I wish all candidates, particularly my colleagues, well in the forthcoming election.  Deputy Brian Hayes is a former student of mine, one of whom I am proud.  I wish him well, not only in this——

The question of special needs is important.  When legislation was introduced in the House, the only missing element related to the rights of people with special needs.  Sure enough, it turned out to be an important element.  It is regrettable that the rights to which they were entitled were seriously qualified by the availability of resources.  Many of the people we as public representatives encountered ten or 20 years ago have grown old.  Their greatest fear is the future facing themselves and their siblings.  It is a difficult future.  They campaigned to achieve even the basic entitlements and it was a long and difficult struggle.  It is regrettable that special needs children have to go without.  They are being put back into mainstream education and they will lose out substantially and their future lives will be restricted as a result.There are many other issues I would like to have seen addressed.  I greatly appreciate the Acting Chairman's flexibility with regard to time.  We must accept there are so many fine people in the public service and in the Civil Service who are never recognised for their true worth and the work they do for the community and for the services provided by Departments.  Their positive response on all occasions to our representations has been wonderful.  I pay tribute to them all.

However, I will convey the Deputy's comments to the Minister.  I thank him for his camaraderie in the Seanad and the Dáil.  I deeply appreciate his recognition of the work we are doing on flood relief in Galway and which will continue under the next Government.  More than 62 minor relief works were carried out in 2010 in south and east Galway, and major schemes, including those in Claregalway.  We are tidying up the Ballinasloe area.  Intensive discussions are being carried on with the insurance industry to ensure that they recognise where works are being done that this alters the risk factor.  A very small handful of properties cannot be economically managed by works and practically all of them are in the Deputy's part of County Galway.  The Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív and myself are trying to address this with the very small number of people involved.I wish Deputy Burke the very best in the years ahead and I thank him for his long public service.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I did not have an opportunity to refer to the betting tax issue when it was being discussed in an earlier section.  I am dealing now with section 57 but I am aware that the House dealt with the betting tax issue earlier.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I ask Deputy Hayes to deal with section 57 as these sections must be finished with by 4.30 p.m. and another section awaits.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I just want to ask a question.  The third section of this new section refers to the VAT on betting.  The first section deals with the question of postal services and the second section on cultural institutions.  If I can have the indulgence of the Chair, I wish to ask one question which I was unable to ask at the time because I was not in the Chamber.  I refer to the 1% turnover tax and the annual renewal fee which will now be charged to all the operators who provide Internet gambling, seven out of ten of whom are outside the State, effectively offshore.  Did the Minister consider the question of increasing the annual renewal fee for all operators?  I understand from the previous section that this fee ranges from €5,000 up to €100,000.  Has the Minister considered imposing a higher starting point which would ensure that the fly-by-night operators would be persuaded not to come into our market?  It will be very difficult to collect the 1% turnover tax from operators who are not based in the State on the basis that we do not have a particularly good record in chasing down turnover in operations not based here unless we have armies of people in the Revenue who will be able to chase after these issues.In the context of this section, has the Minister looked at an enhanced annual renewal fee which is proposed in the Bill to ensure that the revenue will be larger than just 1% and those who are not based here and who might attempt to hide the turnover tax will, at the very least, have to make some significant contribution by way of looking for a licence to operate here?  I ask this in the context of section 57(1)(c).  This subsection will come into operation on such day or days as the Minister for Finance might appoint by order and different days as may be appointed for different provisions for different purposes.  Why is the operation of the subsection subject to ministerial order, as opposed to other sections where an operating date is clearly notified?

Paragraph (c) replaces paragraph 10(1) of the schedule relating to VAT exemption for certain types of gambling by inserting a new subparagraph (1A).  This new provision includes within the current VAT exemption bets and commissions that have been made subject to excise duty by a separate provision of this Bill in section 46.  The bets and commissions in question are bets entered into remotely by bookmakers with persons in the State and the commissions of betting exchanges earned from bets entered into on the exchange by persons in the State.  The reason the amendment is subject to a ministerial commencement order is because the application of Internet betting duty is itself subject to a ministerial order.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	389	Regarding the health insurance levy, it is very hard for people to understand how the Supreme Court made a landmark decision on risk equalisation in 2008 and yet the Government has stated that legislation to deal with the issue will not be ready until 2013.  This levy is an imposition on people who, in many cases, are finding it difficult to manage already.  It also raises fundamental issues of health policy.  We have a health service with major difficulties; we have extraordinary inefficiencies and at the same time extraordinary stresses and strains on our hospital service.  We have an undermanned general practice primary care service and are not investing enough in general practitioners' training.  People are being charged for a visit to a GP in a way that would be unacceptable in any other European country.  Why is the Government perpetuating inequalities at a time when there should have been a fundamental reappraisal of health policy and how the health service operates?This is my last time speaking in this House.  I hope one of my legacies will be in regard to producing in 2001 the Labour Party policy document "Our Good Health", which was the first policy document of any party that developed a worked-out health insurance model to provide equal access for all while also providing for an efficient health service.  I regret very much that the Labour Party was not in a position to promote that in Government but it has been gratifying that even though at the time it was considered too radical — Fianna Fáil of course bashed it and Fine Gael kept silent — as time has gone on Fine Gael has accepted the merit of our position and has made its own proposals.  Even on the Fianna Fáil side there has been grudging acceptance that it is the way forward.  I would hope that whatever vicissitudes and difficulties the next Government will need to endure — it will undoubtedly endure many — providing and developing a universal health service with equal access for all would be its legacy.We should consider how major progressive reforming policies were initiated in the past.  I can think of two developed by Fianna Fáil Ministers, one was the access to second level education and the other was reform of general practice to provide medical cards on the basis of equal access so that it is against the law for a general practitioner to discriminate in any way between his or her private and public patients.  Why were these considerations not brought into play when introducing fiscal policy that would underpin a decent health service and give us what the people are entitled to have as members of the European Union?  Most of the population automatically presume that they can rely on such a health service where people are treated equally.We will not oppose the provision on stamp duty.  It was my honour to serve in the rainbow Government as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal.  Again, it would have been helpful had both this Government and the previous one given an honest statement or assessment of how things went so wrong.  When we left Government I was conscious, because of information that came to me, of an increase in house prices in the private market — it was quite evident.  I was satisfied, and the evidence is there on an absolutely factual basis, that we had managed to keep within the income and mortgage ratio required for a manageable market.  We could stand over that record.  Unfortunately, when the new Government came in the system and the market spiralled out of control.  Some people made very large amounts of money while others have been very badly shackled with negative equity and very large mortgages at exactly the wrong time of their lives.  Many are young people hoping to set out and have families at an expensive time of their lives or perhaps they already have young families and now have this crippling burden.The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is an intelligent and, I believe, an honest man.  Why has a good, hard, concise assessment not been carried out?  This Government is coming to the end of its days but we have a Civil Service which has provided information, analysis and very good advice through the years.  We now have a situation from which none of us can take any heart because the hole dug for us by Fianna Fáil in particular is so deep it is very hard to see a way out of it.  I believe the new government will provide the road to recovery and a fresh start which, even in itself, will be helpful.  The one thing we must not do is repeat the mistakes of the past.We already discussed tax breaks.  When I was Minister of State one of the first things I did was to commission a review on urban renewal designation, what worked, what did not, what worked aesthetically, environmentally, socially and, most important, what worked economically and financially.  That was a useful piece of work that at least tried to provide an honest appraisal of what had happened.  We made mistakes.  I would be the first to say the seaside renewal scheme was not a success and anybody who looks at the effects it had cannot take much heart from it.  Ultimately, none of us is infallible.  It is the lack of honesty and responsibility on the part of this Government which I find unnerving.  I had to smile when I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, talk about the Opposition being in denial.  Wow.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	391	We are only in the halfpenny place.I do not wish to create any difficulties because this is the last time I shall speak but I must say some words of thanks — to the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Acting Chairmen and those who preceded them.  I have been a chairperson and I know it can be a boring job as much as anything else but it requires diligence and fairness and I am very grateful for that.I wish to thank my colleagues.  As Members of this House we rely on a solidarity but it must be one based on principle and integrity.  I am very comfortable in being able to say that has always been the case in the Labour Party since I came into this House and I am extremely grateful for that.I wish to thank the Ministers I had to shadow; in health, the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Energy, Communications and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan.  I mention one particular thing the Minister, Deputy Ryan, did which was very helpful.  He ensured that civil servants in his Department were very open to providing members of the Opposition with briefings and ensuring we were well informed and able to access their expertise.  Not all Ministers are as generous.  From our point of view this has led to a more informed debate.There is a final point I wish to make.  When I came into this House in 1992 it seemed as if a new dawn had broken.  Women had, in effect, been absent from this House.  In the 1950s they were known as the "silent sisters" because they were the relations of Deputies — no other women were elected.  In the Dáil prior to 1992 there had been women pioneers such as Nuala Fennell and others who had led the way.  Coming into the House with a new cohort of women Deputies I thought something new was beginning.  It is my great regret we have stalled in that progress.  I have no idea whether there will be more women in the next Dáil;  I hope there will but I will not be overly expectant in that regard.  I hope we can achieve some kind of parity in the future.  I urge the two parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, to look to their own in this regard.  The Labour Party worked very hard to ensure we achieved the election of a critical mass of women but we are only one party.  There is a terrible gap or lacuna in both those big traditional parties in terms of female representation.  The responsibility lies with those parties to make the break through and change.The only time I felt afraid in this Chamber was when we began the debate on the abortion referendum and I realised there were so few women in this House.  There were six or seven men for every woman so there was only a handful of us who could ever know or imagine what it was like to have a crisis pregnancy.  That was a lesson that made me more determined to defeat that referendum and I am very glad the Irish people chose to do that.  However, it certainly brought home to me that it is not a fully functional Parliament unless we can have that kind of balance in the future.I do not wish to speak much longer other than to thank those who assisted me.  I also wish all those other Members who are retiring from this House all the very best and, more particularly, I wish those who are going forward well.  It is a hard station to stand for election.  Representing the people is a great honour but it is not easy and is not getting any easier.  In my view it is getting harder.  Some of the personalised attacks on the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, were unacceptable.  It is neither right nor fair that anybody should have to put up with those kinds of attacks and in particular it is not right or fair that his family should have to put up with them.  I do not say that people in this House have been guilty of that; I do not believe they have.  However, when one looks at the public space this is unacceptable.  That should be recorded.  I thank the House.

Deputies Pearse Doherty and Seymour Crawford indicated they wish to contribute on this section.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	393	Given the ticking clock and the limited time we have to deal with these matters I will try to keep my comments very brief.I enjoyed the final statement from the previous speaker and I wish her well in whatever course of action she takes in the future, as I do all retiring Deputies after the dissolution of the Dáil in the coming days.Perhaps the Minister of State can shine some light on aspects of section 60.  It is obviously very technical and refers to previous sections of enacted Bills.I welcome the section dealing with first-time buyers with regard to those who are incapacitated in terms of a dwelling house or part of such a house.  That is welcome.I have a question on the abolition of the relief for the transfer of a site from a parent to son or daughter.  Will the Minister of State provide information on the cost of that relief in the first instance?  We all know how the Irish people have an affinity with the land, arising from the history of landlordism and evictions of the past.  We are talking about a modest transfer within a family to a son or daughter, with the State taking money as part of that land transfer.  The value of the pieces of land in rural Ireland would not be excessive and I am not referring to those who are trying to abuse the system, as we have seen with bankers who transfer property to spouses in order to evade the grip of NAMA.  We are talking about genuine people who have worked hard for the wee piece of land with two or three family members and where there was always an intention to pass the land on in order for sons or daughters to build properties.Perhaps it is not the case that they will come under the revision and there will still be an exemption but will the Minister of State clarify the issue?  I am not sure if it is a practical step and I do not see the value or benefit.  I am open to suggestion from the Minister.One of the big problems with the section is that when the Minister of State dealt with section 60, he spoke about the revision and simplification of the stamp duty mechanism.  He spoke about the abolition of reliefs and those who wish to live alone and take advantage of the exemption relating to first-time buyers.  Parents or a trust would buy the house on the behalf of these people and although they would not previously have been classed as first-time buyers, they will now be classed as such as the act is on behalf of another person.  I disagree with the assertion that this will stimulate the property market and commence the necessary infrastructure for the commitment in the national recovery plan for a site value tax.  I am fundamentally opposed to the intention behind this.The details and effect of the measure with regard to taxation is separate.  This is being used to bring in a property charge, which is the fundamental problem for me and my party.  I outlined in my Second Stage contribution how indirect taxation is relied on heavily by the State, with 42% of taxes collected in 2008 in the form of indirect taxation.  This is another form of such taxation, which as we all know is not progressive.  Although a property tax may be somewhat progressive, it does not deal with ability to pay because it should be income-linked in the first instance.  The best way to ask those who have the ability to pay to give their fair share is through direct taxation, so there is a fundamental opposition to the intention behind this section.As the Minister indicated, this commences the necessary infrastructure for the commitment in the national recovery plan for a site value tax.  This plan should be abandoned.  As I mentioned in discussing the transfer of land from father to son or mother to daughter, the relief will be extinguished.  We are missing a paragraph in this legislation which would deal with the scandal that was the transfer of assets from those who have liabilities to this State through the banks and NAMA and who are transferring assets willy-nilly to spouses.This takes me back to the priorities of the Minister for Finance and his officials — although I do not blame the officials — in the construction of the Finance Bill.  Why is there no amendment dealing with banking bonuses two months after the publication of the budget?  I mentioned on Second Stage that the Finance Bill is very technical.  It is very difficult for a new Deputy who is not a chartered accountant and who does not have an economics degree to deal with it.  If I were Minister for Finance I would have told officials to include the amendment dealing with bank bonuses at an early stage.  If we had to wait for a finance (No. 2) Bill in order to introduce a charge on those earning as little as €80 per week in the guise of the universal social charge, so be it.The same logic would apply to stamp duty, an area in which those with liabilities are transferring assets in a fashion that appears completely legal now.  That is the information I have been led to believe.  There is no taxation measure to get to grips with what is in my view a morally wrong and corrupt practice.  It is our responsibility as legislators to address such issues in every finance Bill.  When we see people using tax avoidance measures we must close the loopholes immediately.  Such loopholes may be legal because they have not been identified or were purposefully left in previous Bills.  This section of the Bill could deal with the transfer of assets.The Minister has indicated that a 90% rate of tax on bank bonuses will be applied and in a similar fashion we could consider a stamp duty or transfer rate on assets flowing from one spouse to another if we know the process is to avoid liabilities to NAMA, for example.  It is pity the Bill is not being used in such fashion.  I seek clarification on the first issue I raised.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I welcome the opportunity to raise a few questions relating to the section and get some clarification.  As somebody living in a rural area I know of cases where sites are transferred from parents to sons or daughter.  It is an extremely important process which has encouraged young people to live in rural Ireland who may not have been able to afford to live there otherwise.  A cost placed on this will have a major effect.  The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, has introduced regulations to such an extent that it will be almost impossible for young people to get planning permission in rural Ireland and this further impediment will not help.  It is important to remember that sons or daughters living adjacent to family homes in rural Ireland can be extremely helpful in looking after parents or handicapped siblings.  There should be clarification on the issue as the Bill as published would be a major step backwards in this regard.Stamp duty at high levels has done much damage in the past.  The transfer of land from father to son or daughter, if it is not done before the son or daughter is 35, can bring about significant costs.  For different reasons some transfers may not be done before the son or daughter reaches 35; for example, a son or daughter may have had to leave home because of insufficient income in the home for two families.  We need to consider these types of issues carefully.I am annoyed that the Bill will require first-time buyers to pay stamp duty, albeit at a rate of 1%.  Young people are finding it impossible to get onto the housing ladder.  Recently, I encountered a case of a young couple, both of whom are in reasonable jobs, who were refused a mortgage to buy a house which cost one third of what a similar house would have cost five years ago.  We must not impede efforts to utilise the current stock of empty houses.  We need to encourage young people to move into empty houses.I listened to Deputy McManus's comments on the need for greater gender balance in the Oireachtas.  I have an interest in this matter because I encouraged a young woman to accept the nomination to follow me into the Dáil.  The lady in question will face all sorts of difficulties because the political system is structured in a manner that does not encourage female participation in politics.  Deputy McManus and other Deputies who are about to retire have been extremely able contributors to Dáil proceedings.  I hope she and other colleagues who are conscious of the difficulties experienced by politicians and their families will seek to ensure they are replaced by female colleagues and encourage greater female participation in politics.  While I fully appreciate the issue is not related to the Finance Bill, I wanted to respond to the Deputy's contribution on this issue, with which I concur.On a separate matter, we have recently been dealing with the Neary affair in Drogheda, a highly delicate matter.  When the issue first arose the presence on our team of former Deputy Nora Owen and Senator Frances Fitzgerald, also a former Deputy, was invaluable.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Last week, I spoke at a debate organised by the Historical Society of University College Cork entitled, "The Recession Then and Now".  The debate compared our current economic difficulties to the economic problems of the 1980s, focusing specifically on personal circumstances and how individuals are faring now and how they fared then.  It became apparent in the course of the evening that the circumstances leading up to the current recession are similar to those leading up to the economic problems of the 1980s.  In both cases, Governments pursued reckless policies, we had poor governance and the political system failed members of the public, not because of its structure and processes but because of the type of leadership shown by those who had responsibility to govern.On the evening of the debate, as I headed across the UCC quad, two young lads of about 13 or 14 years who happened across my path on their bicycles recognised me and said "Hello".  As one approaches a general election, it is always nice for a candidate to have one's face or name recognised.  Given that one does not normally see 13 or 14 year old children cycling on the grounds of University College Cork, I jokingly asked the two boys which subject they were studying.  They replied that they were studying economics and were currently dealing with the bond markets.  I was struck by this response because it highlights the level of discourse among members of the public about the current economic crisis.  Financial terminology such as "bond markets", "subordinated debt", the "International Monetary Fund" and other technical vocabulary have become everyday language, as reflected in my conversation with two 13 or 14 year old children.  However, while members of the public may have a better grasp of the discourse of national and international economics, do they understand our current problems better than people understood the problems of the 1980s?  The big question being asked of the Finance Bill is whether we are recreating the past or building something new.  It appears the Government is essentially seeking to recreate the conditions that led to the problem.When discussing the property market commentators frequently refer to taxation and measures that would lead to a recovery in the market.  The last thing the country needs is for the property market to recover to the levels we saw in the past decade.  Taxation policies and measures created the current crisis.  In 1999, when Deputy Eamon Gilmore was the Labour Party spokesperson on housing, my party published the Drudy report.  The report warned of a future crisis if national policy on housing was not adjusted and identified a number of key future problems.  Its warning that the employment sector would become over-reliant on the building and construction industry was proved correct when 20% of the economy subsequently became tied into the construction bubble and pyramid scheme.The Drudy report also argued that the property market would overheat.  This proved to be the case when so-called affordable homes — subsidised homes to enable people to enter the housing market — were placed on the market at €250,000.  The cost of affordable housing has since fallen by half as prices start to reflect the real economy.  During the years from the late 1990s to 2007, house prices and house price inflation reflected a parallel universe.These developments were the result of the Fianna Fáil Party's policy of incentivising property investment through taxation measures.  Homes became commodities to be bought and sold for investment purposes, at the expense of families, communities and the model of sustainable development.  Individuals bought property using loans on which they repaid the interest for two years before selling it on in the knowledge that the price would have increased.  Tax relief on interest repayments, capital gains tax changes and the stamp duty regime were used to incentivise and facilitate these types of investment.The cost of the Government's approach was that it drove the price of housing up and put it out of reach for ordinary working people.  Calculating the value of a house is a simple equation.  In normal times, a typical three bedroom, semi-detached house costs three to four times the average household income.At the height of the property madness we saw house prices for first-time buyers reaching eight to 12 times a household income depending on the region.  In rural areas the cost could be six, seven or eight times a household income, while in Dublin — particularly in suburban areas of high demand — the figure could be between ten and 12 times.Another way of measuring house values is to determine the annual rent a property will accrue and then multiply that figure by ten or 12.  Nonetheless, property values at that time were well in excess of the multiple based on annual rental income.  All the alarm bells were ringing to tell us that a serious difficulty would arise in this respect, but Fianna Fáil — in its different manifestations over those years — continued to introduce further taxation measures to create what in essence was a pyramid scheme.  People were led to believe that if they joined the scheme it would deliver in six, 12 or 18 months' time.  They were encouraged to grab the money and reinvest it.  The inference was that the pyramid scheme would continue forever on the simple premise that house prices would increase infinitely.  That could not be logical, however, if the housing market did not reflect the real economy, and it has not done so for a long time.The term "normalisation" must be used loosely regarding property sector taxation.  The Government must choose one area of the property sector over another.  The Government can either promote the concept of the principal residence and its ownership, which comprises home owners, or, as we have had to date, it can give preference to a taxation regime which incentivises investors to speculate by buying and accumulating properties, thus driving prices up.In order to have a normalised housing market, the Labour Party believes a policy is required which reflects and promotes the concept of home ownership and principal residence, although that has not existed in this country for over ten years.  For that to occur, we must have a taxation system that is neutral at least and positive at best in favour of principal residence occupation.Over the past 12 months, we have seen suggestions emanating from the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to the effect that such an approach would be taken.  In July 2010, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator published new recommendations on mortgage lending.  Those recommendations referred to getting back to the ratios I mentioned, as well as having more robust measures to examine people's incomes and other steps to ensure that such a crisis cannot recur.For those of us who first entered the Dáil in May 2007, that date now seems like a century ago.  In terms of perception, Ireland was an entirely different country to what it is now, although the writing was already on the wall.  An examination of the books showed that the difficulties we are in currently were well and truly under way.The 31st Dáil, to be elected shortly, will face an entirely different climate to the one that existed when I first entered this House in 2007.  The next Dáil will have to realise that we are not in the business of recreating or revitalising a type of housing market through various taxation measures.  Research shows that the more tax incentivisation is given to property, the more it drives prices upwards.  As surely as night follows day, if one incentivises property investment through significant tax relief, the price of property rises.  While those gaining tax relief may be beneficiaries to some extent, those who are trying to buy property, either as a retail or manufacturing business investment, or simply as home owners, will not benefit from that taxation model.In moving towards a normalised taxation system and housing market, we will have to begin picking up the pieces left by the current Government's policies.  Some 300,000 home owners are currently in negative equity as a direct result of the Government's taxation policy which drove up house prices to unsustainable levels.  In addition, 30,000 to 40,000 householders are in mortgage arrears to the extent that it is becoming a registered problem with their lending institution.  Even if they are employed and can complete robust assessment criteria to obtain loans, first-time buyers will find it difficult to get money because banks are not lending and the price of borrowing will increase significantly.I will revert to the two young lads on bicycles whom I met in UCC on Monday night.  We may have a different type of language to describe our current economic difficulties compared to the 1980s.  We may now have a broader discourse involving subordinated debt, sub-prime lending and other terminology, but are we any wiser than we were 25 or 30 years ago?  Are we again in between recessions and, if so, will we be having debates in UCC and other universities in ten years' time on future recessions and the periods in between?  In order to have economic stability, the type of governance we have witnessed in the House for 17 of the past 20 years needs to come to an end.  Political tampering and tinkering with a taxation system that benefits very few, and for which most of us must pick up the pieces, is no longer acceptable.  We need not just a new Dáil in March or April with new Deputies, but also a new governance and structure for politics.  Thus, when we debate taxation policies, it will be for the benefit of the economy and society as a whole, not just the select few who have benefited from this Government over the past 20 years.

The residential housing market is not moving at the moment, but many young couples have bought homes.  They took a risk, although people said the market was still falling.  In many such cases, people were advised to close and pay stamp duty at 1% prior to the budget, whereas they are now paying 4% or more.  The people in this group need some relief.  In some cases, they will have to pay additional stamp duty of between €10,000 and €15,000 or €16,000.  The reference to "on or after 8 December 2010" is a penal provision.  There is merit in the argument that it should be amended to read "on or after 30 November 2010".  That would give people a week's latitude.  We need to consider cases in which sales had not been closed, or were still conditional, on 8 December last.  I have contacted the Department of Finance on many occasions to raise this real issue, which affects young couples buying residential homes.I intend to introduce an amendment to deal with this matter on Report Stage and I look forward to doing so.  I ask the Minister to address it during the Committee Stage debate on section 60.  Perhaps he can give favourable consideration to the introduction of a transitional arrangement to assist people who bought a family home — as opposed to a property — "on or after 30 November 2010".  If he moves the cut-off date back a week, he will give them some relief.  We are not talking about property speculators.  We are talking about those who are paying for the mistaken policies of the banks and the Government.  They are buying homes, in many cases on the basis of advice, and thereby bringing stamp duty to the Exchequer.  I do not think the level of stamp duty should be penal.I would like to hear the Minister's views on the amendment I intend to introduce on Report Stage.  I am aware that people have been making representations to the Department of Finance on this issue.  It is fair and reasonable that we should assist young married couples and partners who are under enormous pressure at the moment.  Some of them have young children.  Their pay packets have been decimated in the last month.  Rates of child benefit have been cut.  The mortgage repayments of some young people have increased.  Many young people do not have job security.  Some of them are facing the prospect of unemployment.  They see stamp duty as dead money because it is going to the Exchequer.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments.  I know he is aware of it.  I hope to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to address it.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I would like to pick up on the issue raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  I am sure the Minister agrees that difficulties will exist regardless of the deadline one sets in this regard.  Deputy O'Donnell made the point that there is a fundamental difference between 1% and 4%.  It could be worth many thousands of euro to young couples who are finding it difficult to get 10% from the banks to furnish their homes.  It could ultimately make a huge difference.  There is some merit in the idea that the Minister should consider the matter.  I suspect the number of people affected by this measure is not huge.  Perhaps the Revenue Commissioners have given the Minister some indication of the total number involved.  It is a small group of people.  A fair change, if not a substantial one, is required.Section 60 provides for transitional arrangements whereby purchasers who entered into binding contracts before budget day, and execute the relevant instrument before 1 July 2011, will not have to pay an increased amount of stamp duty.  Some degree of fairness is built into the system and will last six months.  If one draws down one's contract within six months of the date of budget day, one will pay the lesser amount.  I assume that is the 1% rate.  I can understand that.  Can the Minister explain the rationale for the six-month timeframe that has been provided for after budget day?  Why was a 12-month timeframe not provided for?  We are not talking in every case about people who will initiate the relevant instrument within six months.  It will depend on conveyancing and agreements between purchasers and vendors, for example.  What is the rationale for the six-month period that applies to the transitional arrangement?  Is it based on the fact that such a period applied when stamp duty changes were made in the past?We are discussing the general issue of Part 4, which relates to stamp duty, but I would like to refer specifically to section 60.  There is considerable anger in society, particularly among those in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s who paid substantial amounts of stamp duty over the last ten years.  In many cases, they had to borrow between €40,000 and €60,000 to meet their stamp duty requirements.  They have been lumbered with significant debts.  They may be among the 350,000 people in negative equity, to whom we often refer.  Ultimately, some form of release will be needed to resolve the difficulties of those who are paying enormous mortgages and are hugely in debt.  As a society, we have a responsibility to develop some means of releasing them from their debt.  A societal benefit would be associated with establishing such a means.  In the absence of such a mechanism, many people will be unable to spend, consume and contribute to society as we may wish.  I do not under-estimate the depth of the anger that exists across society, including parts of my constituency, about the sizable amounts of stamp duty people had to pay over the last decade or so.I remind the House that not a million years ago, the then leader of a certain party lectured us that we did not need the revenue that was being generated from stamp duty.  That says a great deal about the political judgment of the former Deputy, who represented the constituency of Dublin South-East when he was proposing these radical changes in the stamp duty regime.  It goes to the heart of the collapse in the Irish economy that such a large amount of the tax that was raised each year in our society depended on stamp duty.  It was completely unsustainable to rely on such a transaction tax.  It was out of character with European norms.  This society and this economy has to rectify that.  I ask the Minister to examine the transitional arrangements in section 60.  Can he give some indication of the number of people involved?  I suspect it is quite small.  Can he deal with Deputy O'Donnell's point before he initiates his amendment for the purposes of Report Stage?
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	398	In the context of section 60, which provides for the termination of property reliefs, I wish to raise the transfer of a portion of land from a parent to a child.  It is primarily a rural issue.  It is particularly unfair and unreasonable to remove this property-based tax relief at a time when the banks are closed, the rate of stamp duty is being increased in some cases and we are trying to get some people back to work.  Those who are not lumbered with the cost of purchasing a site are among the few who can currently proceed with the construction of a property.  The Government is proposing to remove the tax-based relief they currently enjoy.  It is particularly unfair that such people will now have to pay stamp duty.  If we are serious about encouraging some movement in the property market, we need to look at this.  While this problem applies mainly to rural Ireland, it can also have an effect on urban Ireland.  If somebody has an urban dwelling on a large site, he or she may be fortunate enough to have enough space to build another property.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be familiar with such cases in Wexford town.  In such circumstances, the proposed extinguishing of this tax-based relief will kick in.  I ask the Minister to consider this, taking into account that we must get people back to work.  I would like to hear from the Minister how much income this is likely to generate for the State.

She made a particular contribution to the development of Labour Party health policy.  One of the things I will be interested to observe in the future — Fine Gael has a similar policy — is how such a system can be successfully superimposed on the present structure and what sort of vested interests will be encountered along the way.While I am on the subject, I believe Deputy Crawford will also retire from the House, and I pay tribute to the service he has given to an electorate that lives along the Border, including during troubled times.  I have had quite a bit of contact with the Deputy on different issues and I have always found him an exceptionally honourable and decent parliamentarian, speaking from the heart about his community.The issue raised by Deputies Doherty and D'Arcy relates to tax relief on sites transferred between a parent and his or her child.  The cost of this relief is €6 million in a year.  Offspring are still eligible for the half-rate applicable to transfers between family members.  It should be pointed out that the average price of an acre of agricultural land is now less than €10,000, and if such a site were transferred, no tax would be payable.  That price is considerably less than it was a couple of years ago.  On a piece of land suitable for residential development, which would cost more than average, the rate of duty would still be low, at 1% between €10,000 and €20,000, and so on.We should recall that Ireland is one of the only OECD countries that does not have an annual tax on property.  We need to broaden the tax base, and a tax on property is one way to do this.  This has been recommended not only by the Commission on Taxation but by nearly every independent body. I find it surprising that all parties in the House, including Sinn Féin, are on the conservative side of the Government on this issue.The capital gains tax relief on the transfer of sites to children for the purpose of building a principal private residence remains in place.  However, as many of us know from planning decisions, we need to be aware of the potential for abuse.  For example, in a family with five children, sites may be released to each of the five children and then sold on after a little while to people outside the family.  This has happened in the past.  The system as it is at present confers a considerable benefit.  I will be interested to see whether the parties opposite, if they come to this side, will still make the same arguments in a few months' time.Deputy O'Donnell raised the issue of stamp duty relief on certain dates.  The possibility of stamp duty changes in the budget was generally recognised, and the problem — as mentioned by Deputy Hayes — is that no matter what date is fixed, some people will unfortunately be just on the wrong side.  To fix a date of 30 November would perhaps increase the sense of injustice felt by those who bought on 29 November.

By reference to experience when stamp duty was changed in the past, the six-month period may be considered generous.  Six months is an adequate period in which to formalise conveyances.Deputy Ciarán Lynch talked about the affordable homes initiative and the rise in house prices.  There were efforts in the late 1990s, including the two Bacon reports, to damp down the growth of prices in the property market, and I had some regrets at the time that the fight was abandoned.  There were considerable pressures.  It was always easy to make the argument that building more and more houses would create jobs in construction and give people homes.  As I have said before, there were not many voices telling us in the boom years that we ought to go more slowly.  One of them was the former European Commissioner Pedro Solbes, who said this in 2001 to Charlie McCreevy——

This may have contributed to the loss of the first Nice referendum.  However, I am afraid the Commissioner was right and the Minister and most of the rest of us were wrong.Deputy Hayes made an oblique reference to a former Deputy, and Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, on the subject of stamp duty.  It must be said that Fine Gael was very active on the stamp duty issue not long after that time.

Is that an argument that one can never change anything?  Any reduction in tax will feel inequitable to those who paid more previously.  It is a difficult issue, and I am sceptical as to whether a new Government will find the financial scope, however desirable it may be, to provide some compensation for those who were unfortunately caught by the change.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	411	On the practical issue, I know that many calls have been made to the Department of Finance — although not a huge number — from people who are upset because, when they were purchasing their homes, the stamping instrument went through prior to 8 December.  Similarly, there are cases of people who bought their homes on the same date.  Some would have effectively put through the statutory instrument prior to 8 December, and some might have done this afterwards, even though the sale might have gone through at the same time, because, I believe, they have to put it through, I believe, within 30 days.Has the Department quantified the number of people this new provision would affect?  I agree with the Minister of State's sentiments to the effect that the situation cannot be so inflexible as to preclude the Department looking at change.  Has the cost to the Exchequer been quantified — because I would say the Department of Finance has received a reasonable number of calls in this regard — by amending the date from 8 December to 30 November?  I am putting this purely in respect of the family home.  I ask the Minister to look at it, as it is a relatively small measure.  Does the Minister know how many people it would impact on if the date was to be changed from 8 December to 30 November and what effect would this have on the Exchequer?  Some €3,000 or €4,000 or even €10,.000 to an ordinary hard-pressed family is an infinitely higher proportion to that family than the cost to the State.  I ask the Minister of State to deal with these practicalities.

Likewise, reliefs and concessions should be prospective as special circumstances dictate.  Otherwise, if a concession were to be granted, it would serve as a precedent every time stamp duty or any other event or transaction tax such as capital gains tax or capital acquisitions tax were to be changed.  That is the reason why there would be considerable hesitation.I am aware, of course, that in various parts of the tax code some transitional relief has been granted from time to time.  That, in any event, is the situation at the moment.  There has been a good deal of talk today about a finance Bill (No. 2) later in the year and if the Deputy's party is in office, it is very welcome to look at the matter again.

I should like if for Report Stage the Minister could ask his officials to quantify the number of people this would affect, based on representations, and the cost to the Exchequer.

In page 201, before section 61, to insert the following new section:61.—(1) The Principal Act is amended by substituting the following for section 106B:"106B.—(1) In this section ‘housing authority' means—(a) a housing authority, within the meaning of the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009, in connection with any of its functions under those Acts,or(b) the Affordable Homes Partnership established under article 4(1) of the Affordable Homes Partnership (Establishment) Order 2005 (S.I. No. 383 of 2005) in connection with the services specified in article 4(2) of that Order, as amended by the Affordable Homes Partnership (Establishment) Order 2005 (Amendment) Order 2007 (S.I. No. 293 of 2007).(2) Stamp duty shall not be chargeable on any instrument giving effect to the conveyance, transfer or lease of a house, building or land to a housing authority.(3) Stamp duty on any instrument giving effect to the conveyance, transfer or lease of a house, building or land by a housing authority chargeable, as specified in Schedule 1, shall not exceed €100.".(2) This section applies to an instrument executed on or after 1 April 2011.".This amendment inserts a new section 61 and substitutes a new section 106B in the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act.  Section 106B implies a stamp duty exemption on a conveyance of property by or to a housing authority or the Affordable Homes Partnership.  There is no requirement to present the instrument to the Revenue Commissioners and as such there is no record of the transaction in Revenue's e-stamping system.This would affect the collection of data for compiling house valuations both for the purposes of publishing a valuation database, to bring greater transparency to the housing market, and  for the introduction of a site value tax, as proposed in the national recovery plan.  On the other hand, applying a full stamp duty charge to such transfers could reduce the take-up of the enhanced tenant purchase scheme for local authority tenants which the Minister announced in the budget.To meet these competing concerns, this amendment removes the stamp duty exemption in so far as this relates to a conveyance of property by the local authority or the Affordable Homes Partnership.  Accordingly, such transfers will have to be presented to Revenue for stamping and details of the consideration will be recorded.  However, the stamp duty payable will be limited to a maximum amount of €100 and such a low level of duty is unlikely to deter take-up of the tenant purchase scheme.  The amendment will take effect for conveyances executed on or after 1 April 2011, and I commend this amendment to the Committee.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	416	This was flagged by the statement made by the Minister on the night of the budget, I believe.  It was welcomed at the time, in respect of removing stamp duty.  In general, this amendment is welcome.  On the question of valuation of social housing, given that there is such a reduction in the price of property generally across the economy, what is the mechanism for doing that, and what is market value now?  As regards social housing, affordable housing or shared ownership, how is market value arrived at given the difficulties involved in establishing what it is?
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The former Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, made an announcement that the tenant purchase scheme would now be adapted and that there would be a 45% discount for people who had been social housing tenants for 15 years and over.  I believe that is what is being referred to in the section there.  The former Minister of State also gave the impression that this would be enacted on 1 January and that local authorities would be able to roll that out.  Given that we are debating it in the House this evening, it is clear that local authorities are not in a position to do that currently.  Could the Minister of State indicate as to when social housing tenants will be able to avail of the 45% discount?With regard to something the Labour Party has been consistently calling for over a number of years, the housing price database, this is necessary because it is the only way that accurate housing information and prices can be given.  It would give confidence to people buying homes to ensure that the prices they pay are reflective of true market value in their estates, and this resonates into social housing situations, as Deputy Hayes has indicated.  The core principle, if we are to introduce normalisation into the housing market, is to have an accurate house register database.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State indicated this in his speech this evening.  Once again, is there a timeline as to when this will be in place?
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	418	With regard to section 62 and the different rates of stamp duty, the reduction as regards lower valued properties is to be welcomed, since people on low incomes were being penalised.  I know the Government is getting rid of the exemption from stamp duty for properties under €127,000, so people who buy a very small house worth, say, €80,000 to €100,000 or whatever will now be subject to stamp duty.  However, the Minister of State referred to the fact that properties valued at more than €1 million will be subject to the 2% rate as distinct from the existing 9% rate.  There are still trophy houses on the market in the region of €5 million.  Based on what the Minister of State has said, the reduction we are introducing in this Finance Bill is in the region of 7%, which would mean a total saving for somebody buying such a trophy house of, say, €350,000.  How can this be reconciled with charging stamp duty on modest housing worth in the region of €120,000?  There is a major saving to be made for those buying at the very high end of the market.  The intention here is to stimulate the property market, which is not moving currently, but we have had situations before where all types of reliefs were introduced in Finance Bills and so called "section 23 reliefs" to stimulate the market.We know where that got us.  We need to be careful and to ensure those who have the ability to pay do so.  This includes anyone buying at the high end of the market.  Even if the direct saving from 9% to 2% does not amount to €350,000, and I understood it was tiered, the public could not countenance that type of saving as a result of the Finance Bill given that the State is trying to make savings.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could subsequently reply.

Section 89(4) of the Act provides for a clawback of agricultural relief where agricultural property is disposed of within six years of acquiring a gift or an inheritance and is not replaced within one year of the disposal by other agricultural property.Section 102A(2) provides for a clawback of agricultural and business relief in respect of the development value of development land where that land is disposed of after six years of acquiring a gift or an inheritance and within ten years of that date.  Section 104(3) provides for a clawback of the CGT credit allowed against CAT where the property in respect of which the credit was given is disposed of within two years of acquiring a gift or an inheritance.The section ensures that the clawback in sections 89(4) and 104(3) will apply where a disposal takes place on the date of the gift or inheritance.  The section also ensures that the clawback of agricultural and business relief in respect of the development value of development land provided for in section 102A(2) will apply where such land is disposed of on the sixth anniversary of the date of the gift or the inheritance.  The section applies to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 21 January 2011.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	423	This area of taxation is complex.  I understand the Minister of State to mean that, up to now, a farmer who sold his farm to the NRA, for example, and used all the proceeds to buy more agricultural land was exempt from capital acquisitions tax.  Will the Minister of State outline the implications for a farmer who gives a site to a son or daughter?  What is the position if a farmer's daughter has planning permission for a site, thus making it development land, but disposes of the site without building thereon because she is nursing, then marries a man from Dundalk and moves on?  If one has built on a site, is its value taken into account if it is disposed of within the six-year period?  Is that governed by different sections of the Act?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	424	This is only correcting very minor points.  It is crossing t's and dotting i's so a particular date will not be taken from a pedantic legal point of view as not being covered by the legislation.  There are no implications except those that apply at precedent.This section is required because the Revenue Commissioners received counsel's opinion in a case involving a clawback of the capital gains tax credit allowed against capital acquisitions tax.  In that case, counsel advised that, because the clawback provision referred to a period within two years after a gift or inheritance, the clawback did not apply where the disposal arose on the date of the gift.  This is the way folks seem to interpret the law.  I have always had a bit of an objection to that type of pedantic interpretation.  However, that is the position and, therefore, provisions must be absolutely explicit or our learned brethren will find a way around them.Related difficulties arise with the provisions for clawing back agricultural relief or business relief on gifts and the inheritance of development land.  Section 64 amends the relevant sections to ensure that a disposal of the gifted inherited property, on the date of a gift in the case of CGT credit and agricultural relief or on the sixth anniversary of a gift or inheritance in the case of agricultural or business relief on development land, triggers a clawback of the relief in question.  In other words, the measure is combating a pedantic interpretation of the clause.  It is not contrary to the spirit of the measure.  It is only aimed at those who might exploit a legal loophole.  As we know, loopholes sometimes appear in law after the enactment of legislation without their having been in any sense the intent of the legislator.  Anybody who operated the relief as intended would be unaffected by this measure.  It has no particular implications for roll-over relief in the case of the NRA or in any other case.

In page 205, subsection (1), lines 26 to 29, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following:"(c) as if, in the definition of “threshold amount” in paragraph 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 2, the consumer price index number for the year 2009 applied to gifts and inheritances taken in the year 2011.”.This amendment corrects a drafting error in section 65(1)(c) of the Bill.  The effect of that paragraph would be to disapply indexation entirely for gifts and inheritances taken in 2011.  The intention is that the annual change in the CAT-free group thresholds from 1 January by reference to the consumer price index number for the previous year will not apply to gifts and inheritances taken in 2011.  This amendment will achieve this result so the tax-free thresholds after indexation, which were reduced by approximately 20% in budget 2011 for gifts and inheritances taken on or after 8 December 2011, will also apply to gifts and inheritances taken in 2011.I will outline the relevant tax-free thresholds that will apply to gifts and inheritances taken in 2011.  The group A tax-free threshold, which broadly covers transfers from parent to child, is €332,084.  The group B tax-free threshold, which broadly covers transfers between siblings, from children to parents, from grandparents to grandchildren, and from uncles and aunts to nephews and nieces, is €33,208.  The group C tax-free threshold, which covers all cases not covered in groups A and B, is €16,604.

In page 205, subsection (1)(a), lines 35 and 36, to delete “ “30 September” for “31 October” “ and substitute ““30 June” for “31 August””.This arose from the decision by the Minister in the draft finance Bill to bring forward the date of filing of tax returns on the part of certain taxpayers from 31 October to 30 September.  I understand the Minister has agreed with Deputies Lowry and Healy-Rae——

Section 46(2)(a) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides that where the valuation date in respect of a gift or inheritance arises in the period from 1 January to 31 August in a year, tax must be paid and a return must be delivered on or before 31 October in that year.Where the valuation date arises between 1 September and 31 December, tax must be paid and a return must be delivered on or before 31 October in the following year.  Interest on outstanding tax runs from 1 November in the relevant year.  In addition, there is a surcharge where a return is delivered after 31 October in the relevant year.The effect of amendment No. 95, tabled by Deputy Noonan, would be to move the relevant date referred to in section 46(2)(a) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 forward from 31 August to 30 June.  In addition, the Deputy seeks consequential changes in regard to the provisions dealing with the date when interest on overdue tax becomes chargeable and the date when the surcharge for late returns arises.As the amendments proposed by Deputy Noonan would reduce the yield from gift tax and inheritance tax by €30 million in 2011 because of the shortening of the relevant period referred to in section 46(2)(a) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, I am not in a position to accept them, especially given the current state of the public finances.

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has no objection in principle to the amendment.

Will the Minister of State read out his note on this section so that we might have a sense of what is intended?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Section 68 amends section 817M of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which is concerned with the provision by promoters to the Revenue Commissioners of details of clients to whom certain disclosable transactions were made available for implementation.  This provision forms part of the legislation governing the mandatory disclosure of certain transactions regime, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2010 and was followed by regulations on 17 January 2011.During a consultation process on the proposed regulations last summer, concerns were raised regarding taxpayers being identified to the Revenue Commissioners in circumstances where those taxpayers may not have undertaken the transactions concerned.  This section modifies the original provision to remove the disclosure obligation on promoters where they are satisfied the client did not undertake the transaction at the time in question.  If the transaction is undertaken at a later time, the client's details must be disclosed in a normal way.  The regulations will be amended in due course to take account of this change.

The transaction needs to have been made.  If it is merely discussed and not acted upon, the situation is different.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	442	Do the Minister of State's officials have a view on how much income has been lost to Revenue through these aggressive forms of tax planning?During the past year or more, a great deal of information has emanated about people with deposit accounts in Switzerland in particular that have been used to avoid tax.  In well publicised cases, whistleblowers there have identified people from various jurisdictions who have been salting money away from the prying eyes of tax collectors.  I would not be surprised if some of those people were from Ireland.In the interests of ensuring aggressive tax planning does not occur, perhaps the Minister of State could inform the House about the situation pertaining to people with non-resident deposits in tax havens like Switzerland and Austria where banking regulations are extraordinarily secretive.  For example, we know from The FitzPatrick Tapes of a strange transaction involving Anglo Irish Bank, which took the Taoiseach out golfing and so on at various intervals prior to the State’s guarantee of the bank.  He was telephoned in Singapore and attended a dinner hosted by Anglo Irish Bank in Heritage House just before he became Taoiseach.  In July 2008 before the bank guarantee there was the famous round of golf and dinner afterwards with various Anglo notables.  It has always intrigued me that the purpose of these contacts made by Mr. FitzPatrick was, presumably, to plead with the Taoiseach that the bank needed deposits from the National Treasury Management Agency.  At or around the time of the guarantee, this bank had a subsidiary in Austria where banking secrecy is extreme.  Lo and behold, shortly after the guarantee, this bank which desperately needed deposits, sold the Austrian subsidiary with about €600 million in deposits.  What has always intrigued me is how did a bank, which was begging for deposits, sell a subsidiary bank with deposits of €600 million.  Was this connected to tax avoidance transactions?

They cannot be answered on the floor of the House now.  I ask the Deputy to deal with the specific details of section 68.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The section describes transactions and persons and contains a reference to promoters.  The transfer of large deposits of money from the Irish jurisdiction to tax havens by means of promoters or to places where there is a practice of banking secrecy, is the highest form of aggressive tax avoidance management that I am aware of.  The Minister will remain a Minister for the duration of the general election and until the new Government is formed.  I have written to the Minister for Finance about this on a previous occasion.  I understand the Minister of State does not have an answer to hand but this is a very murky area of aggressive tax planning.  Will the Minister of State arrange——

I ask the Minister of State to give the background to the amendment.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I am unable to give the background details but it is an ongoing if not an eternal battle between Revenue and governments against tax evasion and either aggressive forms of avoidance or tax evasion.  The Deputy is a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and will be aware that a great deal of progress has been made in extending double taxation agreements, taxation information, exchange schemes and narrowing the space in which jurisdictions which have been very happy to welcome deposits in the utmost secrecy, without inquiring too much into their legality in terms of the law of the country from which they come, can operate.  More work remains to be done and disclosures were made with regard to Liechtenstein.  The United States in particular, has been very strong on this.  The German Social Democrat Minister for Finance, Peer Steinbrück, was exceptionally strong.  He and his French counterpart organised some meetings to deal with this matter and Ireland has always been supportive.  In one respect, Ireland has a law on tax evasion that is without counterpart in any other country, which allows for the quarterly publication of lists of defaulters and penalties.  I have been informed by both German and British delegations that although they are quite impressed, they did not think this would work in their jurisdictions.  Ireland is ahead of the posse in that respect.This provision only applies where no scheme has been implemented.  Revenue does not want to know who might have looked at a scheme so long as they did not bite.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I move amendment No. 96:
In page 206, to delete lines 27 to 35 and substitute the following:""(c) Where the Revenue Commissioners issue a notice of attachment in respect of any amount of money due by the relevant person to the taxpayer as emoluments under a contract of service, and where the relevant person is controlled by the taxpayer within the meaning of Section 10, the notice may provide for the payment by the relevant person of the amount of the default out of the emoluments, after taking account of statutory deductions, over a period specified in the notice.”,”.Section 70 amends section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which is concerned with Revenue's power of attachment in respect of outstanding debt.  Revenue will now be able to issue a notice of attachment in respect of emoluments and may provide for the attachment of such emoluments to be spread over a period of time.  The amendment is drafted to modify this provision and to focus it more acutely where the Revenue Commissioners issue notice of attachment in respect of any amount of money due by the relevant person to the taxpayer as emoluments under a contract of service and where the relevant person is controlled by the taxpayer within the meaning of section 10, the notice may provide for the payment by the relevant person of the amount of the default out of the emoluments after taking account of statutory deductions over a period specified in the notice.

The correction is as follows: in paragraph (d) at the end of page 41, the reference to section 784(3) should read, section 784C(3).I also wish to give notice that the Minister will be moving two amendments on Report Stage.  First, an amendment to a section of the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, to deal with the taxation of excess remuneration paid to persons employed in an institution that has received financial support under either the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 or the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000.  Second, an amendment deleting section 18 of the Bill, as amended in its entirety on Committee Stage.  This section deals with self-assessment pay and file.

#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I will deal with amendment No. 96 regarding the attachment of debt.  Attachment is an enforcement option available to the Revenue Commissioners to recover unpaid tax, unpaid interest or unpaid penalty due by taxpayers who have ignored the normal collection approaches and notification procedures taken by Revenue.  Attachment is used judiciously by Revenue in accordance with strict guidelines which require that any decision to use attachment must be approved at principal officer or nominated assistant principal officer level.  A number of amendments to the attachment provisions are being made in the light of the experience of the Revenue Commissioners to make them more effective in the pursuit of tax defaulters who have ignored all reasonable attempts by Revenue to collect taxes in default and to improve efficiencies in certain situations.When attachment was introduced in 1988, attachment of emoluments was not regarded as necessary by reference to the circumstances that prevailed at the time.  However, circumstances have since changed and many persons now carrying on trades and professions also derive emoluments from directorships and employments.  In addition, certain persons carrying on trades and professions have ceased those activities leaving undisputed tax liabilities unpaid.  Where these people have directorships or employments, it is appropriate that they should meet their tax debts of previous and current years whatever the source of their resources.  Where this is not done on a voluntary basis, it is appropriate that the Revenue Commissioners have the use of the attachment procedure where necessary to recover these debts.  I emphasise that attachment is used by the Revenue Commissioners only where all normal collection attempts have been ignored by the taxpayer.If the amendment was accepted, it would seriously restrict the Revenue Commissioners' ability to recover outstanding debts in circumstances where the individual had ceased trading leaving substantial unpaid tax liabilities and was now in employment where due to the level of net income it was deemed appropriate to use the attachment procedure.  In these circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.

The need for such provision arises because of the volume and comprehensiveness of personal and commercial information concerning taxpayers which Revenue acquires.  At present, there is no specific tax-related provision other than the statutory declaration made by inspectors in respect of Schedule D tax and corporation tax governing confidentiality requirements.  Reliance is placed on the absolute ban imposed by the Official Secrets Act on civil servants revealing any information acquired in an official capacity.  This section provides a specific tax-related provision which will reassure taxpayers that personal and commercial information revealed for tax purposes is protected against unauthorised disclosure.  In other words, this strengthens by being specific the rights of the taxpayer.

This section provides that tax can be paid to Revenue by credit card, debit card or any other method or methods of payment which is or are approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  The section enables the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations relating to these payment methods.  This measure is a customer service initiative to provide taxpayers with additional options for the payment of taxes and duties and will give them greater flexibility for making payments while also facilitating voluntary compliance.

The amendment adds seven countries to the list of countries in Part 1 with which the State has entered into a double taxation agreement, DTA, and eight countries or territories to the list of countries or territories in Part 3 with which the State has entered into a tax information exchange agreement, TIEA.  It also adds four protocols to update the provisions of four existing double taxation agreements.Double taxation treaties are widely regarded as critical pieces of fiscal infrastructure for developing substantial bilateral trading and investment opportunities by reducing tax impediments that might otherwise deter cross-border activity.  To ensure that Irish business remains competitive and that Ireland remains an attractive destination for foreign direct investment we have been rapidly expanding our double tax treaty network.  The six new double taxation agreements are with Albania, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Montenegro, Morocco, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.  The addition of these six agreements — I am sorry, as I may have misled the House; I count seven rather than six.  The addition of these seven agreements will bring to 62 — or possibly 63 — the number of double taxation agreements that Ireland will have ratified.The four protocols are under the existing double taxation agreements with Austria, Germany, Malaysia and South Africa.  These protocols provide for the updating of the exchange of information articles in the Malaysian, Austrian and South African agreements.  The protocol to the German double taxation convention updates the convention to reflect the current taxation laws of both countries.  The protocol to the South African agreement as well as updating the exchange of information article also reflects the change in the taxation laws of South Africa with regards to taxation on dividends.Tax information exchange agreements are also important international agreements which strengthen the ability of the revenue authorities in both countries to enforce their tax laws and thereby encourage the development of closer economic relations between both countries.  The eight TIEAs are with Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Samoa.  These will bring to 17 the number of tax information exchange agreements that Ireland will have ratified.All of these agreements have been considered and approved by the Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 15 December 2010 as part of their ratification process.  The addition of these 19 countries or territories to schedule 24A is the final step in the legislative and ratification procedure that will ensure that these agreements will have the force of law.

I am not fully convinced that the withholding tax on transfers from Hong Kong is appropriate and may continue to be a disincentive for investment in the Irish Financial Services Centre.Has the Minister of State or his officials had any second thoughts on the matter?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	470	No.  If the Deputy recalls I gave him a note on that.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The Minister of State said he was doing it because he thought there might be a vehicle for evasion; one could say that about anything.

Hong Kong has a territorial taxation system under which foreign-sourced income including interest will not be sourced in Hong Kong.  Furthermore Hong Kong does not have a withholding tax on interest payments paid to non-residents.  These features of its tax system could open up possibilities of aggressive tax planning involving the Ireland-Hong Kong double taxation agreement.  Ireland's usual treaty policy is to seek nil withholding rates for interest payments.  However, to avoid double non-taxation a 10% rate was agreed to be included in the treaty.  I am afraid there has been no consideration of this, but like everything else the next Government will be free to have a look at it if it wishes.

Are there any obvious places which might have been a location for investors in this jurisdiction?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	480	The principal one with which we are working at the moment is Brazil, which is a very large economy.  The Deputy will have heard of the phrase, the BRIC countries, which are major countries in the developing world.  He can do the arithmetic for himself; if we have approximately 70 double taxation agreements and there are more than 200 countries in the world, we have some way to go.  We prioritise those with which we have either trading or commercial relations.  This is an area that has been expanding very rapidly.  While I do not know if it is true today, it was certainly true four or five years ago that with the exception of Singapore, Ireland is practically the most globalised economy in the world and so obviously we need these agreements because we are trading with many different countries.  The negotiations with Brazil are slow, but we are continuing to negotiate.  We are also negotiating with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Philippines.

We seem to have moved very rapidly this evening and there are not many matters of substance that need much time on Report Stage.  I do not want to agree any schedule that ties us into a lengthy sitting that may not be necessary.

It was originally planned that completion of Committee Stage would be at 11 a.m. tomorrow but as it has now been completed Report Stage will start at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow instead of 11 o'clock and will proceed for six hours.  I gather a meeting has been arranged between party representatives and officials before 10.30 a.m. tomorrow to prepare for Report Stage.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	488	Sections 1 to 38 at the beginning of the Bill are of most interest to Members and include the changes to pension provisions, the universal social charge and section 23 tax breaks.  Today's schedule allowed very little time for that part and considerable time for areas including giving Revenue extra powers in combating tax evasion and so on.  We should devote most of the time to sections 1 to 38 because many Members want to contribute on those and, as the Minister of State knows, the debate on Report Stage is truncated anyway.  If three or four hours are being allocated to Report Stage, on behalf of the Labour Party I ask the Minister of State to consider, together with the Whips, devoting the bulk of that time to sections 1 to 38 because there was not enough time for Members to raise any queries or make any point today.

The grant was withdrawn due to concerns about the constitutionality of making it available to fee-charging schools of one ethos and not to those of another.However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to supporting education in schools under Protestant management, while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.In this regard, I had a useful meeting with Protestant educational representatives on 9 September last.  At the conclusion of that meeting, we agreed to continue our discussions on funding issues pertaining to Protestant fee-charging schools.  Since then, my officials have had further meetings with the educational representatives and will continue to do so.I am committed to continuing this engagement with members of the Protestant community, as I believe that these issues are best resolved collaboratively.

Through DEIS an additional €40million was provided bringing the allocation for disadvantage in schools to in excess of €200million. In light of this additional investment, a decision was taken in Budget 2009 to discontinue the Children at Risk Fund.The project to which the Deputy refers was among a number of projects evaluated by the Evaluation, Support and Research Unit in conjunction with the Inspectorate of the Regional Directorate of this Department in 2009, to assist in determining future funding arrangements and possible mainstreaming of appropriate projects or models of intervention.As a result of this evaluation, funding of €133,000 issued to the Project in December for 2011 and a process has begun to integrate the Fr. McGrath Centre Homework Club & Study Support with the Kilkenny City School Completion Programme (SCP) Project, as both projects share the same aims and objectives. The School Completion Programme is a major component of DEIS and provides support for targeted children who are at risk of early school leaving. The supports are provided through 124 local projects and include interventions on school attendance, literacy/numeracy, after school, homework, holiday time supports as well as social and sporting interventions.The National Coordination Team for the School Completion Programme has commenced work on the integration of both projects and a meeting with the project to which the Deputy refers will be arranged shortly.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.Following on from the European Court of Justice's Judgement, my Department last year, ceased the practice of calculating the weighted average price for cigarettes.  There was no change required to the legislation as the arrangements to calculate a weighted average price were on the basis of an agreement with the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee (ITMAC) affiliated tobacco companies, who forwarded data on sales volumes and retail prices to year end each year.  From this information, a weighted average price was calculated and industry were advised "if the recommended retail price of any brand of cigarettes is less than 97% of the weighted average price it will be considered as a "sales promotion device".The Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 35 of 2000) provides a definition for "sales promotion device", and, as such, the framework for the setting of the weighted average price. There are other instances of a sales promotion device that may need to be dealt with in the future e.g. — 3 for 2, buy one get one half price, "happy hour" promotion etc. In the circumstances, an amendment of the regulations is not necessary as it may be necessary to invoke the regulations in relation to potential illegal practices that may arise in the future.

Under the scheme, in return for providing the free Pre-School Year to eligible children, a pre-school service will be paid an annual capitation for each eligible child enrolled.  The standard capitation rate is €2,450 per annum and a higher capitation rate of €2,850 per annum is payable to services with more highly qualified staff.Children are eligible to participate in the scheme when they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months in September of the relevant year.  At September 2010, some 4,300 pre-school services, or 95% of all such services, are participating in the scheme.  63,000 children, or 94% of all eligible children are availing of the free Pre-School Year.  The ECCE scheme cost approximately €154 million in 2010 and is expected to cost €166 million in 2011.  Applications for new services to enter the scheme from September 2011 will be available shortly from the local City or County Childcare Committee.My Office also has responsibility for the implementation of the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) which includes a capital grant programme to develop childcare facilities.  However, as this programme closed to new capital grant applicants in 2009, I regret to advise the Deputy that capital expenditure in 2010 and 2011 is confined to existing capital grant commitments.

When pharmacists submit reimbursement claims to the HSE for medicines dispensed to patients under the GMS and other community drug schemes no information is provided as to which condition or illness a particular medicinal product has been prescribed. As a result the information sought by the Deputy is not collected or compiled by the HSE.The prices paid by the HSE for medicines dispensed under the Drugs Payment Scheme and the Long Term Illness Scheme are the same. Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.

This replaced all existing early retirement schemes, and no others were available after the closing date of the ISER, until the introduction of the Voluntary Early Retirement and Voluntary Redundancy schemes which were announced on 1 November 2010.The Government decided in November 2010 that in view of the need to achieve a permanent reduction in the number employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards, and to facilitate public health reform, that targeted voluntary early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes should be introduced for certain grades in the health sector.  As this scheme post dated the retirement date of the person in question, its terms were not, unfortunately, available to him.The ISER was a voluntary scheme and the individual concerned made a decision to avail of the scheme, based on the terms of that scheme, which included the immediate payment of pension without actuarial reduction, and the payment of 10% lump sum at time of retirement, with the balance of 90% payable when the retiree reaches normal preserved pension age.  Each applicant signed an undertaking to abide by the terms of the ISER and, therefore, I regret it is not possible to alter the terms which have already been accepted.

There are no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

It is also the responsibility of the HSE to assess on an annual basis the number and type of specialist medical training posts required by the health service and to put proposals to the Medical Council.  Under the Act, it is a matter for the Medical Council, on foot of proposals received from the HSE, to specify the number and type of posts it approves for the purposes of specialist medical education and training.

The moratorium on public sector recruitment is not a factor in these NCHD vacancies. Other countries are also experiencing difficulties in recruiting NCHDs at present.The HSE has developed a range of strategies and initiatives to maximise recruitment. It is currently progressing the development of a centralised recruitment process for service posts with a view to this system being fully operational for the July 2011 recruitment cycle.  In December 2010, the HSE advertised all vacant non-training NCHD posts as ‘Professional Development Posts' under 2 year contracts to one of the four HSE Areas, with a minimum of 6 months in a regional centre, participation in a Professional Development Scheme under the relevant postgraduate training body and access to a range of financial incentives. The Executive is also progressing the introduction of a single contact point for HSE agencies to obtain locum/temporary medical staff.  I have asked the Executive to reply directly to the Deputy about the number and nature of vacancies in specific hospitals.

The Oireachtas Liaison Officer for the NTA is Mr Karl Seeber who may be contacted at karl.seeber@nationaltransport.ie.  Outside the GDA, a number of public transport investment programmes will continue in 2011, for example the Railway Safety Programme, the Iarnrod Eireann Car-Park Expansion Programme, Bus Priority and Park & Ride measures in the Regional Cities and the Public Transport Accessibility Programme. The Removal of Rail Speed Restrictions Programme in Limerick is expected to be completed in 2011 and delivery will commence of 51 new Intercity Railcars for Iarnrod Eireann.RoadsNational roads construction projects are a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Sections 17 and 19 of the Roads Acts 1993 as amended, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The NRA recently provided funding allocations for national roads for 2011 to all local authorities.  I have arranged to place copies of this document in the Oireachtas Library for the information of members of the House.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, under Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.    It is intended to issue details of grant allocations to local authorities for these roads in the near future.MaritimeMy Department administers capital grant payments to harbour authorities operating under the Harbours Act 1946 in respect of priority remedial works to protect the fabric of the harbours and to facilitate their transfer to local control.

Bills for which Heads of Bill have been approved
Criminal Justice Bill 2011The purpose of the Bill is to amend the criminal law to improve certain procedural matters and strengthen Garda investigative powers. The intention is that such improvements will assist in reducing the delays associated with the investigation and prosecution of complex crime, in particular white collar crime.The Bill proposes to make more effective use of detention periods by allowing persons detained for questioning to be released and their detention suspended so that further investigations can be conducted during the suspension period.  A range of powers are proposed to require persons to produce material and make statements, as are new measures relating to how detailed information is to be provided to assist in the investigation and prosecution of complex crimes.European Arrest Warrant (Extension) and Extradition (Amendment) BillThe purpose of this Bill, which is at an advanced stage of drafting, is to give effect to the EU-Norway/Iceland agreement on surrender (extradition) by extending the application of the EAW Act to this agreement. It amends the Extradition Acts to streamline procedures and it will also enable ratification of the protocols to the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition.Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to five EU decisions:Council Decision 2009/426/JHA on the operation of Eurojust.Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA on mutual recognition of confiscation orders.Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on mutual recognition of financial penalties.Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA on judgements in absentia.Council Decision 2008/617/11 on enhancing the operation of special intervention units in crisis situations.Criminal Justice (Cybercrime) BillThe purpose of this Bill, which is at an advanced stage of drafting, is to enable ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the transposition of the EU Framework Decision on attacks against Information Systems. Consideration is being given as to whether the terms of a recent EU Draft Directive could be incorporated into the Bill.Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments BillThis Bill will provide for implementation of the Lugano Convention.Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Amendment BillThis Bill will provide for better regulation of criminal legal aid under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 and for transfer of its administration and management to the Legal Aid Board.Mental Capacity BillThis Bill will reform the law on mental capacity (taking into account the Law Reform Commission's Report on Vulnerable Adults and the Law).Sale of Alcohol BillThis Bill will codify the law relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol.Judicial Council BillThis Bill will provide effective remedies for complaints about judicial misbehaviour including lay participation in the investigation of the complaints.The Explosives Bill 2011The Explosives Bill 2011 proposes the repeal in its entirety, of the Explosives Act 1875 and its replacement with a modern statutory framework for the control of the manufacture, importation, storage, transport  and supply of explosives (for legitimate purposes only).
Bills yet to be approved
Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill (No. 1)This Bill will give effect to criminal law recommendations in the Second Interim Report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children (including recommendations of the majority of members, where agreement not achieved). A draft General Scheme has been completed.The Bill reduces age of consent from 17 to 16, introduces more objective test in relation to defences for defendants, strengthens offences by persons in authority, amends the criminal evidence act to make court proceedings less intimidating for children, and amends the law on incest to address a gender anomaly in sentencing — currently maximum sentence for males is life compared to 7 years for females.Bail BillThe purpose of the Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law and to provide for certain improvements to ensure that the bail regime can operate in as tight and effective a way as possible. The preparation of the Bill includes the examination of the extent to which greater guidance could be given to the courts on the need to protect the public against those who present an unacceptable risk of committing a serious offence if granted bail.Criminal Justice Europol (Amendment) BillThe purpose of the Bill is to give effect to a Council Decision of 6 April 2009 (2009/371/JHA) which expands the operation of Europol removing the requirement that an organised criminal structure must be involved before Europol can act.Probation Service BillThis Bill will provide a modern statement of the law governing the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system and will also give effect to the EU Framework Decision on the supervision of probation measures.Garda Síochána Act 2005 (Amendment) BillThis Bill will amend the 2005 Act when proposals to be submitted by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission have been considered and agreed.Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (No. 2) BillThis is a wider Bill to provide further protections to vulnerable persons against sexual abuse and exploitation, including amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 (e.g., risk assessment, disclosure of information to the public, amendments to strengthen provisions relating to civil sex offender orders).UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel,  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT)Ireland signed this protocol on 2 October, 2007 but has not yet ratified itIt provides for a system of visits to places of detention by both the UN Sub-Committee on Prevention (SPT) and national bodies — National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs)  — with whom the State would engage to implement recommendationsThe international inspection regime would be similar to existing Council of Europe arrangements — Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) — to which Ireland is subjectA draft General Scheme empowering the Minister to designate NPMs and a Central Co-ordinator is well developedImplementation will have resource and cost implications and an open consultation with civic society regarding the structures to be put in place is required.Criminal Law (Corporate Manslaughter) BillThe Minister's proposals for the preparation of a Corporate Manslaughter Bill were approved by the Cabinet on 14 December. A draft General Scheme has yet to be prepared. The Bill will give effect to the 2005 "Law Reform Commission (LRC) Report on Corporate Killing". The LRC's principal recommendations were for a statutory corporate manslaughter offence and a derivative individual offence of "grossly negligent management causing death". In its recent decision the Government approved the establishment of a cross-Departmental Committee to conduct a Regulatory Impact Assessment.Criminal Justice Corruption (Consolidation) BillThe law on the prevention of corruption is embodied in 7 separate, interlaced statutes starting with the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889 and including the recently enacted Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2010.  In light of recommendations from the OECD and in order to clarify the law in this area, a commitment was made to bring forward a bill to consolidate the law in this area.  The Bill may need to go further than mere consolidation to address any issues arising from consultations with the Garda Síochána on the need to streamline arrangements for reporting corruption.Legal Costs BillThis Bill will provide for the regulation and assessment of legal costs and for the establishment of a Regulator to replace the Office of Taxing Master and to give effect to Report of Legal Costs Working Group.Landlord and Tenant BillThis Bill will provide for the reform and consolidation of the law on landlords & tenants on the basis of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.Trusts BillThis Bill will provide for the reform and consolidation of the law relating to trustees in order to ensure better overview and the protection of trust assets on the basis of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.Mediation and Conciliation BillThis Bill will provide for the implementation of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which are intended to set out the principles and arrangements applicable to mediation and conciliation in civil and commercial disputes.Family Law BillThis Bill will make provision for pension adjustments in the context of separation agreements and certain other reforms of family law.Courts (Consolidation and Reform) BillThis Bill will provide for the implementation of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.Personal Insolvency BillThis Bill will provide for a new framework for settlement and enforcement of debt and for personal insolvency taking into account recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.Children Act, 2001I gave approval in principle in July 2010 to draft the heads of a Bill in respect of amendments to the Children Act, 2001. My Department is working on drafting Heads of a Bill as well as engaging with relevant stakeholders.

It was refused by the Visa Officer on the 25 January 2011 for the following reasons:1. Relationship History — The applicant had not provided evidence of a relationship being in existence prior to the visa application/marriage;2. General Policy — It is not the general policy to permit any person, whether related or not, to join or visit any person who has been granted temporary permission to remain in the State.  This case was fully examined, and all relevant facts were taken into consideration by the deciding officer.

The relevant road traffic legislation, which is a matter for the Department of Transport, provides that, during the initial period of 28 days from the date of the notice, payment is accepted at the fixed charge.  During the subsequent period of 28 days, payment is accepted at the fixed charge plus 50 per cent.  If no payment is made, the recipient is liable for prosecution for the offence alleged.  The matter then proceeds to be dealt with by the courts.  The legislation does not allow for acceptance of payment under any circumstances outside the statutory time limit of 56 days.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person referred to by the Deputy was detected exceeding the speed limit on 28 June, 2010.  A fixed charge penalty notice was issued to the person on 7 July, 2010, and delivery was effected as provided for in legislation.   I am further informed there is no indication of any difficulty with delivery of the notice.

The Government has consistently supported the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara.  Ireland has not taken a position on the future status of the territory, so long as that status is decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination.At present, the Western Sahara is a non-self governing territory. Under international law, the economic resources of a non-self governing territory may only be exploited for the benefit of the people of the territory, on their behalf or in consultation with their representatives.The Government has consistently made clear its view that any exploration and exploitation activities that proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara would be in violation of the principles of international law applicable to natural resource activities in non-self governing territories. The Government would expect that any Irish company operating abroad would have due regard to the principles of international law and the rights of the inhabitants of the territory.

The programme aims to increase participants' employability by facilitating the improvement of their skills, while also providing them with valuable work experience with an employer.  The Government is providing support for up to 5,000 places to be created under this programme, but the number of opportunities will be entirely dependent on employers applying to participate.The Department of Education and Skills have established a working group, comprising representatives from FÁS, the Higher Education Authority, the Irish Vocational Education Association and my Department, to finalise the design of the programme which is intended to be operational in the coming weeks.The work placement programme is also providing additional activation places for the unemployed.  Under this programme participants can avail of a nine month work experience placement in an organisation in the public, private or community and voluntary sector.  In Budget 2011, the Government announced that they were expanding the work placement programme so that an additional 5,000 places would be provided in the public sector, with a further 500 additional places for graduates in the private sector.  This means that the work placement programme has been expanded in total from 2,000 to 7,500 places.The rules concerning the operation of the work placement programme prohibit participating organisations displacing existing employees or using placements to fill existing vacancies.  These rules apply to all sectors including the public sector. Last year the Department of Finance wrote to all Government Departments informing them of the rules of the programme and encouraging them to participate.I launched Tús, on the 21st December 2010.  The aims of Tús are to provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  Tús will be delivered at local level by each of the Local Development Companies and by Údarás na Gaeltachta and is built on the proven architecture of the rural social scheme.Work has already begun on the roll-out of Tús across the country with the first placements expected towards the end of February when recruitment and other procedures have been completed.

Accordingly, I regularly meet with stakeholders in the tourism sector and receive submissions on various matters of importance to the sector.  For example, last September I chaired a forum comprising a wide range of tourism interests including accommodation providers, tour operators and access providers.I also have regular contact with a wide range of stakeholders as part of the Tourism Renewal Implementation Group, which I established last July and contains members from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC), the Irish Hotels Federation (IHF), and the Irish Tour Operators Association (ITOA), as well as the State Tourism Agencies.The purpose of the Group is to oversee and drive the implementation of the actions in the Framework for Action produced by the Tourism Renewal Group in its report published in October 2009.  This report drew substantially on the submissions received from all sectors of the tourism industry.  The measures contained in the framework for action are designed to support tourism in Ireland, increase competitiveness and ensure that the sector is ready for recovery and growth.  The Group has already met four times under my Chairmanship — on 6 and 20 September, 27 October and 13 December.  Its first Progress Report, summarising progress on measures under the Framework for Action has been published on the homepage of my Department's website —http://www.tcs.gov.ie.
I also received a number of submissions and met with industry stakeholders in the run up to Budget 2011.  For example, I met the Irish Hotels Federation to discuss their pre-Budget submission.  They have since welcomed the measures in Budget 2011 which will have a positive impact on the tourism industry in 2011 including the substantial revision of the Air Travel Tax, the maintenance of marketing funding to Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland and the retention of the current VAT rates applying to tourism services.In relation to employment in the sector, the Government's new Strategy and Action Plan for Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, "Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy", which was launched on 28 September last, contains targets for job creation, exports, tourist numbers and inward investment projects by 2015 and details on how the Government and its agencies will achieve these priorities and targets.  The tourism-related elements of the new Strategy draw on the robust analysis already carried out by the Tourism Renewal Group in its Report and Framework for Action.  Tourism already provides employment for approximately 190,000 people across the country and the Government aims to both maintain existing jobs and grow employment in the sector by 15,000 by 2015.Overall, I believe that Government is pursuing the right programmes and measures to support the continued development of tourism, working with the industry and the tourism agencies in order to position the sector for recovery and growth as part of the Government's wider strategy for economic renewal.  This work is being greatly assisted by remaining close to the tourism sector through the Tourism Renewal Implementation Group, which will continue to oversee and drive further action on measures to support the competitiveness and sustainability of tourism in Ireland.

Under the Sports Capital Programme (SCP), which is administered by my Department, and part funded from the proceeds of the National Lottery, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.€33 million has been provided in my Department's Vote in the 2011 Estimates to cover payments to be made from the C1 subhead, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities in respect of previously awarded grants.  It is expected that all of this funding will be paid out to sports clubs and organisations this year.As the drawdown of outstanding allocations is dependent on the timely receipt of invoices and other documentation from the grantees it is not possible to predict the exact amount of SCP drawdown from any county during a particular period of time.The figures for payments under the SCP to projects in County Kildare for each of the last four years are set out in the table:€20101,061,87020091,654,4212008687,45120071,031,964Under the Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme (LASPP) a provision of €6.65m has been made in 2011 which will be sufficient to meet existing commitments under current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.Swimming pools in Athy and Naas have benefited from LASPP funding of €3.8m each.  All of this funding has been drawn down.  The figures for expenditure under the LASPP for each of the years since 2007, for County Kildare are set out in the table below.€2010761,8432009020084,404,58020072,452,005

As well as the normal promotion of events and programmes for which they are responsible, each of our National Cultural Institutions provides Community and Outreach programmes which include targeted events for the members of the community e.g. older persons, children, families, socially disadvantaged group etc.The National Concert Hall's Learn & Explore team is dedicated to bringing the finest musicians from The National Concert Hall out into schools and communities across Ireland to deliver the best in music education. Each summer, the team organises in-service primary school teacher training which is accredited by the Department of Education and Skills as a Teacher Education Summer Course. The National Concert Hall also hosts summer camps that cater for all ages and all instruments.The National Museum of Ireland has long been a resource for primary, second and third level students and educators, providing a broad range of services — including guided tours; demonstrations and workshops; an information and resource service; professional development courses and activities for teachers.   The Museum's Education & Outreach department organises in-service courses for teachers annually.The Irish Museum of Modern Art's (IMMA) Education and Community Programme aims to foster within society an increased awareness and understanding of the visual arts by creating innovative and inclusive opportunities for people to engage with the Museum's exhibitions and programmes, both as audience members and participants. It also seeks to create opportunities for meaningful exchanges between artists and the public. The Museum's Education and Community Programme is informed by models of practice which are designed to meet the needs of specific groups and to address targeted education needs. These models are documented and evaluated and their outcomes inform a broader programme which can provide access for a wide range of people.While IMMA caters for the needs of all groups interested in using the Museum as a resource, it has also developed a number of programmes and projects intended to address the needs of specific groups, such as schools and colleges.The National Gallery of Ireland also has a range of educational and outreach programmes, i.e.:Lifelong Learning EventsChildren's & Families ProgrammeOutreach ProgrammeTeachers & Schools ProgrammeA lecture series throughout the WinterAs well as providing funding to the National Cultural Institutions my Department provides annual funding to a number of other cultural institutions which are equally important in increasing awareness in the value and benefit of cultural activities. These include the Hunt Museum, Archbishop Marsh's Library, the National Maritime Museum, the National Print Museum as well as regional and local museums throughout the country.My Department also provides funding for a number of cultural events throughout the year which are specifically designed to promote the value of our cultural heritage and cultural activities.These include events such as Culture Night, Dublin Contemporary 2011 and the Cultural Technology Grant Scheme.On Culture Night, arts and cultural organisations throughout the country, including the National Cultural Institutions, extend their opening hours to allow for increased access to the public.  In 2010, twenty one cities and towns throughout Ireland participated in the event which attracted a nationwide audience in excess of 230,000 people.Dublin Contemporary 2011 (DC2011) will be an internationally recognised and acclaimed contemporary art exhibition/event in Dublin in 2011.  The project can be broadly described as a major exhibition of leading and emerging Irish and international contemporary art spread across a number of landmark sites in Dublin city centre over a period of 8 weeks, from September 6th to October 31st   2011.  DC2011 will be the largest contemporary art event of its kind and scale ever held in Ireland and will provide a highlight for cultural tourism in Ireland on a global scale.In 2010, I launched the Cultural Technology Grant Scheme, the aim of which was to use a variety of the best new and existing technology methods to deliver a promotional, educational or information product to promote the Irish arts, culture and creative sectors. Under this initiative I provided in excess of €1 million to 25 projects which will showcase the best of our Irish art, music, culture and heritage in the most exciting, innovative and dynamic ways.  A number of these projects are now available and the remainder will be launched in the forthcoming months.   My Department will give consideration to the operation of the scheme again in 2011 having regard to the level of resources available and the competing demands for same.I believe that the most effective means to increase awareness in the value and benefit of cultural activities is to provide a broad range of events, including family friendly events, in a variety of settings.  I am confident that the Irish cultural offering in 2011 will appeal to all and will ensure that Dublin, and Ireland, maintains its reputation as a prime cultural tourist destination.

These forums involved wide-ranging and in-depth discussions and presentations on all aspects of the tourism industry, the national cultural agenda, and sports matters.  A particular emphasis was to discuss ways of maintaining employments levels in the sectors and maximising their contribution to the overall economy.As I indicated to the stakeholders at the conclusion of the consultation forums, their comments and views were much appreciated.  I also pointed out that priorities and objectives for the tourism, culture and sport sectors, including decisions on the allocation of resources, would be determined within the parameters of the resources available and the potential of the sector to contribute to national economic recovery and society development.

In accordance with motor tax legislation, in order to be taxed in the goods category, a vehicle must be constructed or adapted for use as a goods vehicle and used solely for the conveyance of goods in the course of trade or business, including agriculture.A goods vehicle which is used for private purposes at any time does not qualify for the goods rate of motor tax and must be taxed at the private rate.  This has always been the case.

Consideration is being given in the context of the acceleration of investment of mains rehabilitation to funding of associated replacement of common lead services.I have no proposals to introduce a general grant scheme to assist householders replace lead water pipes, boundary boxes or the internal lead plumbing of their dwellings, nor has the Department provided specific grant assistance in the past to carry out such works.   Local authorities may however determine that such works are eligible for funding under the Housing Adaptation Grant for Older People and People with a Disability, for private dwellings.

Tenancies in the private rented sector are governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which falls under the remit of the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  An Garda Síochána also has general powers to address anti-social behaviour.I have no plans at present to extend the remit of housing authorities to address anti-social behaviour in the private rented sector.

The Task Force aims to complete its work as soon as possible.In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations. In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  One-off costs associated with the movement of these machines were €328,363.21.   There are no ongoing rental costs in respect of the use of this property.  Costs of €552.83 were incurred in 2009 in respect of equipment to monitor the environmental storage conditions at the Gormanston premises.  A further 14 machines are held in the Custom House.The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by Returning Officers for this purpose. It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.Figures for storage costs incurred from 2004 to 2009 are included in the table.  A further €5,566 was expended in 2010 in relation to work undertaken on behalf of the Department by DTZ Sherry Fitzgerald in respect of the negotiation of local lease arrangements.

The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda Síochána, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State — in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).Where duration of absence is a factor to be considered in an application to a registration authority for a postal vote, the matter is determined on its merits by the authority involved. The last date for receipt of applications to be entered onto postal vote lists is 25 November annually. However, in the case of a general election the law provides for a period of two days following the dissolution of the Dáil in which an application for inclusion in the supplement to the postal voters list can be made.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	585	The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  ComReg's website www.callcosts.ie provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis, including County Meath.While my Department does not hold information on broadband penetration by region, ComReg publishes quarterly statistical reports on national developments in the fixed-line, mobile and broadband communications markets.These reports demonstrate the significant progress in broadband roll-out over recent years.  At the end of June 2010 Ireland had in the region of 1.48 million broadband subscriptions and narrowband connections had reduced to less than 5% of all Internet connections.  The year-on-year growth in subscriptions over the preceding 12-month period from June 2009 was over 16.5%.Broadband services are now available throughout the entire National Broadband Scheme (NBS) area.  A list of the Electoral Divisions (EDs) covered by the NBS in County Meath is provided.However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend, to formally launch a new Rural Broadband Scheme aimed at providing a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS.  This process will be technology neutral — it will be a matter for the bidders to decide which technical approach they propose in their bids.Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.NameED Reference No.ARDBRACCAN ED167002BECTIVE ED167011CASTLEKEERAN ED167016CLOGHBRACK ED167019CLONMACDUFF ED167020CROSSKEYS ED167022DRUMCONDRA ED167027KILLALLON ED167047KILLARY ED167048KILLEAGH ED167049KILLYON ED167051KILMORE ED167054KNOCKLOUGH ED167056LOUGHAN ED167058MOYLAGH ED167063RATHKENNY ED167075RATHMORE ED167076TROHANNY ED167092

However, my Department is proposing or contemplating 4 pieces of primary legislation at the present time, including the Greyhound Welfare Bill which has passed its second stage in the Seanad.There are 3 other Bills for which the general scheme has been approved, namely — Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill, Forestry Bill and Animal Health and Welfare Bill.The Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill will enable the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to make regulations providing that specified procedures carried out on animals are not restricted to veterinary practitioners or veterinary nurses.The Forestry Bill will update the Forestry Act, 1946 by reforming and updating the legislative framework relating to forestry in order to support the development of a modern forestry sector, which enshrines the principles of sustainable forest management and protection of the environment.The Animal Health and Welfare Bill will consolidate and update existing legislation in the areas of animal health and welfare, including the repeal of several extant Statutes.  The new legislation will also provide for the consolidation of responsibility for the welfare of all animals within the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	591	In the face of ever-greater concentration of demand, the grouping of supply through producer organisations (POs) is an economic necessity in order to strengthen the position of producers in the market.Accordingly, in its 2007 reform of the common organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables, the EU made further provision for financial assistance to producers grouping, on a voluntary basis, to form recognised POs under the EU Scheme of Aid for Producer Organisations in the Fruit and Vegetables Sector.The POs play a vital role in supporting Irish producers of fruit and vegetables. The strengthening of their role is a core part of the EU strategy for improving the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetable sector in the future and was one of the main recommendations for the horticultural industry in the recently published Harvest 2020 Report.   My Department continues to encourage growers to become actively involved in Producer Organisations. Payments are made annually in arrears.    Payments of €5.785m issued last year in respect of 2009 operational programmes implemented by Irish POs.Through the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, my Department provides grant aid for horticultural growers who are making capital investments in specialist plant and equipment.  The main objectives of the scheme are to improve the quality of products, facilitate environmentally friendly practices and promote diversification of on-farm activities in response to market demand. This is a competitive grant aid scheme so funding is only provided for the very best projects which will achieve scheme objectives.  Apart from improving the quality of products, investments under the scheme have also significantly extended the growing season for Irish produce.  For example, Irish strawberries are now available right into November.  The closing date for the latest round of the Scheme is Friday 18th   February 2011 and €4 million has been allocated.Because of wider concerns regarding the relationship between supermarkets and suppliers, the former Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment appointed Mr. John Travers to facilitate discussions with stakeholders in relation to the drawing up of a Voluntary Code for the Grocery Goods Sector. Mr. Travers is continuing to explore with relevant stakeholders the possibilities in relation to the development of a Voluntary Code. It is expected that Mr. Travers will report on his efforts to facilitate agreement on the terms of a Voluntary Code in the coming weeks.In relation to the importation of fresh produce from Northern Ireland, this is a private commercial matter for the company involved and one in which I have no role, provided that the produce in question complies with the EU  marketing standards in relation to quality and labelling.   My Department conducts inspections at import, wholesale and retail level to ensure compliance with these standards.In terms of fresh fruit and vegetables, Irish self sufficiency levels vary greatly depending on the product in question.  For example Ireland is well over 1000% self-sufficient in mushrooms but many fruit types can't be grown in Ireland due to our climate and hence we are totally reliant on imports for these products.  Overall Ireland is circa 85% self sufficient in vegetables (including potatoes) but the corresponding figure for fruit is much lower.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The deputy will no doubt appreciate that the primary responsibility for avoiding super levy lies with each individual milk producer, and it is a responsibility that all dairy farmers should take very seriously in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015.My priority is, firstly, to secure as much quota as possible at a national level, and, then, to ensure that as much quota as possible finds its way into the hands of active milk producers. I have had considerable success on both fronts in recent years. My negotiation of a very positive outcome to the CAP Health Check in 2008 means that, by 2014, the national milk quota will have increased by more than seven per cent compared to 2008. And my modernising approach to the implementation of milk quota policy, which has resulted in a radical overhaul of domestic legislation and the introduction of progressive distribution mechanisms such as the Milk Quota Trading Scheme and the New Entrants Scheme, has allowed historically large volumes of quota to be acquired by, or allocated to, both expanding and newly commencing milk producers.Nevertheless, I am aware of concerns that have been expressed in the sector about a rapid increase in milk production in Ireland ahead of quota abolition.  This is raising hopes for larger increases than the annual 1 per cent already agreed, or perhaps an EU-wide redistribution of unused quota, as suggested in the Deputy's question. While I have supported calls for a re-assessment of the situation at EU level in order to ensure a soft landing for all Member States, the Commission's assessment of the situation in its December 2010 report came to the clear conclusion that a revisiting of the quota elements of the Health Check agreement was not warranted, and any proposal in this regard is unlikely to attract the support of a majority of Member States.

The other four are Category 3 plants dealing with lower risk material.Six of the twelve approved MBM stores are approved to store Category 1 MBM, one for Category 2 and five for Category 3 MBM.Under the TSE Subsidy Scheme €9.67m was paid to Category 1 rendering plants in 2009, and €5.81m in 2010, to cover the cost of rendering and disposal of fallen animals.There is full time technical supervision in rendering plants by officials of my Department.  Processing plants are also validated before commercial production commences and at regular intervals thereafter.During 2009 and 2010 official veterinary inspections in rendering plants were carried out on a monthly basis. Verification inspections were carried out on an annual basis.MBM stores are selected for inspection on a planned basis, with one store in each region being inspected annually.The miscategorisation of MBM under the current controls is extremely unlikely and the planned controls carried out in 2009 and 2010 found no indication of incorrect classification.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	596	Nine plants have been approved in this country to render animal by-products (ABP) in accordance with the terms of Regulation (EC) 1774 of 2002. All of these plants operate under the supervision of my Department. Five of the plants are approved as Category 1 plants and can deal with all types of ABP, including specified risk material. The other four are Category 3 plants dealing with lower risk material.Details of the five Category 1 plants are set out as follows.Approval NumberName & Address of PremisesR910Dublin Products, Dunlavin, Co WicklowR911College Proteins Ltd., Nobber, Co MeathR915Premier Proteins, Ballinasloe, Co GalwayR919Waterford Proteins, Christendom, Ferrybank, Co WaterfordR922Ecosafe Systems Ltd., Unit 1A, Allied Industrial Estate, Kylemore Road, Dublin 10During 2010 the five Category 1 rendering plants produced 71,139 tonnes of meat and bone meal (MBM). Details of production for individual plants can not be revealed as the information is commercially sensitive.Category 1 material must generally be disposed of by incineration, with the consequence that Category 1 MBM for some years had to be exported for incineration at significant cost. In recent years however some Category 1 MBM has been used under IPPC licence as a co-fuel in a cement plant (Lagan Cement, Killaskillen, Co Meath) and I am also aware of proposals to use it as a carbon-neutral fuel to generate electricity.

The CEBs are operating three separate EGF facilities i.e. Dell EGF, Waterford Crystal EGF and SR Technics EGF and each EGF facility has its own Evaluation Committee. Each Evaluation Committee is comprised of 8 members who are drawn from a range of appropriate local representative groupings such as the participating CEBs, the Banking Sector the relevant Local Authorities, Enterprise Ireland etc.

All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.I wish to advise the Deputy that this application was refused on the 9th September 2010 on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only for highly skilled, highly paid positions or, for non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or, where there is an officially recognized scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification.Furthermore, it appeared from the P60 submitted in support of the application that the employee had not received the level of annual salary required by the previous employment permit.  The revised salary notified by the employer in support of the appeal, also fell short of the required salary level for that permit.Having examined the appeal, the Appeals Officer upheld the original decision in this case on the 17th December 2010 and the fees are in the process of being refunded to the applicant.In these circumstances, therefore, I regret that it is not possible to re-visit this application.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-01-26 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The issues raised in the details supplied refer to the former National Chairman and the former Chief Executive of an organisation.  The matter relates to a complaint made by that organisation to the Gardaí in March 1999. The Department was not a party to that complaint.The Department was informed at the time that the organisation had decided to alert the Gardaí of suspected irregularities in relation to claims submitted to the Department for funding under Measure 5 of the Small Business Operational Programme.  The organisation  advised that invoices in respect of one company in the amount of £16,500 were the subject of correspondence with the Gardaí.On 23 June 2000, the organisation wrote to the Department stating that a file was subsequently sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions who decided there were no grounds for action.  At that stage, the organisation accepted the results of the investigation and considered the matter closed.  This letter was disclosed by the Department on 26 July 2000 to the former Chief Executive under an FOI request.At no point has the Department sought to assert or maintain that any individual was guilty of wrongdoing.  From the outset, and during the intervening years, the Department has made all reasonable efforts to facilitate the former Chief Executive who has been the principal enquirer in these matters.In 2004, the former Chief Executive referred his complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Department cooperated fully with the Ombudsman's inquiry.  The Report of the Ombudsman concluded that the complaint against the Department was not upheld by the Ombudsman and that the case was closed by that Office on 28 November 2007.For the avoidance of doubt, I again affirm that the Department does not have any issue or concern to pursue with the former Chief Executive who has previously been advised to this effect in writing.  The Department has over a period of some 20 years dealt with the individual in a variety of capacities. The contacts were always of the highest probity.

The CEB's unique role positions them as a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business. The County and City of Cork is serviced by four CEBs, contact details for each individual Board can be obtained through the CEBs' national website address at www.enterpriseboards.ie. The promoter should in the first instance contact their relevant local CEB to discuss what options may be available to them and their proposed business venture. To be eligible for CEB grant support an enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people. CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise. In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.
