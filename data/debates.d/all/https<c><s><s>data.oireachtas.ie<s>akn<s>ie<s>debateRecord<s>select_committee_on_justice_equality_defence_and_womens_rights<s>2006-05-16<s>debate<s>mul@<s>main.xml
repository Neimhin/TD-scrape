          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_15">We reached amendment No. 177. The next set of amendments, which comprises amendments Nos. 177 to 178, has two elements. It provides a legal basis for the imposition of restriction of movement orders and it provides for the electronic monitoring of offenders who are subject to such an order and offenders on temporary release. I propose that restriction of movement orders, which may be accompanied by electronic monitoring where appropriate, be available to the courts as an alternative sanction to imprisonment for certain minor offences. My proposals on the monitoring of those on temporary release will allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reformto impose a condition restricting the person's movements while on temporary release and allowing for the electronic monitoring of compliance with those conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">As a sentencing tool these orders will be available to a court where a person over the age of 18 has been convicted summarily of a scheduled offence and the court views that a sentence of three months or more is appropriate. This ensures that restriction of movement orders are not used in association with offences of a very minor nature which would incur only a short term of imprisonment. The scheduled offences are lesser public order and assault type offences. The circumstances in which these types of offences are generally committed makes them amenable to a sanction restricting the perpetrator's movements. The maximum length of an order imposed by a court would be six months and it would be possible to seek a variation order.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The orders may include a curfew element that requires a person to be in a particular place for a particular period, for example, his or her home during the hours of darkness. They may also include a prohibition element which would require a person not to be in a particular place for a particular period, for example, near a specific business premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The restriction of movement orders and the restriction of movement conditions for temporary release prisoners will require the consent of the offender and of the person residing in or in charge of the place or places concerned. This might be useful to, for example, the offender's parents if he or she resides at the family home because if one has to install equipment in their home, their wishes cannot be ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">A court will only be able to make a restriction of movement order if, having regarded the offender's circumstances, he or she is deemed suitable. The court may request a written report from a probation and welfare officer for that purpose. The specifics of the order will ensure that any educational programmes in which the offender might be engaged will not be hindered. This is necessary given that the aim of these orders is rehabilitation. It is with this in mind that I am providing that an offender may not be required to be in a particular place for more than 12 hours in any one day.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The proposed condition restricting an offender's movements while on temporary release is not limited in terms of types of offences or maximum duration. That proposal will dovetail with the existing provisions of the 1960 Act on granting temporary release to prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The proposals on electronic monitoring are enabling provisions and relate to the technical issues involved in the introduction of such a system. Provision is being made for the making of regulations concerning the type of electronic device that may be used and the monitoring arrangements. It is impossible to set out in statutory form exact specifications for that kind of equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Regarding the amendments to the proposed amendments, the Labour Party's first amendment is to delete the term "summarily" in subsection (1). The current proposal is that restriction of movement orders are aimed at offenders convicted by the District Court of the offences in Schedule 3 and that they must have been convicted summarily. The effect of the amendment is to widen the scope to all convicted persons, which goes much further than I had intended. The proposal I made is adequate as it provides a satisfactory alternative means of dealing with relatively minor offenders. This would not be an appropriate way to deal with more serious offenders such as those convicted on indictment.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, in amendment No. 2, proposes to remove the provision that a person may not be required to be in any one place for more than 12 hours in a day from subsection (2). If this amendment were to be accepted a person could be confined to one place for a whole day which takes no account of ordinary requirements like going to college, work or to the shops. This amounts to house arrest. Such an arrangement would be seen as unreasonable and courts would not be happy to enforce it. There is a risk that the section would be struck down as unreasonable if this amendment were accepted and interpreted as meaning people could be subject to virtual house arrest.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Subsections (6) and (7) will give guidance to the court when it considers appropriate restrictions relating to times and places. These subsections are adequate and give nothing more than is required by way of guidance to the courts. Restriction of movement orders are alternatives to prison, are aimed at relatively minor offenders and are designed to facilitate rehabilitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Regarding the Labour Party amendment No. 3 and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment No. 4, my proposal states that a restriction of movement order may last for not more than six months. That proposal allows for orders over shorter periods; the six month limit applies where there are multiple orders — the sum of the periods may not exceed six months. I chose that period as I felt that a longer one would create new difficulties. As the likelihood of non-compliance increases the longer the period is, a relatively short period is likely to be more effective. I understand that amendment No. 3 is aimed at cases where the maximum sentence is three months. In such cases a six month restriction of movement order might seem at variance with the custodial option, however the text allows sufficient flexibility to the court and it may be the case that an offender would prefer a six month order, in any event, when compared to even a one month custodial sentence. This proposal targets relatively minor offences and the approach being adopted is satisfactory. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment No. 4 would remove any upper limit on the duration on the order and I have already give my reasons for setting an upper limit of six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">In amendment No. 5, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe proposes to amend subsection (6) by replacing "is participating" with the term "ordinarily participates". I can see some differences between the two sets of wording and I would like to hear him on that subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe also proposes a new subsection (12) in amendment No. 6 and it appears to deal with the same issue as subsection (11), that is, ensuring the person fully understands the implications of being subject to an order. Again, I would like to hear his views on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment No. 7 to the amendment is technical in nature. In amendment No. 8 to the amendment, the Deputy is proposing to add to subsection (12) a new category of persons to which movement orders are to be sent, namely, any person as the court may deem appropriate. The subsection already provides that it must be sent to the offender, the Garda and those persons authorised with monitoring compliance. I am satisfied that this appears to be a complete list and I do not know who else he has in mind for broader notification.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Amendment No. 178 in my name inserts a new section 101 that provides for electronic monitoring on restriction of movement orders. It provides that where electronic monitoring of an order is proposed, the order shall include, first, a provision making an authorised person responsible for monitoring compliance and, second, a requirement that the offender have a device attached to him or her to enable compliance to be monitored. The device may be attached continuously or for specified periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">In amendment No. 179, I propose to insert a new section 102 to provide that a court may vary an order on application by the offender, the owner or person habitually resident at the place specified in the order, the Garda or, where appropriate, the authorised person for the purpose of monitoring. The variation may substitute a place or a period of time for one already specified. In Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment No. 1 to my amendment, he proposes to amend subsection (1), which lists the parties that may apply to have an order varied, and add a new category, namely, counsel for any of the parties already listed. Subject to what he may say, I do not think it is necessary to provide that it must be done <i>in personam</i>. Anybody is entitled to move a court in any direction, either personally or through a legal representative. The Law Society might not be keen on the term “counsel” as used there.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_32">Amendment No 180 inserts a new section 103 — doubtless it was drafted by a solicitor — which makes provision in respect of more than one restriction on movement order. Subsection (1) states that where more than one restriction on movement order is in place, the cumulative period shall not exceed six months. It provides that where orders are imposed for two or more offences, they may be concurrent or consecutive, but not for more than six months in total, and that where a person is already subject to an order, a new order must be made. In the latter circumstances, the two orders may be concurrent or an addition to one another but may not run for more than six months in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Amendment No. 181, which deals with non-compliance with restriction on movement orders, provides that where, on application to a garda or a person authorised to monitor compliance with electronic equipment, the court considers that there has been a breach of the order, it may, where it is the court for the district in which the person resides, first, direct the person to comply, second, revoke the order or, third, revoke the order and deal with the case in any other way in which it could have been dealt with before the order was made. Where the court to which an application is made is not the one for the district in which the person resides, the first court may remand the person on bail to the court in the district where he or she resides.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Amendment No. 182 proposes to insert a new section in respect of the Criminal Justice Act 1951. The latter provides that cumulative sentences imposed by the District Court should not exceed two years. The maximum period of sentence for any single sentence is one year. This amendment provides that account should be taken of any period during which a restriction on movement order is in place when assessing if the maximum threshold of two years is being reached. In effect, it provides that an order is to be regarded as a sentence for the purpose of the 1951 Act. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has tabled a number of amendments to amendment No. 182.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Amendment No. 183 is designed to give documentary evidence that evidence of being or not being in a place specified in the order may be given as a statement automatically produced by monitoring equipment and accompanied by a certificate from the person authorised to monitor the electronic monitoring equipment as to an offender's whereabouts at the time in question. If an offender is recorded as AWOL in the middle of the night, there is no need for someone to sit monitoring a screen.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Deputy Ó Snodaigh proposes to amend the section by deleting subsection (1A). He wants to exclude the possible use of electronic monitoring of compliance with a restriction of movement order. The use of electronic monitoring must remain an option and my intention is to provide a legal basis for its introduction. I have not yet generated plans for its immediate roll out, other than, perhaps, on a pilot basis. We should provide for its possible use and, therefore, I am not inclined to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I am aware that concerns have been expressed by, among others, the Irish Human Rights Commission regarding the cost-effectiveness of electronic monitoring compared to supervision by the probation and welfare service. Those concerned have also queried whether proportionality is present, given the interference entailed in electronic monitoring. I recognise these as valid concerns and they will be considered if electronic monitoring is introduced. For the moment, however, the Bill merely provides the basis on which we can move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">We must be mindful of a wider range of concerns including the alternatives — in many cases prison — and the need to protect the wider community. I would make the point to the Irish Human Rights Commission that it is true that this provision has implications for human rights in respect of freedom of movement. If however, the alternative is imprisonment that too, will have implications for freedom of movement and much more. Human rights do not apply only to the offender, members of the community also have such rights. There is a balance in respect of human rights that is at issue in these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">The purpose of amendment No. 184 is to insert a new section 107 on the temporary release of prisoners. Subsection (1) of the new section provides that a direction by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to temporarily release a prisoner may be subject to a restriction of movement condition. The condition may be monitored electronically. Subsection (2) states that the restrictions may include provision that the person should or should not be in a particular place at particular times. Subsection (3) deals with the owner or occupier of a place where the person is to be at a particular time and that they must consent to that condition. Subsection (4) states that where electronic monitoring is provided for, the Minister's direction shall include provision for an authorised person to monitor compliance. Subsection (5) states that the prisoner must agree to the condition, however, failure or refusal by the prisoner to agree does not confer any entitlement to temporary release on any other terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendments No. 1 and 4 to amendment No. 184 seek to remove the possibility of electronic monitoring of compliance. I do not accept that proposition, as is clear from what I have already said. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe proposes to amend subsection (2) by providing that a person may not be required to be in one place for more than 12 hours, save in exceptional circumstances. That issue has been discussed already.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Amendment No. 5 to the amendment was tabled by both Labour and Fine Gael and proposes to delete the new subsection (5). This subsection requires the prisoner to accept the condition of the monitoring of movement, but refusal to accept the condition does not confer any entitlement to release. This refers to people in custody under consideration for temporary release. The Minister is entitled to attach conditions to that release in the interest of public safety and does so under existing arrangements. If the amendment is accepted, we will, in effect, give prisoners the option of accepting or rejecting any conditions. It amounts to giving prisoners a veto on the conditions under which they are released.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">The purpose of amendment No. 185 is the insertion of a new section 108, which provides for the 1960 Act to operate on the basis of documentary evidence concerning breach of conditions of temporary release. Amendment No. 186 adds to the provisions of the 1960 Act whereby conditions may be attached to temporary release and extends it to the provisions of this piece of legislation. Amendment No. 187 will allow the Minister to make regulations on the type of devices to be used and on the conditions of temporary release. Amendment No. 188 allows the Minister to make arrangements, including those of a contractual nature, for the monitoring of compliance with restriction of movement orders, temporary release conditions or both.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_49">There are a few general issues that arise. Restriction of movement orders are not new. However, electronic monitoring is new. There are refinements we can make in respect of restriction of movement orders. The Minister has rightly captured the idea of a restriction of movement order as being a sentence and, for the purpose of calculating the maximum sentence, it would be calculated as such because that would be fair and real.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">There are individual issues such as the notion of confining people to an unreasonable place for an unreasonable period, a matter we can tease out in detail. I want now to tease out the issue of restriction of movement orders versus custodial sentences. My fear is not that they would not be used but that they would be used too regularly because they would not be perceived by the courts as representing custodial sentences when, in fact, that is their very nature. Such orders are similar to the restriction orders, under which people were not allowed to leave their homes, that obtained in the past in South Africa. They should not be used overmuch. I would be much happier with a restriction order that kept people away from places of danger, places where they have done injury to others or places where they might previously have intimidated individuals. That is less of a trampling on people's rights than, for example, a requirement for them to be at home for long periods, which is a different kettle of fish.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I wish to ask two questions. How does the Minister intend to convey to the Judiciary that this type of sentence has implications for and restricts an individual's freedom of movement, a freedom which is very important and cannot be upset without very serious cause? My second question relates to the use of electronic tagging and the data that will become available as a result. Obviously, there will not be an individual watching a screen day and night but there will clearly be an established pattern of movement that might throw up matters that have nothing to do with the criminal justice system but that might involve social or personal issues for the individuals concerned. What safeguards does the Minister propose to introduce to ensure that an individual's movements will be monitored for the sole purpose of preventing the commission of a crime or for restriction, as authorised by a court?</p>

If a Minister comes forward with an implementation programme, it will probably be a pilot programme that will be extended by degrees. Restriction of movement is fairly easy to effect. Electronic tagging will require specialised resources to be applied. It will require quite a degree of education not only of the Judiciary but also of the legal community, the Department, the probation and welfare service and many others before the regulations can be rolled out as an effective system. It will not just be made available one morning for everybody to make what they can of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">On the issue of privacy, I agree with Deputy Howlin that it would be wrong if people carrying out surveillance used it for their own private purposes. However, I do not want to be overly restrictive in regard to its potential use. If somebody who was subject to a restriction of movement order and was electronically tagged for a public order offence and gave alibi evidence that he or she had been at home all night, I would not want potential use of surveillance to be so narrowly confined that it could not be used to establish that the person was lying.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">Yes. The average period spent on home detention was 45 days at a cost of £1,300 per curfew. That amounts to £880 per month. It was thought that this contributed to a resource saving when compared to the cost of keeping people in prison, which amounted to £63.4 million in a year. The scheme was estimated as having a net effect of potentially reducing the prison population by 1,950 prison places over the first 12 months of its operation. The British Exchequer calculated that it had made a profit by its introduction of £36.7 million. I hope nobody will take offence at this, but I would take that with a grain of salt. How do we know that in every case a prison sentence would definitely have been handed down and that all such sentences would have been served? It is a notional calculation.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I know from listening to BBC Radio 4 that a fair number of crimes were committed by people who were under the supervision of the probation service in the UK. I presume the same applies in this instance. Since the commencement of the country-wide programmes in 1999, it has been used most frequently in respect of the home detention curfew, that is, early release from prison. Of the 201,960 offenders who have been made subject to electronic monitoring, 111,000, or 55%, were the subject of early release and a further 30% were the subject of adult curfew orders issued by the courts. I can supply the Deputies opposite with these figures.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I have a copy of a press release relating to a report, Electronically Monitored Curfew Orders: Time for a Review, which was published last year. This report was produced in the UK by the National Association of Probation Officers, NAPO. The latter found that tagging offenders costs twice as much as supervision by a member of the probation service and that even though not keeping an offender in prison saves money, more would probably be saved if the probation service were properly funded. That is one of the major criticisms of the system here.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">The success of the probation and welfare system has long been championed for its success in ensuring that some people do not reoffend. It is obviously not totally successful, but neither is the prison system.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">One of the other findings of the UK report is that electronic monitoring does not reduce reoffending. The private security companies that administer electronic schemes do not routinely follow up violations by individual offenders. The UK Government pays private tagging companies approximately three times the cost for each offender monitored. If the state authorities in the UK ran the system, it might be cheaper than outsourcing it. We do not know that for definite because the Minister has not produced a regulation dealing with the practicalities of that. The biggest problem I have with this is that we do not know what the practicalities are, namely, who will run the system and how many orders will be made. As the Minister stated, some District Court judges might think the system is the greatest thing since sliced bread and overuse it. That is not the reason it is being introduced. It is meant to be an addition to the existing system. My preference would be to properly fund the probation and welfare service in the first instance. If, having done that, problems remain, we could then examine the use of electronic tagging. We are discussing the matter, but most Deputies do not understand how it works, what is involved, whether there are ways in which the system can be evaded or whether it is foolproof. If we going to invest a great deal of money, time and effort into something, we want to ensure that it will work.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">If, after the passage of this Bill, we are dependent on regulations in respect of which we do not have a say, we need some detail regarding those regulations and the practicalities of how the system will work. We will also require some information regarding outsourcing so that when the Minister decides to test the system in the future we will know where we stand. The Minister has obviously delved deep into this and has some pilot schemes planned in the event of the Bill being passed. More detail is required. That is the reason for some of my amendments. I could go through them, but the Minister already outlined their content.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_74">I wish to make a few general points. This will save me the bother of repeating them when we come to deal with the individual amendments I have tabled. I am very much in favour of the idea of restriction of movement supported and monitored by electronic tagging. I see it as an instrument available to the courts. I do not see it as a restriction on civil liberties. The greatest restriction on civil liberty is placing somebody in custody. I see electronic tagging as an option that can be availed of to avoid placing somebody in custody in order that they can, in general, remain free but subject to certain controls. In that context, I see it as having a substantial role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">I have read up on the experience in Canada, New South Wales, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. I accept it is not a perfect system but it has major advantages if a court decides that somebody needs to be restricted but that it is not in his or her interests to be put in prison. Putting young people in prison often does more harm than good. However, such persons must be made to accept responsibility for their misdeeds and encouraged to follow a straighter path. I do not see electronic tagging as something that reduces recidivism but as an additional instrument available to the courts. We have it in respect of those convicted of an offence. I would like to see it available as an additional instrument for use by judges as a condition for the granting of bail if there are concerns regarding the commission of crime and so on. This is not provided for in the Bill, despite some reports to the contrary.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">From the point of view of cost, I am not in the business of arguing the issue of public versus private. It would be inappropriate today, given that all the trains in the country have stopped. I have no ideological hang-ups in that regard. If a service can be publicly provided efficiently, that is fine with me. I say this as a regular user of trains.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">On how electronic tagging is done in other countries, particularly the United Kingdom, it is generally outsourced. If there is a breach, there is notification to the police which then acts. I accept there is a substantial cost. In contrast, there is the cost of a prison place which can vary from €1,000 to €5,000 a week as against £880 sterling per month in the United Kingdom for electronic monitoring. That is the comparison that occurs to me. I very much support the introduction of the empowerment provisions from the point of view of both restriction of movement and the monitoring of same. I will be happy to go through the sections whenever the Minister wishes to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">To return to amendment No. 97, I have no problem in principle with the Minister's proposal. The amendment relates more to good order. There are definitions in the amendment and further definitions at the end of the section. I am advised that it would be more sensible to consolidate all of the definitions and put them all in one place at the beginning of the section. My amendment is merely a drafting proposal for the sake of good order. There is no more I need say about it. If the Minister wishes, he may leave it to the Parliamentary Counsel to have a look at it.</p>

It is not beyond the ability of the Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with ministerial regulations. Those requiring scrutiny could be dealt with, while those requiring minor amendments in regulations could be quickly addressed. The Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny of the Joint Committee on European Affairs examines a large amount of legislation. Advisers look at the material put before the sub-committee and take decisions as to whether it requires more detailed examination. The Dáil or Seanad can refer material to a committee without debate. The Opposition will always complain but at least the committee system can examine it. I try to introduce a standard amendment on this issue in most justice legislation.</p>

Why should the court in that situation remand someone on bail if he or she has a prison sentence that has been suspended on condition of good behaviour?

I do not want there to be a suggestion that I am making this proposal to be more macho. A more practical point occurs to me. On the face of it, it sounds very sensible to allow the court to make an order requiring a person to be in a place for a period of not more than 12 hours per day. Given that a day includes night time, we are talking about allowing the court to make an order covering the period between 10 p.m. and 10 a.m. I take it the order can relate to any period of the day. It occurs to me that some people who get into trouble do so during specific parts of the week such as weekends. Therefore, a judge might be inclined to restrict the movements of a person who is getting into bother every weekend. Such a restriction might apply from Friday night to Sunday morning, for example. I have proposed this amendment to the amendment to give the court a further option; it should not be totally restricted.</p>

I would like to speak about amendment No. 3 to the amendment which has been proposed to make the point that restriction orders should not be a made for periods of time longer than the duration of custodial sentences. When the Minister referred to that matter, he said it was different. I am not sure that is the case. That one could be monitored for six months in respect of an offence for which the maximum term of imprisonment is three months seems like an odd suggestion. I suggest a restriction on movement order may be made for any period of not more than "the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence concerned, or 6 months, whichever is greater". That is a more reasonable and just construction to put on the serious matter of restriction orders of this kind.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">Amendment No. 5 to amendment No. 177 relates to the proposed section 100(6) which states the court should have regard to certain matters when it is determining "the period or periods during which the offender shall be in a specified place or places". It seems the manner in which this provision is phrased means the court will have to take into account the "circumstances of the offence of which the offender has been found guilty and any educational course, training, employment or other activity in which the offender is participating". I understand the thinking behind this. I would be very anxious that any effort by the offender to improve his or her education would be taken into account when making an order. I am bringing this forward for consideration by the Minister or the Parliamentary Counsel.</p>

          <p eId="para_288">On reflection, this is a belt and braces amendment. It is very important that the offender is aware of the full import of the order.

          <p eId="para_314">The probation officers were making the point and quoting statistics from the Home Office. In cases where judges would use the probation service they now have the option of electronic tagging. The best way to measure if an offender is complying with an order is by engaging with the probation and welfare officer who will monitor the situation. An electronic device does not do this. All it requires is that the person remain indoors; some offenders may even prefer this as no punishment is involved. I am against electronic tagging at this stage as I do not think a case has been made and we do not have sufficient details to make an informed decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">I agree the cost implications are slightly conjectural. As I am mindful of the economic implications, it is certainly not a zero cost proposal in some respects. In regard to arguments based on statistics, I was in Lansdowne Rugby Club watching a match on Sunday.

          <p eId="para_316">I do not have the principled objection Deputy Ó Snodaigh has to this amendment, but he is correct to this extent. No one has practical experience of how electronic tagging might work. I am, therefore, grateful to the Minister for giving us his briefing note. I am certainly a lot less convinced that it is a practical solution. Two forms of electronic tagging are on offer, one of of which is the GPS tracking system which is affected by tall buildings, low clouds and tall trees, which would seem to rule out much of the countryside. I would be interested in hearing the Minister's views on its reliability. The other option, if not the GPS tracking system which I presume would be the more useful of the two, is to prevent people returning to the places where they previously engaged in serious mischief in order to intimidate or harass others. The easier option is to provide for confinement to home, although that would be a lot less valuable and less acceptable. Is enforcement of a home curfew the only practical option on offer?</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I suggest Deputy Ó Snodaigh not get too excited about this provision. Legislation introduced 15 or 20 years ago provided for the introduction of the electronic monitoring of Garda interviews, a system now used in approximately 96% of specified places.</p>

Rather than walk away completely from this, I thought it better to leave it on the Statute Book in the hope the GPS system would be improved and costs would come down.

I suggest exceptional circumstances should be taken into account.

If one can make a convincing case to a judge that one was in one's bed all night and one has no idea why the machine suddenly indicated one was elsewhere, one will be fine. We will have to abandon the non-satellite based technology completely if we decide that its automatic recording means nothing. What would be the point in having such a system in such circumstances? We would have to employ somebody who is a credible witness to engage in monitoring 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, as suggested by Deputy O'Keeffe's party leader. Even then we would have to consider whether what was being monitored was reliable. If we use a GPS-based system, that is one thing — someone could say he or she monitored a signal two miles from where the person should be. If we use a system based on the distance from a device in one's house which is connected to one's telephone, however, that is a different matter. If we do not make provision for that device's recording of the absence of the electronic monitor to be admissible in any shape or form, we might as well forget the whole system because its findings would not be provable in any shape or form.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I have not exactly been working out a detailed model during the cooling and descending soufflé of enthusiasm for this measure on my part. There are two methodologies — the GPS and a domestic device that measures distance or absence. Any decision on which of the two models will be used will depend on which of them is cheaper and more reliable. If we are to lay out big bucks on this, to use a colloquialism, we will have to ensure it is reliable and good value for money.</p>

Also, we do not own or control the machines, another argument against the GPS system. Another aspect of the issue is that of telephone lines and so on.</p>
