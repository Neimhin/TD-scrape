I thank them for their attendance. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I also advise them that their opening statements and any other document they have submitted to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I ask everyone, including those in the Visitors Gallery, to turn off their mobile phones if they have not done so thus far. I invite Professor Rafter to make his presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to meet today. I am delighted to have been nominated by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to serve as chairman of the Arts Council. I very much look forward to starting in the role shortly. I will be the tenth person to hold this position since the council was established under the Arts Act 1951. It is fair to say no organisation plays a more important role in supporting the arts in Ireland than the Arts Council. This position was set out in the original legislation in 1951. It was reaffirmed in the 1973 Act and again in the 2003 Act. As head of the school of communications at Dublin City University, I currently lead Ireland's largest university centre for media and communications. It has almost 1,000 students and was recently rated amongst the top 200 globally in the subject areas. I was previously head of the department of film and media at Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT, Dún Laoghaire. Prior to 2008, I held senior editorial positions with a number of media companies, including RTÉ and The Irish Times, during a 14-year career as a political journalist. More recently, I have added significant experience as an independent non-executive director. Until 2019, I served two terms on the board of Dublin Bus, where I was also a member of the audit and risk committee. I have served on the boards of Oxfam Ireland and the Galway International Arts Festival. The latter produces one of Europe's leading arts festivals as well as developing and producing new work that tours nationally and internationally. I have experience working in the role of chairman, including as chair of the expert advisory committee of Culture Ireland, which has responsibility for promoting Irish arts worldwide, and as chair of the compliance committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. While serving in these roles, I deepened my understanding of governance processes through ongoing training, including at the Law Society of Ireland and the Institute of Directors. In accepting the position of chair of the Arts Council, I have resigned from a number of the aforementioned roles to remove any possible conflicts of interest. My involvement and interest in the arts sector arises in part from my role in the education sector, my involvement with Culture Ireland and having been a board member of Galway International Arts Festival but also from my long-standing personal interest in the visual arts, theatre, literature and film. In my previous career in the media, while I primarily worked as a political journalist, I also produced and presented a number of radio documentaries on visual artists. Going back a little farther, or longer than a little farther, I originally trained as an economist. My final year undergraduate project was an econometric study of the prices of the paintings of Jack B. Yeats, the findings of which I probably cannot recall. At that time, I was also a volunteer in a community radio station in Dublin City, Anna Livia, where I worked on the station's arts programme. In preparing for today, I read the Oireachtas debates on the original arts legislation from 1951. In a Second Stage debate in the Seanad, one Member told the House:The definition of artist nowadays is a man with long hair or a woman with short hair; they seem to need no other qualifications than that. When I see pictures exhibited by a lot of modern artists I wish that we had not any modern art. They are not painting; they are not pictures. If anything at all, they are a puzzle.There is little in this contribution I would agree with.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	Before the suspension, I referred to a debate on arts legislation in the Seanad in 1951 when one Member referred to contemporary art as being a puzzle. In a sense, it should be. Art, be it a painting, a poem, a dance or a musical composition, should puzzle. It should challenge us as people, make us reflect, think and inspire us. I am a great admirer of the work of Michelle Rogers, a wonderful painter from County Louth who now lives between New York and Rome. In 2016, she was invited to sketch the signatories of the Paris Agreement on climate change at the United Nations. In her drawings she sought to capture the hands of the 175 national representatives who signed the climate accord. Michelle Rogers said of this work:It was quite painful to do because it took hours, even though each individual signing took two or three seconds. I wanted to draw every hand that I could.The outcome was quick drawings of the signatories' hands. It has been said they look in a way like a flock of birds. It is art that captures history. One of the successes of the Arts Council over the past 70 years has been in ensuring recognition for the critical importance of the artist in society, as well as acknowledging the intellectual, creative and imaginative contribution artists make to Irish life. The Arts Council works tirelessly to ensure artists are supported in all aspects of their artistic practice and at all stages in their careers. Individual artists are supported through a range of schemes, including bursaries, projects, Aosdána and the Next Generation award. However, the reality is that being an artist is a difficult and precarious life. Despite the many available supports through the Arts Council, more needs to be done to support the living and working conditions of artists from performing to creative artists. The Arts Council will have more to say about this in the coming months. In those Oireachtas debates in 1951, it was originally proposed that the amount of money provided for the Arts Council would be limited to £20,000 per annum. Thankfully, following discussion in the Dáil, the financial provisions in the legislation were changed to ensure no ceiling was put in place to the amount of money that would be granted to the Arts Council. The council was also to be independent in allocating its funding. The then Taoiseach, John A. Costello, noted this represented a fundamental principle in the legislation. He said, "art and all works connected with artistic activities, while being encouraged to the greatest possible extent by the State, should never be controlled by the State". In the period since those words were uttered, Ireland's international reputation as a creative country has been built on long-standing State investment in both artists and arts organisations overseen by successive Arts Councils. A small grant to a fledgling theatre company in Galway in the 1970s supported the development of a world-renowned theatre powerhouse that is the Druid Theatre Company. A bursary in the 1980s to a young emerging novelist named Anne Enright helped to lead to a Booker prize winner and the inaugural laureate for Irish fiction. Some years ago, Anne Enright wrote about the lessons of being a writer. She had heard of people taking a year off to write a novel. She thought: I worry that a year might not be enough. You must fail as a writer for much longer than that ... before you know what failure is and what use you might make of it.She admitted that she did not realise that when her first book fell apart, every book falls part. As she put it, that is the gig of the artist. It is remarkable that from such struggles great work is frequently created. At the Arts Council, novels are not written, poetry is not crafted and dance is not created. As a State body, the Arts Council, as a body corporate, is imbued with a passionate love for, dedicated commitment to and a deep experience of all the art forms. It disburses public money, provides expert advice and delivers practical support. Transparency and accountability are two significantly important values in all this work. Key to the success of the Arts Council in delivering on its role is its capacity to work in partnership across government with other partners and stakeholders, and, in particular, with the local authorities. Partnership is important. Paul Durcan is one of my favourite poets. I was still a university student when he published his collection, Crazy About Women, which arose from an invitation from the National Gallery of Ireland to write poetry inspired by the gallery's collections. On my desert island list of items to bring, the first book would be Crazy About Women. It is a work of considerable beauty which reminds me always of the value of partnership. I also strongly believe in public access to the arts. Everyone in society should be able to have the unique personal experience that comes from the arts - of being inspired, challenged and confronted by the work of our artists. People should be able to enjoy the arts in their local communities. Public access is central to the remit of the Arts Council, as is a strong commitment to providing experience and practice in different art forms for people across all of Ireland. That commitment is seen in Arts Council support to over 48 local arts centres all across the country. The positive impact of this type of activity is evident in Arts Council funding last year for more than 170 festivals attended by 500,000 people. However, there are still communities for whom access to the arts continues to be a challenge for reasons of socio-economics, location, gender or disability. Working to eliminate these barriers is and will continue to be a central priority for the Arts Council. Priority must be given to ensuring that everyone living in Ireland has a sense of ownership of publicly funded art and that the art they encounter is relevant to contemporary society and its people. As chair designate of the Arts Council, I again thank the committee for inviting me to this meeting. I look forward to taking up my role formally and to engaging positively with the committee in the future and discussing many of the issues in this space with it again.

He has a considerable background in communication, writing, politics and media. As he mentioned, he also has an interest and background in arts from his radio work. As a quasi-outsider coming in, on what areas of the arts does he believe we must concentrate further? He mentioned some of them but perhaps he could elaborate. Should the Arts Council have a role outside its State role of acknowledging the arts and gifting financing and platforms to projects and people? Is it a little stuck where it is? Would Professor Rafter like to see changes? He stated that being an artist was a difficult life. Many artists have appeared before us, starting with a lot of actors from the Abbey Theatre to discuss what was happening there. Many of those with backgrounds in film and the arts tell us that it is not a full-time job or something that people can take up as a career. Professor Rafter mentioned that the Arts Council might discuss that matter in future. Will he elaborate a little? He might not wish to say too much yet, as the council might not have something worked out.

If he had a magic wand, what is the first thing he would do? Arts is about magic and creating the other in people. Regarding third level education and STEAM, which is science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, plus the arts, is there anything that Professor Rafter has seen in his travels or in his reading about other countries that, while I am not in the business of copying, he might like to see paralleled in Ireland? These are general questions and there is more to what Professor Rafter wants to do. They are also magic questions, in the sense that he has not sat down in the job yet. This is just to give him a bounce.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	I have not sat down to chair a board meeting yet. I am chair designate and I wanted to do the committee the courtesy of this being my first public outing. There will be a number of board meetings later this month, which will be an opportunity for me to get my feet under the table and get a sense of things, but I will not give the committee a long list and say that I will do this, that and the other. Rather, mine will be a watch, listen and see approach. I have had the benefit of being on the board of the Galway International Arts Festival and of chairing Creative Ireland, which has given me a good sense of the sector and the various issues. The Senator asked about the focus. Culture Ireland held a conference in January attended by individuals from all of the sectoral interests involved. I will tell the committee about something I have picked up, namely, that this is about the role of the artist, ensuring a fair and equitable working wage for artists - from the performing artist to the creative artist - and supporting them through their careers. To merge a number of the Senator's questions, doing something in that regard in order that people can have time and space will be one of the issues. I have had the benefit of reading some of the transcripts of the committee's meetings. Ms Garry Hynes appeared before it this year while it was preparing its report on arts matters. She talked about allowing art to be made. The focus will be in that space. Regarding public access, it is important that publicly funded art be available to all throughout the country. The Arts Council is a national institution with significant regional reach. It is involved in funding the education sector, including schools, as well as arts centres and various festivals. On the magic wand question, I will not surprise the committee with my answer - it will be the funding model. Like all public bodies, the Arts Council suffered significantly post 2008. That year, its funding was €85 million, but it decreased to €56 million. There was a generous increase in the last budget, though, and funding is back at €75 million. Working with my colleagues on the council, its staff and the director, one of my objectives as chair will be to show that this is money well spent. Ms Hynes referred to the "act of imagining" and being challenged and inspired. That does not come without investment. If I had a magic wand, I would use it on the budget and ensure that, over the five-year period that I hope to be chair of the Arts Council, the budget increased significantly above its current level. That would allow us to do everything else the Senator mentioned - recognising the role of the artist and the artist's career; putting art throughout the country; and supporting art centres. Regarding the STEAM and STEM debate, the humanities are very important in terms of the ability to think, inspire and communicate. We must not lose sight of their value. It was the late Mícheál Ó Súilleabhaín who said there was no metric for the priceless. Sometimes, we need to recognise the huge value that the arts provide to Irish society. That does not come without investment.

I will ask Professor Rafter two questions. He may not be able to expand on them but we will give them a shot anyway. Being frank and honest, does he see any duplication in or conflict between the roles and work of Creative Ireland and the Arts Council? If so, does that distract or take away from what the Arts Council is trying to do? My second question relates to the Arts in Education Charter. Does Professor Rafter intend to follow up the proposals in that document regarding the local arts and education partnerships? Is he an advocate of such partnerships and does he intend to deliver on them and the marriage, as it were, of the Arts Council, the ETBs and the local authorities?

I will judge that as I become more familiar with the role but there is a good, open relationship between the Arts Council and Creative Ireland.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	No, I do not see a problem. I see two organisations. The Arts Council, under statute, has a specific remit to promote and encourage the arts. Creative Ireland is a time-specific programme of activities, particularly the Creative Schools initiative where it works in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and the Arts Council. There is a great deal of activity in the arts space that the Deputy and her colleagues know-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	I am not being evasive. In terms of the briefings I have had in recent weeks and in preparing for today, the Arts Council is involved in a huge amount of activity. Part of the role of an incoming chairman is to watch, listen and see. I might not have all the answers and the detail today that I would have if I had been 12 or 18 months in the role. There are various organisations in this area but the Arts Council is the most important and has been for nearly 70 years. It is the premier, dominant organisation and it has the largest reach.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	The Arts Council is significantly involved in the education sector. I referred earlier to the value of partnership. The partnership with the Department of Education and Skills has developed over the past number of years. There are 300 schools involved in the Creative Schools initiative. That is a project in which the Arts Council will continue to be involved. The Arts Council cannot work alone. It works through the local authorities and with the line Department. It is very important that we are not operating in silos, so those partnerships are vital to deliver the ultimate objective for the arts community and for the public in terms of their access.
#FintanWarfield	unknown-#FintanWarfield-party	unknown-#FintanWarfield-dob	unknown-#FintanWarfield-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	35	I congratulate Professor Rafter on his appointment. One of the issues that has arisen relates to the funding model and the individual artist. According to the Arts Council, Theatre Forum, the 400 artists or people involved in the arts, the Abbey Theatre and Visual Artists Ireland, the average wage of an artist is between €12,000 and €13,000. As funding increases, as we might expect it to, we are faced with the choice of whether to continue to support projects that do not raise the living standards, security or income of artists. Previously, in arts policy or a portfolio relating to the arts, the Arts Council funded theatre companies and projects. What if we had a conversation about a living wage in circumstances where the council gives the money to an individual artist? Perhaps the artist has to earn €5,000 to €8,000 per year in his or her own right, but he or she would be compensated up to a living wage. Whatever income was earned, the lower level of compensation would be paid by the Arts Council and at the guaranteed level, that is, the living wage, no compensation would be paid by the State. That would essentially recognise and reward the unrecognised time that artists spend on their work and address the poverty levels in the sector. An income of €12,000 or €13,000 means someone is living in poverty. We are having a conversation about poverty. Does does Professor Rafter consider that to be a viable funding option?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	The Senator is entirely correct about wage levels. The Arts Council's strategic plan, Making Great Art Work, refers to supporting artists through their careers and to fair and equitable payment for the work they do. This issue has obviously been in the public domain recently. It is an issue that I, as chairman of Culture Ireland, heard about and discussed with individual artists. As already stated, it must be addressed. Aosdána is in place for creative artists and the members receive a stipend of approximately €17,000 per year. However, there are gaps, particularly in the performing arts area. Somebody could be working for a number of months and he or she might be on television so one might think the person is doing very well, but then there is no work for the rest of the year. That is a gap. It is something that, as incoming chairman of the Arts Council, I would like to discuss. I have discussed it with the director already. It is something we should be and will be examining. The Senator is correct - it is about ensuring that in those periods when there is no work people can continue their practice, be that on the stage, on the screen or in the visual arts. I am aware that a report the Senator published a number of years ago raised some of these issues. I put two issues in my opening statement. One is about the role of the artist, from performing artist to creative artist, and the second is about public art so "Yes" is the answer. Obviously, if more money becomes available to the Arts Council, it will be in a position to do more things. The existing schemes can be expanded and new schemes can be considered.
#FintanWarfield	unknown-#FintanWarfield-party	unknown-#FintanWarfield-dob	unknown-#FintanWarfield-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	37	It is immensely important if we want to ensure it is not just a playground for the privileged and to ensure the health and well-being of artists. It is possible that more and better work would be created by individuals. One is then faced with an argument as to why a lone parent in any community in Dublin should not be given the same. This conversation is happening. Social welfare would be separate from that. I encourage Professor Rafter and Ms McBride to reach out to other Departments and have those conversations. Popular music arises time and again. It is something separate that is not covered by the Arts Council. Perhaps our guests could discuss that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	38	The 2003 Act specifies what the areas of activity are in terms of defining arts, but it can be broader than that. I have read and seen the discussions about other art forms that are not currently covered. I have a list of things on which to ask questions. As chairman, I will work with my 12 colleagues on the council so I am not in a position to impose, but there are issues ranging from a living working wage to the different art forms that I want to discuss with the other council members to see where we will go in the next period of activity for the Arts Council. The Senator's reference to popular music is not the first time I have heard it. It is on the list with regard to whether it is somewhere we should also be expanding the reach. Much of it comes back to looking at the budget and a bigger budget. Last year's increase was significant, but it is still not back to where it was in 2008.Every organisation wants to return to where it was in 2008. Where more resources are available, investing in the arts a small amount of money relative to the overall national budget would allow the type of issues the Senator outlined to be addressed. The arts should be brought into communities. Not just the privileged enjoy the arts. Some 50 national tours were supported by the Arts Council last year and travelled throughout the country, where 300,000 people attended and enjoyed the performances. As I outlined, there are 170 festivals with 500,000 people. The Arts Council is in every community, as its funding, but with a larger budget, there could be a larger impact and more could be done.

Culture is created in homes and schools, and most of it happens outside of the reach of the Arts Council.

I am interested in the arts and the elderly, not least because I am getting older. I am also interested in the arts and the disadvantaged, which has been mentioned. As Professor Rafter will know, I spent 25 years working at Dublin City University. I know what the community means there and what the arts mean to the community. I refer also to the arts' relationship with both health and equality. Something which the Arts Council might like to consider along with the thousand other matters it will have to consider is that there should be a Department of the arts. It is such a significant area, as I have always said. The categories include art, drama, theatre, dance, music, language, performance and media. One can start with puppetry and end with Picasso or the Prokofiev ballet, "Romeo and Juliet", that took place the other day. The Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations is in represented here. While it is not in competition with the Arts Council, it and the natural environment have to vie for attention, whereas language and perhaps the arts are more comfortably placed. The Arts Council might consider that because it could make more noise in a cultural way. It will also allow the council's budget to be extended, although it might not lead to a separate Department being created. There once was a Department with responsibility for the arts, culture and language, which would give independence to all the aspects the Arts Council outlined and allow for extensions. The Arts Council might consider making more noise in that regard if it believes it is a good idea. The arts should also be considered in the various Departments because the matter is so integrative. The Arts Council described it as a partnership but it is so integrative.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	41	I am open to hearing all advice. I do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Capital expenditure is a matter for the Department. Through the Project Ireland 2040 programme, a figure not shy of €500 million will be invested in national cultural institutions such as the National Library, the National Archives and the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork. It is a mixture of spending spread across the Department. The Arts Council, on the other hand, is responsible for current expenditure. The Senator is entirely correct about disability and disadvantage. Some people experience barriers to access and, as demographics change and the population greys in its age profile, we need to be conscious of that. There will be more people, they will live longer and, one hopes, their ability to enjoy that time will mean they will be able to visit national institutions such as the National Gallery or the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork to see great works of art. We need to be conscious of the facilities that will be available for people. As I mentioned, disability and disadvantage are on the radar.

It is also about the integrative aspect. In the case of the McAuley Place for the elderly in Naas, a creative rather than medical model was used. We must reach that standpoint. A creative model needs to be used and everything will flow from that. I wish the Arts Council the best of luck. It has a tremendous challenge but it is a great feast showing what is great about Ireland. The council's representatives will not be stuck with us preparing legislation so boring that, at times, it could tie one down to a bed.

I would like the Arts Council to continue the relationship with the committee that has begun today. While this particular committee may not always exist, a committee dealing with the arts will remain. Whether or not we are here in future incarnations, at least once a year, Professor Rafter and Ms McBride should appear before the committee to explain progress or the lack thereof. It would be useful for us because, as Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell noted, the committee's remit is vast and we bounce from one area to another. It would help, therefore, if we were focused by the Arts Council appearing before us once a year. Moreover, it would allow the council to see the committee as a vehicle through which it can express frustrations with the system or whatever it wishes. It should continue to appear before us when its annual report is published and use that as the vehicle.  Chun críochnú, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis na finnéithe agus go n-éirí leo.

I am pleased to welcome from the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations Mr. Ken Norton, public relations officer; Mr. Paul O'Brien, president; and Mr. Peter Walsh, one of its beekeepers. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I advise them that their opening statements and any other document they have submitted to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	45	I thank the Chairman for allowing us to speak. During the 1960s and 1970s Ireland was known throughout the world as the land of milk and honey. We still produce milk today but not as much honey. During the years many of our uplands and hedgerows have disappeared and we now seldom see wildflower meadows. All of these changes have resulted in a reduction in the number of wild native bees at a time when we should be ensuring greater protection for vulnerable insects. Ireland prides itself on being a green island with wild tourism and green agriculture, but we should be more protective of nature. Wildlife, including bees, needs all of the help it can get. It is time for us all to sit down together to discuss concerns about managing uplands and hedgerows. We must come up with positive solutions to minimise the conflict with nature. I will speak from the heart. We have a major problem with the decline of habitats, flora and fauna, bees, birds and other wildlife. As citizens of Ireland and the world, we were given the land by way of a loan from our ancestors and must hand it over to the next generation in the condition in which we got it, without destroying it further. Ireland prides itself on its green image, yet habitats are disappearing. Elderly beekeepers all over the country have told me that in the past it was possible to keep 60 or 70 beehives, but it is no longer possible to do so because there is no food available. Hedgerows are protected, but there is no stipulation on how they are to be cut. In Ireland it has become habitual for them to be cut right down to the roots and then for mechanical diggers to be used to split the roots, which does not allow the hedgerows to grow back. Teagasc has been very supportive of the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations. Together, we produced a very good document last year on how to manage and cut hedgerows, but as there is no legislation in place, mechanical diggers are being used to remove them and they are not growing back. If we lose the insects, we will lose the birds and our green image. Canaries were brought down mines years ago and if they died, miners knew that they had to get out. Bees are now dying. They are telling us something, but if we do not listen to what it is, we will let down future generations.

We have a copy of the federation's How To guide in front of us. The points made by Mr. O'Brien are accepted in terms of biodiversity, the fact that we are custodians of the land and have a responsibility to hand it on in good condition to the next generation. Bees are a significant part of that biodiversity. Apart from what we can do as individuals in our gardens, in preserving meadows and not cutting grass and hedges, what can the committee do to assist the federation in its efforts to protect bees?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	I thank the Deputy for her question. There is an Act that deals with hedgerows and how they are to be cut and managed. We ask committee members to work to bring forward legislation to provide that hedgerows cannot be cut to within an inch of their lives. There should be guidelines and documentation, if not law, to ensure hedgerows cannot be cut right down to the roots, which means that they have no chance of growing again. We need criteria governing how they are to be cut. Cutting should not be allowed that does not meet the criteria as hedgerows are being destroyed. We also ask the committee to curtail the use of pesticides. They are being used by gardeners who might only have a couple of dandelions in their gardens. They are using what they think is the best chemical in the world, namely, Roundup or other neonicocides, but the damage they cause is unbelievable. We have a good working relationship with the farming community and ask them to notify beekeepers in their area when they are about to undertake spraying. We know and accept that they have to spray their crops, but if they tell us when they are about to do it, we can keep bees in on that day. We can close the door and not let them out. In that way, they will not come in contact with pesticides and die. However, under legislation there is no onus on the farming community to tell us.  These are little things, but they can make a big difference. We know that farmers and landowners have to make money. In the next round of CAP payments it could be stipulated that hedgerows must be protected according to certain criteria and that spraying is notifiable to beekeepers in an area. There are 63 beekeeper associations in the country and it would take only one e-mail to tell beekeepers in an area that Mr. Browne or Mrs. Browne is going to spray tomorrow morning. In that way, beekeepers in the locality could protect their bees. These are simple measures, but farmers will not do them on their own. They will need a gentle push or encouragement, whichever is the more effective.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	50	Yes, but they need an incentive. It could be a financial incentive or a carrot and stick approach could be used. We ask committee members, as legislators, to provide either a carrot or a stick. These are small measures that would be simple to execute. A pamphlet could be produced to explain that hedgerows cannot be cut below a certain limit or size and ask farmers to notify beekeepers when they are spraying. A small incentive is needed in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	51	We also need the all-Ireland pollinator plan to be adopted by as many local authorities as possible. Louth County Council adopted it recently and all of the roundabouts in the county have been converted into wildflower meadows. That is helping pollinators and an excellent idea. Tidy Towns committees should also be encouraged to become more involved in the all-Ireland pollinator plan. As the committee knows, 75% of what we consume must be pollinated, either by bees or another pollinator. If all pollinators were to die tomorrow, we would not necessarily die, but we would be left with only 25% of foodstuffs that do not need to be pollinated and our diet would be very limited.We would die rather more quickly because we would be left with a limited diet meaning we would get sick more often and so on. We need to protect the 75% we are talking about.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	53	The all-Ireland pollinator plan was drafted in 2015 and runs to 2020. It was drawn up with the National Biodiversity Data Centre. The Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations is one of the signatories to the plan, as are Bord Bia, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Heritage Council. Various other Government-funded organisations are involved. They attend various events, as we do, explaining hedgerows for pollinators, how to create and manage a wildflower meadow and how to create wild pollinator nesting habitats. They also try to get the farming community involved in planting more plants and flowers on farmland. The plan is intended to encourage everybody to get involved. The initiative has also been rolled out in schools and colleges. There are various versions, including a junior version, and a website, www.pollinators.ie. Most of the material is free. Users can download it and print it out or get a hard copy as they wish. Our main issue is to try to promote the pollinator plan more. When the plan first appeared it featured every day in newspapers, on television and so on. As with everything, however, funding ran out and only pops up now every now and again. The plan needs to be in the public's face so that people can see what to do, for example, they should not cut their grass every two minutes, as a lawn is not a football pitch, and they should let weeds grow as they benefit insects.

Are we at the bottom of the pile or in the middle when it comes to the preservation of our land and environment?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	63	Teagasc has worked tirelessly with the farming community and with us on the all-Ireland pollinator plan to produce a booklet on how to manage hedgerows correctly. The trouble is that, with the best will in the world, farmers are using the opportunity to cut the hedges right down. Hedgerows cannot recover from that. Farmers are concerned with profitability and using as much land as possible for pasture to get the dairy industry growing. They want to use every square inch of it. There must be an incentive to restore hedgerows, perhaps as part of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, or something like that. We had a discussion outside about a 1,000 acre farm in the countryside. If the farmer were to give back the linear acre, that is, the hedgerows, he would lose two, three or maybe ten acres out of his 1,000. The farmer could not do it. He said it was not profitable enough for him to do that. This is what we are up against. Very few county councils have taken the pollination plan on board and have-----

The county councils are concerned with their locale. Members of the Oireachtas deal with many issues, including legislation. Are county councils ignoring beekeepers or are they just being lazy?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	67	They are being lazy. They have all received this information and heard presentations about the pollination plan. I do not disregard the fact that Oireachtas Members are the public face. People hear and see them quite often. They are legislators. They can provide encouragement and pass down the message. We have tried to work from the bottom up. To get people involved we need the top-down approach as well.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	73	It is very simple. In any local supermarket every single fruit and vegetable with a colour is pollinated by a pollinator. Bees are dedicated. Imagine a field of oilseed rape. Bees will come out of their hive, spot the oilseed rape and identify a lovely source of food. Every single bee will repeatedly go back to those flowers until their nectar has been fully exhausted. They are dedicated pollinators. A bumblebee will come along and say hello to a flower before going to the next field. Honey bees go back to the same food source until it is exhausted. That is why they are the primary pollinators. Let us return to the supermarket. If there are no bees, all the coloured fruit and vegetables will be gone.

Who are the people on the street who have been so passionate about this during the last year? It is the children. They do not want us to hand them an environment that has been destroyed. Every one of us is in charge. Anybody over the age of 30 is responsible for what happened in the past. We cannot go back and change the industrial revolution. We have to look after what we have today. The Senator is of the same vintage as I am. Many years ago when driving across the country one would find the windscreen was covered in insects. Today one can drive from here to Galway and one might see two insects.

They drive across Ireland and think Ireland is magnificent, green, emerald and all of that. They do not lock into the reality of what Mr. O'Brien is saying.

It would be useful for the committee to get a list of the county councils that have signed up to all-Ireland pollinator plan. If such a list is not already on the website of the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations, it might be useful to highlight that on it.

For instance, allotments were opened only recently in my area of Bluebell. I got my keys last week but I have not done anything yet. Allotments encourage people to grow crops. However, if they are located in the middle of a built-up area where flies, wasps, bees and so on are being killed off with pesticides, with all the will in the world there will not be an abundance of crops. One idea that came up in discussions with some of the other allotment holders was to try to get the council to encourage the growth of colourful flowers in the hedging or near the fencing around thee allotments to attract bees.

In the main, people understand this issue, even if they are not fully aware of the full consequences. The beekeepers have supporters, certainly among members of this committee who have expressed an interest. We will have witnesses from BirdWatch Ireland before the committee in a number of weeks. There is an understanding on this committee and, I believe, among the population in general that we have reached crisis point and need to take action. It is not just about Bord na Móna. It is also the national parks, the Phoenix Park and all of those areas. The witness mentioned meadows, allowing areas to grow wild and so on.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	121	Mr. Walsh would like to say a few words because he has been a beekeeper for longer than any of us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	122	I am from the South Kilkenny Beekeepers Association. I started beekeeping in 1959, which is a good while ago. The Chairman asked how bad the situation has become. From that time until 2000, beekeeping was fairly steady. I had 24 stocks of bees in my apiary until 2000 and I was doing okay by them. There was plenty of food and foraging in the area. I can now only keep six stocks. That goes to show what has happened. From keeping 24 stocks, the number has gone down steadily. It is alright for me, as a beekeeper, to say this area can only cater for six stocks when it was 24 in the past. I could put the balance in my car and I might get an apiary from the Chairman or the gentleman beside him and I would spread them out. However, the bumblebee or the solitary bee cannot get into a motor car and drive 20 miles down the road where the area is good. They will be gone. I am passionate about this issue. When I was in school in 1957, 1958 and 1959, I was taught by Mr. Doran. He was the man who founded Macra na Tuaithe, which was the forerunner to the farmers club. He gave me a project to do on bees. People with farmer's land might be asked to rear a calf and start them off. I had no land so he gave me a job counting bumblebees, which I did. I have been counting bumblebees since. Where I was getting bees on a certain hedgerow at a particular time - I have photographs - I can see that bumblebee numbers have gone down by about 70%. We are facing a serious problem. I will tell the committee how valuable bees are and respond to Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's questions on their value. In the spring of 2016, which is only three years ago, I had a phone call from a gentleman in Kilkenny by the name of Hughes who asked me if I could help him. I asked him in what way I should help and he asked me to send him some bees. I told him we had lost up to 70% of our bees because of lack of pollen at the back end of 2015, which was very cold, and the start of 2016. I asked him what his problem was. He was a farmer who had sewn 20 acres of pumpkins and he said a man had asked if he had the bees to pollinate them. He did not know pumpkins had to be pollinated. I told him I would get him a few hives of bees but that I could not get him many.I rang him at Christmas when the season was over and asked how he got on. He said that he got on well but he had 100 acres for next year and needed some bees. He said that he had to import bumble bees from Northern Ireland and that the bumble bee was ten times better than the ordinary bee that we had for that particular job. I said that did not surprise me because the bumble bee will pollinate at a lower temperature than our bees, at around 10°C, while our bees have to have a temperature of 15°C or 16°C before they can do any pollinating. Bumble bees are crucial. Mr. Doran told me, God be good to him, in 1959, that if anything happened to the bumble bee, we would be in trouble. The Chairman asked about Kilkenny. I went into Kilkenny County Council two years ago. I was the head of the posse. I asked the council about this pollinator plan. I asked it to do something to highlight the situation and it adopted the black and amber bumble bee as the insect for Kilkenny. I stated last year that it is all right for it to adopt the bumble bee but I want to see what the council is doing. It said it was going to put a plan in place. I waited until the local elections were over and went to a councillor to ask what the council had done about various verges along motorways and such. There is much work that could be done there. If something is not done quickly, we will lose the whole lot. We have the power to destroy and eliminate but we do not have the power to get them back. I got a bit frustrated one day when I went to Kilkenny County Council. I said to myself that I was like a drop in the ocean but that if all the drops make up the ocean, everybody could do a little, such as a person with a hanging basket or people who leave a little bit of their garden to go wild, bringing their children out to look at the bees and the butterflies. Without bees, we would have no birds or anything else. I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak here and I hope I answered the question of how valuable those pollinators are to humans. I am heartened. I am afraid that people who are 40 or 50 are not taking it seriously, but people younger than that, including those in schools, are taking it very seriously. Certain schoolmasters come along and ask me to give various talks. I thank the committee for the opportunity.

If our guests think that we can take any practical steps of that nature, I am willing to put the matter to the members over the next while. If they come across a stumbling block and think that our intervention would be useful, they should just ask for help. I think that is not as much as we can do but it is the least that we can do.

I was tied up with something else. My understanding, from looking at the documentation provided and from what was said to me when it became known that our guests would be coming in, is that in parts of the country, the cutting of hedgerows is a major issue. In large swathes of the west, especially where I live, there is very little hedgerow cutting and any such cutting is quite cursory in nature. It is done along the roads by the county council, on just the outside hedges, not the inside hedges, in an attempt to make them more vertical than lateral. Even in the time that I have been in Corr na Móna, there are many more hedges, including many higher ones, in the west than was the case previously. These are deciduous, whitethorn or traditional hedges. This year was a great year for whitethorn. If one drives along the roads, they are ablaze with whitethorn. There is more gorse than there ever was. In fact, more land is used than there was 40, 50 or 60 years ago. Are there areas of the country where the hedgerows and the bees are thriving? I remember it being pointed out to me many years ago that there was a substantial change in farming balance and patterns from a multicultural approach, with the sowing of oats, potatoes, vegetables, some fruit and so on being popular, to just producing more and more grass because that is what farmers were getting paid to do. Has that had a negative effect on what our guests were describing? The hedges are not cut across large swathes of the country and there is much more cover than previously, with many more wild flowers not being cut. Is the bee population in those areas thriving? In areas where there is wholesale mechanical cutting by the farmers with sophisticated machines that can cut every side of the hedge - up, down and across - is there a difference in the number of bees? How much is the change in farm practice having an effect?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	132	I thank the Deputy. He was out of the room earlier. In the dairy belt from Athlone to Cork, the hedgerows are cut down to within an inch of their lives, to the stalk and root. The diggers break the stalk as they are doing that and the hedgerows are not recovering. I live in the same town as the Deputy in Galway. The hedgerows and fields are good in Galway but the wind coming in off the sea keeps the bees busy trying to fly in straight lines. I am talking about the dairy belt from Athlone to Cork.

Places such as where I live are inland. They are not right by the sea. Has the bee population-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	134	It has to a degree. In our own association in Galway, we had 14 members when we set it up five years ago. We now have 100 members. Some 100 new beekeepers have come into our area. Technically, the bee population in the west has increased but that is down to the work we are doing.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	135	Can Mr. O'Brien prove, by comparing one with the other, the direct relationship between the hedge cutting that is going on and the population of bees?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	136	Yes. In our area, we use the number of supers to determine how much honey will come into a beehive.In the west, we are still getting two or three supers per hive when we get the right summer weather as we had last year. Mr. Walsh, for example, is down the other end of the country and he might have had five or six supers per beehive years ago but he is barely getting two now.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	137	Second, has the drift towards monoculture been a factor?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	138	Yes, vast tracts of grassland have been heavily fertilised with nitrogen and manure. It is just pure grass; there is nothing else there. The Deputy should put himself in a bee's shoes. A bee can only fly three miles to get food and if it is flying over grass, which has no food, it suddenly starves.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	139	I want to raise an interesting side note which has nothing to do with bees. I was to Inishbofin last weekend. There has been a significant revival in the corncrake population on the islands off the west coast. Part of what caused their demise was the lack of farming when the islands became depopulated, as well as changes in farming practices. Strangely, in some cases it was just pure depopulation. However, there has been a significant revival. I was listening to Raidió na Gaeltachta and corncrakes appeared in Baile an Fheirtéaraigh recently. The corncrake is making a comeback and, therefore, that shows that if the circumstances are changed, the game is not over. One of my suggestions is that we should write to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and copy the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I have waited for years for a special measure under GLAS, which used to be the rural environment protection scheme, REPS. This is up for negotiation because a new plan will come in after 2020. Instead of it being the case that the best money to be earned from environmentally friendly farming is to put land in grass and do nothing apart from keeping the grass cut, €1,000 or €2,000 should be paid to people to have kitchen gardens, or to recreate more traditional diverse farming. With small mechanical devices, much of the hard labour can be taken out of having a half acre of potatoes, vegetables or whatever. Would that be a help? Environmental schemes such as GLAS have good features in them but they tend to lead to monoculture because it is easier to get money from a scheme if the measures are simple. I wanted a measure that would be like the trailing shoe measure where fertiliser was injected to reduce fertiliser use so that there would be a specific measure for diversity in crops. For example, certain areas set aside in the tillage sector. What were they called?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	140	They were set aside for bumblebees in areas they had settled.

In other areas we need a little bit of tillage or planting of various types. Would the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations be supportive if we suggested that the new environmental programme be much more diverse?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	142	We would be very supportive of that. We would also be very supportive of not losing what we have. I reiterate that the hedgerows have to be cut and managed but they should not be removed. We have photographic evidence of fields that were there three years ago-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	144	No, the west is perfect. I am going to give out about the other end of the country because it is gone. All we want is for that to be saved and protected and the only way to do that is to bring out some rules for how to cut them and not to remove them. They are being removed by stealth but I agree with the Deputy that we need to open of the countryside to methods other than monocultures.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	147	I will not hold up the meeting too long. I was held up with other matters and I happened to follow part of the debate from my office. It is fantastic that we are discussing such important issues within the confines of these Houses. I have one or two short questions, which have probably been touched on so I will be happy with a short answer. I have a background in horticulture so I know a little about how important this debate about bees is. It is disturbing that so many people still laugh when one talks about the importance of the bee for human beings. This is a significant problem. We often see environmental advertisements about different matters. What about an awareness campaign on television, radio and social media about getting serious about the importance of the bee, particularly the bumblebee? Mr. Walsh referred to the black and amber. I live in Strokestown and we have black and amber there as well. Young people are great, the schools are fantastic and the teachers are good in the schools but there is a problem with large parts of society who laugh at this and think it is airy-fairy stuff that we are discussing. I am talking about awareness. How does the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations think we could improve it? If we could we get the relevant Department to fund an awareness campaign, would that be a good idea?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-06-12 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	148	It would. I will answer this in two ways to give a bit of positivity. When I started in beekeeping, I was invited to a school once every two years if I was lucky. I would go in and they would look and they would be horrified when they saw bees. I always go to the eight year old classes, I do six schools in my district, and, in recent years, when I go in, the kids are not terrified of bees. They know more about bees than I ever did at their age, they are hugely positive and they contact me when they see a bumblebee or something in difficulty. The positivity is there with all the youth. They have it and they understand it. We see them on the streets protesting about the earth and the climate. They are ahead of the game and we are only catching up as elderly adults. We missed the game here a few years back but the children are positive. This is the first time we have been asked to any Oireachtas committee to speak about the bees so I thank the committee for that. This is the first opportunity we have ever had. I represent 3,500 members. It is a voluntary organisation and we get a pittance of €8,000 each year to keep it running. We conduct two surveys every year for the Government and that is where most of our money goes. We do not have any bee health inspectors and we do not have any bee support inspectors. In England, there are bee supports and instead of going to see the vet, one goes to see the bee support inspector to address a problem. We get free testing from Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Department pays for health inspections on our bees. We send samples, which we used to pay for but for the last two years it has been free so that is a slightly positive move. However, a lot of money is coming into the country for research and everything else but we do not get it on the ground. There are 3,200 beekeepers, each one with up to three or four hives. Each hive has about 60,000 bees so we are doing our bit. On support for beekeepers, this has been the first opportunity to talk to Government representatives at an equal level and we thank the committee for that. We would like more media attention but we are volunteers. We try our best and, to be fair to Mr. Norton, he is running around ragged. I used to do his job and the members have all met the late Phillip McCabe. God rest his soul he is gone. He was an Irishman who was president of Apimondia. We have done our best but we our hands are tied because we are a voluntary organisation and we are trying to get there.

We can hear the passion. If the committee members did not understand previously, we understand now how important it is. Hopefully today's session gets the publicity it deserves. The witnesses have laid it out quite well and, hopefully, we will be able to impact on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the councils. I presume that the next pollination plan is in hand and we will try to encourage whatever help can be given to the federation. Hopefully, the federation will be able to come back to us in a few years and tell us that it has managed to address the decline at the very least and perhaps encouraged an increase but it will take quite a number of years. The federation has gone great work.
