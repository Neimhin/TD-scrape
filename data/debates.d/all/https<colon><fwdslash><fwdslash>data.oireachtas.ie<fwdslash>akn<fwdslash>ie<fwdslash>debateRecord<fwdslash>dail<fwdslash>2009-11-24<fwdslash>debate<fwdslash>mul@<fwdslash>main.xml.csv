#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.Of the 169 civil servants currently serving in my Department, 28 have applied through the central applications facility, CAF, to relocate under the decentralisation programme.The breakdown by grade is nine assistant principals, five higher executive officers, two administrative officers, four executive officers, one staff officer, six clerical officers and one from the services grades.A total of 29 former members of staff have already been assigned to decentralised posts.  There are no proposals to decentralise my Department or any of the bodies under its aegis.  It is a matter for those Departments to which staff from my Department have decentralised to assign such staff to locations outside Dublin.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Were one to ask the people, they might have a view on decentralising the Taoiseach's Department.  I refer to the 28 persons who have applied to the CAF for decentralisation from the Department of the Taoiseach.  For what Departments and locations have they stated a preference?  Have a number of the locations for which they have expressed a preference been stalled because of the general position in respect of decentralisation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I do not have to hand information on what are their preferences.  It is a matter for decentralised offices to use the central applications facility to decide what personnel will be asked to move to the locations.  This will be in line with their preferences.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Arising from this, the Government provided €72 million in an envelope for decentralisation in 2009.  What proportion of money has been spent on decentralisation?  The Government also made a decision that, arising from the general economic situation, no further expenditure will take place on the acquisition of accommodation for decentralisation unless it was vetted by the decentralisation implementation group.  What has happened in respect of the decision?  Is information available from the decentralisation implementation group?  There are 35 locations where a review is pending in 2011.  What will happen to the sites in those cases?  Many were acquired at exorbitant prices.  They have devalued as a consequence of the general situation.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has information on that.Does the Taoiseach have information on the cost of maintaining empty buildings?  The State owns quite a number of buildings in the decentralisation process that are lying empty.  Given that we are a fortnight from the budget and given the projections for next year, is the decentralisation process still alive or is this just another sham, saying a review will take place in 2011 when the world and its mother knows that in many of these locations nothing will happen in respect of the announcements made many years ago by the then Minister, Charlie McCreevy?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Detailed questions in respect of the decentralisation programme are dealt with by the Department of Finance.  I am dealing with my Department's position.  From replies issued by the Department of Finance at the time and since then by the new incumbent, there has been a saving by Departments and the State in respect of the cost of relocating to sites as opposed to the disposal of sites in Dublin at very high prices.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The Taoiseach said the number of people who had applied for decentralisation from his Department was 28.  That is exactly the number who had applied for decentralisation in March.  I take it from his reply that nobody has been decentralised from his Department since March.  When was the last occasion on which there was a successful applicant for decentralisation?  In other words, when was someone last decentralised from the Department of the Taoiseach?What is the position regarding the announcement in the October 2008 budget that, in effect, the decentralisation process has been put on hold?  Does that mean no further applications are being accepted or considered within Departments or does it mean no further decentralisation is taking place?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I assume there has been no further decentralisation since this question was asked in March.  The detail of the programme is dealt with by the Department of Finance.  The decision made in the last budget stands.  Those who are in the process of moving will continue to complete the move while others are kept under review until 2011.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	7	If someone had been accepted for decentralisation in March or last October and the person had started the process of moving, is this move to be completed?  Since that announcement in October, are no applications now being entertained for decentralisation?  Is that the current position?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The detail of where the programme is in every respect is best dealt with by the Department of Finance.  That Department deals with the decentralisation programme on an ongoing basis.  Advance parties in temporary offices that will be converted into permanent premises in the location they are in or locations in the same town will complete decentralisation in that way.  In 2011, the Government will review decisions in respect of those agencies or Departments that had not progressed issues to the point where sites were allocated or buildings were being built.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Is decentralisation still a cornerstone of Government policy on delivering public services?  A report in one of the newspapers at the weekend suggested the Government is considering reducing the number of local authorities to 22.  The Taoiseach will recall that his party lost the local elections.  I presume he will not do a Robert Mugabe on local government.  How does he reconcile reducing the number of local authorities with a policy that has decentralisation as its approach to delivering local public services?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	10	That relates to a review on programme expenditure, the McCarthy report.  Recommendations have been made in respect of trying to rationalise local authorities and local authority provision.  One reads much in the newspapers coming up to budget time, including speculation, argument and suggestions.  Decisions are made on budget day and we should concentrate on these.  How I reconcile any change that must take place, whether in local authority structures, the health services or any area of provision of public services, is that we need to modernise and use every possible means of rationalising services to best effect to have the most cost-effective system.  The county system has served us over the years, with various educational committees such as town VECs, county VECs, regional bodies and a series of organisations.  Some of these were built for programmes at the insistence of the European Union.  All of this is being considered, some in the short term and some in the medium term.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Can the Taoiseach indicate if the following rumour is correct, namely, that the policy of decentralisation will be abandoned at the budget and replaced by a policy of centralisation in the interest of economies of scale?  The Taoiseach is essentially doing a U-turn on the policy he implemented during his term as Minister for Finance.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the McCarthy report critique of his decentralisation programme and the waste of public money and lack of efficiency that resulted from it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Neither assertion is true.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Deputy Shatter is not from the decentralisation wing of Fine Gael.  There are a few wings in the party on this issue.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Taoiseach is running out of people to impress.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	26	There have been two reports from the public service benchmarking body.  The increases recommended in the first report of the body were implemented in my Department in the following manner: the first 25% of the recommended increase was paid in June 2003 with effect from 1 December 2001.  The total cost to December 2003 was approximately €405,000.  A further 50% of the recommended increase was paid from 1 January 2004 at an approximate cost of €491,000 for that year.  The final 25% of the recommended increase was paid from 1 June 2005 at an approximate cost of €150,000 for that year.  The annual cost of full implementation is approximately €900,000.The second report of the public service benchmarking body recommended an increase of 1.1% for the grade of principal officer.  No other increase was recommended in respect of general Civil Service grades.  No payment has been made to date by my Department in respect of this recommendation, the estimated annual cost of which to my Department would be €26,000.Pay increases recommended by the public service benchmarking body are conditional on delivery of real and verifiable outputs regarding modernisation and flexibility.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	27	In the talks that will begin tomorrow with the social partners and trade union leaders does the Government intend to put on the table a plan for a more efficient public service?  As everyone understands the system has strangled initiative in many ways and as the Taoiseach will meet union leaders tomorrow, does the Government have a plan to introduce or bring about a more effective and efficient public service?  Is the question of a reverse benchmarking process being discussed by the Government and with the trade unions?  A reverse benchmarking process could apply in achieving marked efficiencies.  Is this issue being discussed by the Government and with the trade unions?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Talks are ongoing; they are not beginning tomorrow.  As the Deputy is aware, they are on the basis of the trade unions' indication that they believe policy options are available to the Government for the purposes of achieving necessary savings next year in the public service pay bill.  Obviously, the Government has been in discussions with the trade unions on various data and policy issues that arise and these discussions will continue tomorrow.  In the context of the ongoing discussions and against the background of the agenda to transform public services being the means by which the Government can look to progress in transforming public services and providing a template for public service reform, the Government has indicated, at the unions' request and through documentation, its vision for the public service in the medium and longer term.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I will illustrate my next question with an anecdote.  I was contacted recently by an employer who had applied to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for optical benefit for one of his employees.  The employer was obliged to fill in an A4 page containing a series of questions that took approximately eight minutes to answer.  It then was necessary to post the A4 page to the Department where it was sent to the relevant section.  It took a number of days before it reached the relevant person who reprocessed the questions on the A4 page and input the data into the system in order that the application for optical benefit would be considered.  My point is that all of this information was contained on the P35 form submitted previously by the employer.  Six years ago I noted that were the benchmarking awards to be paid at the then cost of €1 billion, the Government should have seen to it that efficiencies were achieved as a consequence.  This story is typical of hundreds of thousands of cases in a system that is inefficient, costs money, incurs delays and not in the best interests of either the employee or the customer.  With hindsight, does the Taoiseach believe it was a good idea to pay the benchmarking money without securing benchmarks for efficiency in a public service that is so critical to so many aspects of Irish life?  Was it a good idea to pay it without requiring any efficiencies for extra benefit for the customer?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Pay increases recommended under that process were conditional on real and verifiable outputs with regard to modernisation and flexibility.  There were conditions attached to the payment.  In some cases where there was a delay in agreed modernisation or flexibility was not forthcoming, the payments were also delayed until such time as that was delivered.  It is not right to say there was no conditionality attached to the process.  What is clear, however, is that there is a need and an opportunity to accelerate change in how we deliver our public services for the benefit of citizens who require them, based on both the financial realities we must now contend with and in the interests of enabling and empowering those who are involved in the work of providing public services being able to do so as cost effectively and efficiently as possible, incorporating best practice in every respect and consistent with the principles of public accountability.  That is an ongoing process that will have to be accelerated.  Taking on the challenge of that change is not easy or simple but it must be pursued, and it is better to proceed with it on the basis of agreement that everybody has the shared objective of providing public services in this country by giving the best possible value to the taxpayer.The Deputy mentioned an anecdote related to him recently.  The question of being able to share information and providing the necessary technology for transferring information across the system in a consistent way, which is also consistent with data protection issues, is on the agenda.  Some progress has been made, although it is greater in some Departments than in others.  Good examples in that respect are the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  There has been a transformation in those Departments and offices in recent years in terms of the ability to provide very substantive payments on an ongoing basis, on time and directly to the people entitled to the payments.  The need to provide that best practice model across the system and to share the information in a way that would lessen the amount of time required for information to be collated and dealt with by individual Departments or service providers is something we must examine.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I was referring to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  My apologies for my mistake.  Is the Taoiseach confident that in the discussions he is recommencing tomorrow with the trades union leaders he can arrive at a position where further industrial action will be averted?  Does he, on behalf of the Government, have a plan that can convince the trades unions and the social partnership that it is possible to bring about a leaner, more efficient public service?  Is he happy he will be able to convince them that what he proposes is actually workable and will achieve a more efficient and reliable public service in the interests of all the people?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	32	It is a challenging agenda for all sides, both management and staff.  I believe the discussions have been entered into in good faith.  There is an understanding and recognition of the Government's position in terms of the financial realities with which we must deal.  Obviously, there is limited time available to see whether the basis of an agreement is possible.  The Government has decisions to take, by 9 December next at the latest.  The discussions we are having are at the suggestion of the trades unions and are examining policy options that would provide the savings while at the same time providing us with a means to proceed with a process of reform that will meet the existing commitments that all parties entered into agreement about in the Towards 2016 document.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Is it the Government's intention to reach agreement with the public service trade unions on issues relating to pay, reorganisation and reform in the public service prior to the budget?  I heard on the lunchtime radio news that the public service unions had committed themselves to a second day of industrial action on 3 December.  Is it the Government's intention to try to conclude an agreement with the unions prior to that date?  If, as the Taoiseach acknowledges, the public service is in need of the reorganisation and reform that require major decisions to be made, what has the Government been doing for the last 12 years that these reforms have not been achieved before now?  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the report of the review body on higher remuneration has been received by the Government?  Has it been considered by the Government and what decision has been made on it?  What is recommended in the report in respect of remuneration?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	34	On the third point, that issue has not yet been considered by the Government.  It is being examined in the Department of Finance and has not yet been brought before the Government.On the first issue raised by the Deputy, the objective of the Government is to proceed, if possible, on the basis of an agreement that meets the economic and financial objectives we have set.  In respect of what has been happening in the last 12 years, many initiatives have been taken on the modernisation of various parts of the public service.  Some have met with far more success than others.  Those where there has been success are a very good indicator of what is possible when there is good, motivated management with good staff representation that can recognise where the organisation needs to go, that the most important people are the citizens whom we serve and that the service should be responsive and flexible enough to meet the needs of citizens, which can vary from time to time throughout a citizen's life depending on what public service is involved.  The need for flexibility, to move beyond organisational boundaries and achieve a joint working approach in a team effort, regardless of where people are employed, to maximise the service, given that we have limited resources, is absolutely critical.  Where this has happened, many such services have moved from crisis management mode to a totally different situation, where there is far more satisfaction, both for the organisation in terms of how it is perceived by the public and for those who work in it.Change should be seen as a positive prospect.  To see it as something negative to be postponed or not proceeded with in a joint effort is an approach that does not meet the requirements of our current situation or at any time.  Change is a constant for many organisations.  It is certainly the situation in the private sector and must be so for the public sector.  For those of us interested in seeing the public sector continue to play its role, it is about a public sector which is responsive, flexible and understands the need for the changes that must take place.  These changes are outlined in the transforming public services programme.  It is a very good context and background against which much good work can be done if people put their minds to it.  The context for this to happen will be based on the discussions we are having.I have always made the point that it is better to proceed by agreement.  However, at the same time, the Government has its responsibilities to discharge and it will do so.  The question of what dates are set for strikes will not dictate the Government's position.  The objective merits of the situation require that we proceed and to do so on an agreed basis is preferable once we meet the objectives we are talking about.  Everyone recognises that the financial situation of the country is such that those objectives have to be met.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Taoiseach said that a number of agencies and offices in the public sector have achieved reforms, reorganisation and efficiencies.  Will that be factored into future measures that might be taken generally in the public service?I refer to the benchmarking exercise.  He will recall that the greatest dissatisfaction about the benchmarking process related to the secrecy that surrounded it.  The idea was that posts in the public service would be benchmarked against similar posts outside the public service, yet nobody could ever say what exactly was benchmarked against what, what external comparators were used, what levels of salary, remuneration and so on applied and what was the basis for the benchmarking.  If there is a reverse benchmarking exercise, as suggested by Deputy Kenny, can the Taoiseach assure the House that the next time round the full information will be made public in order that the comparisons made will be fully known?  People would then be able to outline that a particular post was measured against a particular range of posts elsewhere, the salaries and remuneration packages that apply to these posts and why these comparisons are being made.  The last time round all that was made publicly available was the outcome, which was increases in pay, but the rationale and the comparisons done were never made known to anybody.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	36	That was the criticism that attended the first benchmarking process where we were initiating a process and seeking to provide confidence in the system, but the second benchmarking process was more transparent regarding its terms of reference and information on comparators.  The report confirms that; it was a learning exercise in that respect.  The purpose was always that the public service would not lead wage trends in the private sector but, instead, follow them.  The ongoing discussions with the unions in respect of this is on the basis of the new economic and financial realities we are facing.  I have acknowledged the fact that during the year the Government had to take decisions involving a pension levy of approximately 6.9% from the overall pay of public servants towards public service pensions provision in the future.  That has been acknowledged but in 2010 a particular will arise, which must be dealt with.  We are in bona fide discussions with staff representatives on that issue.The Deputy mentioned the strike.  I am disappointed there is any strike.  While one is in discussions with people, it is far better to conduct the discussions and it will not be any different in respect of what the issues are tomorrow no more than it was yesterday or today or any other day.  It is necessary to focus on the specifics of the issue in front of us to see if it is possible to find a basis of any agreement that addresses both the short-term issue and also provides a means by which an accelerated change programme would be the feature of the coming years in order that we can implement the transforming public services agenda, which provides a good and detailed context in which such discussions could take place.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.These are political agreements that my predecessor entered into as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party with individual Independent Deputies.  On becoming leader of Fianna Fáil, I confirmed to the Deputies concerned that I would continue to implement these agreements.  The House is aware that such arrangements have been in place for more than 12 years.  The agreements are confidential but they are, as always, based on the programme for Government which incorporates the national development plan, approved Government programmes and annual Estimates for capital and current expenditure.  I have continued the practice whereby a staff member in my office assists the Government Chief Whip's office in its work in liaising with the Deputies concerned.  This official meets the Deputies on a regular basis and arranges to keep them briefed on issues as they arise.  The official dealing with them is an assistant principal officer and assists the Chief Whip in this matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	38	This is the sort of nonsense that goes on here.  We are all into accountability and transparency and holding the Government to account, yet we are asked to believe in 2009 the sovereign Government of Ireland has a secret deal with a number of Independent Deputies.  I would like the Taoiseach to clear this up once and for all.  Is there an unpublished deal between the Government and Deputies Lowry and Healy-Rae about which nobody else knows except members of an elite corps of the Government and the Deputies involved?  When Deputy Flynn was on the Independent benches, the story was another deal had been done between the Taoiseach's predecessor and the good Deputy.  This issue was raised with me recently.  Is there a deal between the Government and Deputy Flynn?  I would like a "Yes" or "No" answer to that question.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I do not know what the dynamics of politics in County Mayo are but every member of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party supports the Government in office unconditionally and without question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Therefore, none of them is more equal than others.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	42	What about the other two Deputies?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	43	That is a political agreement.  The Deputy will have found that when one is trying to secure a majority on a county council or coming into a new Dáil and one has not had a chance to form a Government, political agreements are reached.  These agreements are based on the programme for Government, on which basis the support of the Deputies is available to the Government.  That has been the arrangement all of the time.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The Taoiseach has said the agreements with the Independent Deputies are based on the programme for Government which was revised recently.  Were they revised in line with the revision of the programme for Government?  To which Deputies do the agreements now apply?  Did members of the McCarthy group have access to the agreements?  Did they give consideration to their contents in their review of expenditure in the public sector?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	45	No, they were not asked to second guess political agreements between parties.  That would be an unusual precedent to set, as the Deputy will be aware.  The agreements, which continue, were put in place on the formation of the Government in 2007.  Deputies Lowry and Healy-Rae have those understandings which we will seek to honour in mutually supportive fashion.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The Taoiseach said the agreements were entered into in 2007.  My recollection is that the agreements entered into in 2007 concerned four Deputies.  These were Deputies Jackie Healy-Rae, Michael Lowry, Finian McGrath and Beverly Flynn.  With which Deputies is there a current agreement?  Do the agreements cover any matter of public expenditure?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I have just outlined that Deputies Lowry and Healy-Rae, who support the Government, have an agreement with it.  There was an agreement with Deputy Finian McGrath relevant to his support of the Government.  He withdrew support for the Government and therefore no arrangements arise.  The matter depends on support for the Government and this is usually the way it works.  The day a Deputy withdraws support for a government, he or she will find there will be no support from it.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I do not get into the details of these agreements but that issue post-dates any agreement made at the time.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	51	The matter should be addressed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The Taoiseach did not reply to one part of my earlier question.  I asked him if the agreements covered any aspect of public expenditure and I do not recall him replying to it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Any political agreements are subject to understandings about various policy matters which the Government is prepared to proceed with and which have the support and agreement of any Deputy supporting the Government.  This is about people representing their areas in respect of Government policy.  At the time the Government was formed, it was possible to enter into political agreements with those Deputies consistent with the Government's objectives.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.On 22 April 2009, the Government appointed Deputy Pat Carey as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Defence; and Deputy Dick Roche as Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European affairs.As Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is primarily responsible for the organisation of Government business in the Dáil and for the Government's programme for Dáil reform.  He also oversees the preparation of the Government's legislative programme.  I have also assigned responsibility for the active citizenship initiative in my Department to the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  The role of the Minister of State will be to drive the initiative forward, oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on active citizenship and, critically, promote the concept of active citizenship in all spheres of Irish life.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, will be supported in this work by a steering group chaired by Ms Mary Davis.  In addition, my statutory functions relating to the Central Statistics Office have been delegated to the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.In my Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, chairs an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European Union affairs.  The committee keeps under review and works to ensure coherence on the full range of issues on the EU's agenda.  The committee has a particular focus on the correct and timely transposition of EU legislation.In addition to these duties, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, represents the Government at a wide range of EU and international meetings.  He plays a central role in consolidating and further developing Ireland's bilateral relations with EU member states.  He also plays a key role in communicating the importance of the European Union to Ireland and thus fostering enhanced public understanding of EU issues.As always, questions on the functions of particular Ministers of State in other Departments should be tabled to the relevant Ministers.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	55	Is it intended to change the Ministers and Secretaries (Ministers of State) Act 2007 to reduce the numbers of Ministers of State?  The Taoiseach is aware that Deputy Shatter published a Private Members' Bill allowing for a reduction of numbers to 12.  The Government has reduced the number to 15 but this does not restrict it in increasing it again to what it was.  Is the current number permanent or is it intended to go below it?  Will there be legal effect through changing the Ministers and Secretaries (Ministers of State) Act 2007?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I have no immediate plans in that regard.  Political decisions were taken during the course of the year as part of our response to the emerging financial position.  I regard the work done by Ministers of State as important; it is not only supplementary to the work of Ministers, as they carry out work which is important for the Government and the general public in their delegated duties.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Concern has been expressed in the House on a number of occasions about the practice which has developed, whereby a rota for Ministers of State seems to be in operation for the Adjournment Debate.  One Minister of State may come into the House to read a script for three or four Departments, depending on the questions asked.  At a minimum, I ask that a Minister or Minister of State from the relevant Department deliver the reply to an Adjournment Debate.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The objective should be, where possible, to have a Minister or Minister of State from the relevant Department but that is not always possible.  It is a question of Dáil reform as to when these matters might be taken during the course of the parliamentary day.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The general function of regional authorities is to review the overall needs and development requirements of their respective regions and facilitate communication and co-operation between local authorities and other public authorities with regard to policies and services being delivered by these bodies.  The role of regional authorities under the Planning and Development Act 2000 in drawing up regional planning guidelines as an overall co-ordinating framework for all city and county development plans is of particular importance in pursuing sustainable development.The Green Paper on local government, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, which I published in April 2008, raised the question as to whether change in local government arrangements was necessary in key locations to drive regional development.  Stronger Local Democracy noted that part of the challenge was to ensure local government would be capable of developing and facilitating the development of the gateways as envisaged by the national spatial strategy.  The renewed programme for Government is relevant to this question, as it commits to the provision of democratic leadership for regional authorities and the strengthening of their strategic role across a range of functions, in addition to their realignment to reflect the gateways in the national spatial strategy.  The White Paper on local government which I will bring to the Government shortly will reflect the programme's commitments.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The Minister mentioned the programme for Government and the Green Paper which, in chapter 2, mentions that, because of the small size of Ireland, there is centralised administration, with people having an affinity for local structures.  The Green Paper did not advocate strong elected regional authorities.  Is that still the Government's position?  In the light of the fact that the Green Paper was strongly supportive of local government structures, is it still Government policy to have county, city and town councils, taking into account the recent comments made by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I will answer the last question first.  It is our intention to have them.  I have always been of the view that we need to have local government at all effective levels.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, is overruled.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Again.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, has a view on all these matters.  He has been in this role in the past but I am telling the Deputy what the situation is.  In other jurisdictions, particularly on the Continent and in the United States, there is representation at local level, in even the smallest towns.  That system operates very effectively but in Germany and elsewhere there is very effective regional government.  That is a tier of government that needs to be enhanced in this country to deliver consistency across all local authorities.  The Deputy and I have discussed this issue and he knows my thinking on planning matters.  He will be aware of issues around zonings and regional planning guidelines in Carlow in his constituency and that various local authorities have different approaches.  We have to have consistency.The Green Paper presents three options and notes that different solutions can apply in different areas.  It envisages a metropolitan cross-boundary mayor with a strategic role in delivering with a city-region focus, joint leadership of local authorities through the joint election of a single mayor to chair and represent local authorities and the creation of unitary authorities.  The Deputy will also be aware——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I want to allow another supplementary question before the time expires.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	66	——that we are moving ahead with the Dublin mayoralty, with elections planned in the summer of 2010.  We have to look at the system in London where there is also an assembly to which the mayor is answerable.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Minister got carried away in trying to explain the comments of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey.  I am glad he has overruled them and that he is a very strong supporter of local government, unlike the Minister for Transport who often speaks without knowing the source of his information.  The Minister spoke about travelling throughout Europe but he should bring the Minister for Transport with him to show him the good work done in bottom-up approaches to local government.  Will the Minister tell the House if it is the intention to have regional authority elections in the future, starting with the regional assembly elections in the greater Dublin area next June?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	68	That will be set out in the White Paper.  The Government is considering all matters.  As laid out in the programme for Government, we want to strengthen the strategic role and functions of regional authorities in planning, transport, water and waste management.  Regional authorities should reflect the gateways in the national spatial strategy.  There should also be democratic leadership in order that they can take a critical role in establishing and co-ordinating the new planning regime.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The objective of Government policy on staffing and numbers is to ensure overall staffing levels in the public sector, including local government, are significantly reduced.  With the existing recruitment moratorium, three further schemes have been implemented to support this objective: the special incentive career break scheme, the incentivised scheme of early retirement and the shorter working year scheme.A special incentive career break scheme for local authority employees was introduced earlier this year as part of the Government's efforts to achieve a reduction in spending on the pay bill.  Figures supplied by local authorities, including the regional assemblies, indicate that 295 staff have availed of the scheme from a total of 322 applications received.The incentivised scheme of early retirement was announced by the Minister for Finance in the Budget Statement of 7 April.  The purpose of the scheme was to facilitate the permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the local authorities.  Figures supplied by the local authorities, including the regional assemblies, indicate that 276 staff have availed of the scheme from a total of 312 applications received.The purpose of the shorter working year scheme is to permit local authority employees to balance their working arrangements with outside commitments.  Special leave without pay is available for periods of two, four, six, eight, ten or 13 consecutive weeks.  Both the application period and the scheme are currently open-ended — applicants are free to apply for the scheme at any time.  The information on the numbers availing of the scheme is not available in my Department.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Minister said the purpose of the schemes was to reduce staffing numbers in local authorities and he gave the figures.  However, they are in addition to information I received from him last week on the number of staff employed by local authorities.  There has been a significant reduction in the number of staff working in permanent posts in local authorities, with 550 fewer permanent staff in the country as a whole since June 2008.  These reductions are in addition to huge cutbacks in the numbers of temporary staff in local authorities, with 3,604 fewer staff than in June 2008.  This is because local authorities are trying to keep within budget because the Government has cut local government funding.  Of the counties affected by flooding, Cork County Council has 459 fewer temporary staff and 81 fewer permanent staff and there are similar patterns in Galway, County Clare and Cork city.  Many of these temporary staff would have been outdoor staff who would have been able to help with flood alleviation measures.  Is the Minister aware of the impact on resources of temporary staff cuts arising from the various schemes he outlined?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I am not aware of any such impact.  I am looking at the number of applications approved in the areas affected by floods.  In County Clare the number of applications under the special incentive scheme was eight; in Cork county there were 15 and in County Galway, four; therefore, they will not have an impact.  The number of approvals under the career break scheme in Cork city was 16.  The sector is working to balance the need for reduced staffing levels with the need to provide services to expected levels.  In this context, local authorities have refocused programmes and staffing to priority areas.  They have sought to eliminate and curtail programmes and services of a more discretionary nature and have been active in seeking to support enterprise and protect employment locally by redeploying staff accordingly.  They have continued to provide and maintain a wide range of services, notwithstanding the Government's policy of reducing staffing numbers within the public sector.  Staff have also been redeployed from areas of lower demand to facilitate cost reductions.  Examples include the redeployment of planners to business support units such as in Meath County Council and the redeployment of housing staff from Wicklow County Council to recycling functions in Bray.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I accept the point made by the Minister that the figures are relatively small but the number of staff in Cork County Council is down by 500 since June 2008.  Local authority staff in affected areas made a very reasonable decision to call off their day of action.  They are working extremely hard but it is clear they are under pressure.  Floods are not a new phenomenon but county councils, local authorities and emergency services are working under a lot of pressure.  The number of permanent staff in Clare County Council is down by 44, while the number of temporary staff is down by 19.  Many of the temporary staff, in particular, would be helping to clear roads and drains to deal with the emergency.  These are the practical matters that must be attended to when flooding occurs.  After staff losses, those left behind are under greater pressure.  Will the Minister display flexibility?  Can the councils take on staff specifically to deal with the floods?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	73	This was not intended to be a question on floods.  I record my thanks to local authority members and the emergency services, particularly the Defence Forces and Civil Defence, all of whom have done an outstanding job in the past few days.  Those on the front line include members of the Army which filled 200 sandbags an hour in County Clare and Civil Defence, all of whom are voluntary and not associated with local authorities.  They have done brilliant work on a voluntary basis.  The flood emergency plans worked and it is now a question of cleaning up.  We are in recovery phase.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Will the Minister provide extra resources?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Access to clean drinking water is a priority.  The plant on the Lee Road was submerged.  It must function again as quickly as possible, which we hope will happen by the end of the week.  Resources will be made available to the local authorities.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The annual accounts of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for 2008 have been finalised and arrangements will be made to have them laid before both Houses as soon as possible.  The collapse in international financial and property markets in the past year has created serious challenges for the authority.  The resulting impairment in the values of its property interests and delays in major projects, coupled with the slowdown in housing sales, had serious consequences for the authority's financial standing.  Its accounts for 2008 reflect the very significant financial challenges it faced and show a loss on operations last year of €27 million.  The authority has taken a prudent view on the valuation of its key assets, all of which have been written down.  The accounts show a red book valuation of the Irish Glass Bottle site of €50 million.The authority is taking steps to address its difficult financial position.  All discretionary expenditure on projects and programmes has been cut.  Every cost and overhead is being subjected to rigorous control and scrutiny.  In addition, the authority has put in place a reduced organisational structure that will focus on its critical functions and responsibilities and allow it to continue to achieve its core objectives.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	77	This is one of the greatest scandals we have seen for a long time.  The Minister has been in office for two and a half years.  He refused my request to bring this matter within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the appropriate authority to examine what has gone on in the organisation.  Until today we relied on media reports to discover what was happening.  Will the Government bail out the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, arising from the information provided for the House which shows a €27 million operating loss and a €50 million write-down value on one site?  Is greater oversight of the organisation necessary?  Does the Minister plan to wind it down and subsume it into Dublin City Council or the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  What will be the ultimate cost to the taxpayer of the lack of proper Government practices and the irresponsible deals done in the Dublin docklands area in recent years?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	78	No one has had to rely on media reports.  Any questions put to me have been answered, including those on the Irish Glass Bottle site, the major issue.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	79	It was dragged out of the Minister.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I have said there has been a reduction in value of 85%.  The authority's accounts are audited by an independent external auditor, KPMG.  Under existing legislation, the authority is specifically excluded from being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as are many State and semi-State commercial bodies.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The Minister can change that.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Under existing arrangements, it is open to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to have the authority appear before it and thus afford the Oireachtas an opportunity to question it.  At the request of Deputy Hogan, the committee asked the authority to appear before it next week.  There will be ample opportunity for the Deputy to question it at that point.I have taken decisive action in appointing a new chairman of the authority who has recognised expertise in corporate governance matters.  I believe Deputy Hogan agrees with me on this.  I have asked the new chairman for a report on corporate governance in the authority.  I will keep the need for future involvement by the Comptroller and Auditor General under review.  As pointed out by the Deputy, this would require legislative change.New procedures have been introduced by the new chairman.  There is a new process for carrying out and recording meetings prior to applications being made for a section 25 certificate.  There is also a requirement that, upon receipt, applications undergo initial assessment for completeness and potential non-compliance with the terms of planning schemes.  Site notices must be displayed and registered applications notified to third parties by immediately logging on to the Dublin docklands website.  A process for receiving and acknowledging valid third party submissions has been implemented and there is also a requirement that the planner, when preparing his or her report for the board, take account of the application and any valid third party submission.  There is a series of measures in place.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Dublin Docklands Development Authority was set up to achieve a noble objective, namely, the regeneration of part of the city badly in need of it.  However, it was hijacked by greedy bankers and developers, without oversight or adherence to corporate governance procedures.  Is the Minister saying the people concerned will get away scot-free?  Will there be no investigation by the Minister into the manner in which they carried out their duties?  Will he not publish legislation to include this issue as part of the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Will the stonewalling by the organisation in recent years continue under the Minister?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I am saying the opposite — no stone will be left unturned.  The new chairman is an extremely competent individual and has expertise in corporate governance.  She is going through everything with a fine-tooth comb and has asked outsiders to provide objective analysis.  Two reports are pending, one on finance and the other on planning.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Will the Minister publish them?

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	87	That is a change.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The idea is to have as much openness and transparency as possible to ensure the Dublin Docklands Development Authority which the Deputy acknowledges has done good work in regeneration of the area can continue to do this work but in a way that is open, transparent, competent and efficient.  That is my aim and it is shared by most Members of the House.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Ireland is a non-nuclear state.  The Government does not believe nuclear power is the answer to our energy needs and would prefer to see greater emphasis on renewable energy sources.  As a non-nuclear state, Ireland does not stand to receive any of the claimed benefits from the current wave of developments in nuclear energy but must still bear any trans-boundary risks that might arise from these facilities.  In view of this, the Government continues to press for the fullest possible information from the UK authorities on any activities that might contribute to that risk.My Department is in regular contact with the relevant UK Departments and agencies on nuclear safety and radiological protection matters.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland also has regular contact with the regulatory bodies responsible for radiological protection and nuclear safety in the United Kingdom and meets frequently with my Department to discuss these matters.  Through these ongoing contacts, I am informed of key policy developments with regard to nuclear power in the United Kingdom, including the proposals recently published for consultation on the planned development of new nuclear power stations.  Arising from my concern and that of the Government at this proposal, I raised the issue during a meeting last week with the UK ambassador.  I have asked my Department to follow up on the matter at a meeting with the relevant UK authorities this week and seek information, predominantly on any safety and waste issues associated with the proposals.  My Department's priority in all discussions with the United Kingdom on its nuclear energy programme is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, particularly the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	90	In May 2008 the Minister stated a new structure had been set up at European level, namely, the European high level regulatory group, and that this was a significant development in policing the safety issues surrounding the Sellafield plant and other installations on the west coast of the United Kingdom.  Has this group met or does the Minister have information on the number of times it has met?  What has been its level of activity in ensuring the Irish Government's concerns are being taken on board?I understand the Minister recently received a large report from the British Embassy.  Has he issued a response to the British authorities arising from that report?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	91	In response to the last question, no report has been received by me on the matter.  As soon as I receive one, I will issue a response.On the question of groups which have met, I met colleagues representing the non-nuclear states in Vienna.  I hope another meeting will be planned shortly.  It is important that the non-nuclear states combine because they are all threatened in various ways from their neighbouring states in Europe which have nuclear facilities.  It is essential that the planned development of nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom proceed according to the highest possible safety standards.  Moreover, it is to be expected that nuclear safety regulations will subject new reactor designs to robust scrutiny and that safety issues will be the subject of dialogue between industry and the regulators aimed at ensuring the complete safety of designs that might be approved.  I note that concerns were raised about the reactor designs under consideration for approval in the United Kingdom.  This will be one of the issues that will be raised tomorrow at the aforementioned meeting.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I seek clarification.  When the Minister spoke about being committed to safe decommissioning at Sellafield in May 2008, he mentioned that at EU level, Ireland was supporting efforts by the European Commission to develop an increased safety role across the nuclear industry.  He stated the adoption of recent European Council conclusions on the establishment of a European Union high level regulators group was a significant development in the field of nuclear safety.  If this was a significant development, I would expect the group to have met a couple of times.  Has it met and, if so, how many times?  Were the Minister or his officials in attendance to report back on what was deemed to be a highly significant development in May 2008?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The only meeting I attended was the one in Vienna to which I have referred.  I have not received any other invitations from my Department to attend other meetings.  However, I make it my business to attend such meetings on receiving invitations because I consider this to be a major issue.  When I spoke on it recently, I also noted that many of the new reactor designs were still in their infancy.  While I would be happy to have a debate in the House on nuclear issues at any time, all the evidence suggests there would be no advantage for this country in going down the nuclear path.  We would not receive any benefit and until such time as the crucial waste issue is dealt with, I do not foresee a future in this country for nuclear power.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	94	As a matter of courtesy, the Minister might establish whether the aforementioned group exists; whether it has met and, if so, the number of times.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I will.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	96	More than 1,400 prospective purchasers have formally registered interest on the dedicated home choice loan website and, to date, 44 applications have been made.  Of these applications, 27 have been declined and four approved, with two loans now drawn down.  Three applications have been withdrawn, while a decision is pending on ten applications, on which further information has been sought from the applicant.The scheme is operated by four local authorities acting on a regional basis with administrative support from a central processing unit in the affordable homes partnership.  Total costs of approximately €280,000 have been incurred to date in establishing the scheme which have been met from within existing resources.  The projected costs for the remainder of 2009 and 2010 are €10,000 and €20,000, respectively.  A significant element of the total cost was incurred in the development of the loan processing model that applies to the home choice loan but which has also now been used in the development of revised systems for processing and credit checking of normal local authority house purchase loan applications under other schemes such as the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes.  In addition, it is expected that ongoing administrative costs will be met from normal lending margins.The scheme is targeted at creditworthy first-time buyers of new houses only.  As I have indicated on a number of occasions since it was introduced, the focus on new houses was intended to reflect the fact that the significant majority of first-time buyers had tended to opt to purchase new houses.  However, I have also stated consistently that the terms of the scheme will be kept under review and that particular attention will be paid to any changes in purchasing tendencies among first-time buyers generally.  More recent data suggest the purchasing tendencies of first-time buyers have shifted significantly in recent months, with the majority now tending to purchase second-hand homes, possibly as a result of improved affordability on foot of price decreases and historically low interest rates.  Therefore, I have instructed my Department to make arrangements allowing for the extension of the home choice scheme to include second-hand houses.  I do not expect additional administrative costs to arise from the extension of the scheme.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	97	As the Minister of State will acknowledge, the numbers involved are extremely low.  A total of 1,400 prospective purchasers have formally registered an interest, of whom only 3%, or 44, have made applications and only two loans have been drawn down thus far.  As the numbers are not stacking up, customers are not voting with their feet and homeowners are not satisfied with the loan scheme, will the Minister of State consider winding it down?  It is almost one year old.  The Minister of State should consider other initiatives such as the incremental purchase scheme, as well as revising the shared ownership scheme.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	98	While I appreciate the points made by the Deputy, I remind him that I also introduced the incremental purchase scheme.  I do not intend to close down the scheme and, as I noted, I intend to extend it as and from 1 January 2010 to the second-hand house market.  The scheme is in place with no incentive.  The most important reason for its existence is to support people who wish to buy a house and who could make repayments on it but who lack the deposit sought from them by many financial institutions.  It is in place as an alternative and the information available to me does not show there is as much credit available in the mortgage area as people would wish.  In addition, it is important to recognise there is no great sentiment in the market for the purchasing of houses.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Given that the scheme is not working, the Minister of State should advise Members as to the initiatives he is taking to ensure the banks will begin to lend again to potential homeowners.  I ask him to revert to the House in the new year with new initiatives to help people.

The Deputy will acknowledge that capital injections have been made into the main banks.

My officials and I have regular meetings with the Irish Banking Federation and my decision to extend the loans scheme to second-hand houses is based on its data.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 88 together.The European Court of Justice recently ruled that Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 4 and 8 of the 1975 waste directive as regards domestic wastewaters disposed of in the countryside through septic tanks and other individual wastewater treatment systems.  The renewed programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a scheme for the licensing and inspection of septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems.  My Department which has established a task force to consider the matter will develop proposals to give effect to this commitment and respond in full to the court judgment.  The Department's initial assessment is that compliance with the ruling will require new legislation that will set standards for the performance of all individual wastewater treatment systems, provide for periodic inspection by a competent person, establish penalties for non-compliance and provide for corrective measures where a system is found to be defective.  My Department is required to submit to the European Commission by the end of December formal proposals on how it proposes to achieve compliance with the judgment and to set out a timeframe for compliance.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I am supportive of anything we can do to improve the quality of groundwater which is in a very poor state in many parts of the country.  I draw the Minister's attention to an excellent report by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It arises from a number of presentations made by interested parties.  Deputy Ciarán Lynch and I participated in the process and are supportive of the outcome which is long overdue.  Will the Minister indicate how long it will be before the scheme is rolled out?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The task force has approximately two months to produce a set of proposals.  It will comprise officials from my Department, the local authorities and the EPA.  We must then go through a legislative process.  Due to the pressure on us, rightly, because of the severity of the problem, I hope the legislation will be passed within a year.  It is absolutely essential.  According to the CSO, there are approximately 418,000 septic tanks.  I believe that is a conservative estimate because it does not take into account many of the commercial premises and so forth that rely on septic tanks.  Many of the septic tanks in place should never have been approved, as the soil conditions were completely wrong.  There was a degree of irresponsibility on the part of planners at local authority level.  The numbers involved are incredible but we must take this problem in hand.  We must have a situation where there is no threat to our groundwater from badly functioning septic tanks.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Deputy Hogan has referred to the work done by the joint committee on this issue.  Both he and I were present for a visit to the committee by people involved in the septic tank industry who provided the Department with a report.  One of the significant aspects of that report was the call for regulation.  We had a bizarre situation where the industry was seeking regulation from the Government.  How long has the report been on the Minister's desk?  How long has the industry been seeking regulation?  When will it be granted?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	107	There is nothing bizarre about the industry seeking regulation as it stands to benefit from such regulation.  I have met industry representatives who have shown me the latest equipment, how it functions and how it can be installed quickly in an existing septic tank.  There is much innovation in the industry, members of which are delighted that at long last there is a Minister interested in this subject because it has been a problem over successive Administrations.  It did not just arise in the last two years or so but has been present for some time and people have failed to tackle it.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Tell everyone that.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	109	It is a fact.  Various Administrations have failed to tackle the problem, although we have known about it for some time.  However, this Government will tackle it.  There is a real commitment to doing so.  I have given that commitment today and gave it previously in the renewed programme for Government.  The report of the joint committee on the issue was good.  However, it makes a few recommendations which will not be implemented, one of them being the provision of an incentive through a grant to upgrade tanks.  Given the scale of the problem and the number of septic tanks involved, that is not possible.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The Minister has said formal proposals must be submitted to the Commission by the end of the year.  Will they be submitted to the Commission, following which legislation will be brought before the House and a gun put to our heads because the Minister will say it has already been agreed with the Commission?  Will it be another case of the cart being put before the horse or will we have a direct input into it?What efforts are being made to inform people how they can properly utilise and maintain a septic tank?  Basic information is not being provided for the public on the ongoing usage and maintenance of a septic tank.  What investment is taking place to develop the technology to install new systems such as seed bacteria or small reed beds that can solve many of these problems cost effectively?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I am glad the Deputy has referred to that innovation.  I have spoken to people such as Éamon de Buitléar and others who believe we do not need hard engineering solutions but can use the reed bed technologies which work very effectively.  It is something we will have to explore to a greater extent, particularly in small connurbations where they can be very effective.To refer to the Deputy's earlier point, I am not putting a gun to anybody's head.  We have been put under pressure, rightly so, by this court judgment.  We must produce legislation.  Deputies will have adequate time when the legislation is being debated in the House to make their feelings known and make proposals.  That is the proper way to proceed.  If the Deputy has ideas, I will be more than happy to discuss them with him if he believes it would be helpful.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	112	This issue is frightening for my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and other areas such as County Leitrim where soil types are difficult.  I am glad to hear the Minister mention that developments such as reed bed technology can be extremely successful, as they have been beside my home.  We must be given a commitment that nothing will be done that will make housing impossible in rural areas.  Houses in my parish of Aghabog and similar places have been there for generations.  The real problem is in areas such as Castleblayney where 700 houses have been built and connected with an existing sewage treatment plant that is incapable of dealing with it.  It is going directly into the lake.  That is also the situation in several other areas.  We should not seek to concentrate on the small person and ignore the issues that we, as legislators, and the Government should deal with.

It is beyond me.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The Minister is answering the question.  The Deputy is supposed to pose questions.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	116	The Deputy did not mention it but the judgment was very interesting with regard to the position in County Cavan.  It specifically mentions the county in a good way because it points out that it is the only county that has by-laws relating to this issue.  We must first put such by-laws in place.  Notwithstanding this, it is clear that we must introduce specific legislation to deal with the issue.  I hope there is a recognition on all sides of the House that it must be dealt with.  Otherwise, regardless of who is in government, we will face very hefty fines.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	117	To support the implementation of the 2007 report by Mr. John Fitzgerald entitled, Addressing Issues of Social Exclusion in Moyross and Other Disadvantaged Areas of Limerick City, I made an order extending the boundary of Limerick City Council in February 2008 which extended the city area by approximately one third.  The new boundary became effective from 1 March 2008.  The extension was supported by Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council.  At the time I particularly welcomed the co-operation and agreement between the two councils on the issue.The Green Paper on local government, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, which I published in April 2008, raised the question as to whether change in local government arrangements was necessary in key locations, including Limerick, to drive regional development.  The Green Paper noted that part of the challenge was to ensure local government would be capable of developing and facilitating the development of the gateways as envisaged by the national spatial strategy.  It suggested a number of possible solutions in this regard.Consensus has not emerged at local level on more substantial change to the Limerick city boundary, as sought by the city council.  However, there is a need for much greater coherence in the governance of Limerick and my Department has been considering the issues involved in Limerick as part of the process of finalising the White Paper on local government.  The renewed programme for Government is also relevant to this question.  The programme commits to the provision of democratic leadership for regional authorities and the strengthening of their strategic role across a range of functions, in addition to their realignment to reflect the gateways in the national spatial strategy.  These considerations lie at the heart of my thinking on local government.  The Government is giving active consideration to a range of local government issues, including how best to provide for the optimal arrangements for the governance of Limerick.  I hope to make an announcement in this regard in the near future.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I note the Minister in reply to this and previous questions has moved away substantially from local government and devolution since the local elections.  I wonder why.  Regional authorities, gateway status and other buzzwords are coming to the fore in his language.  This issue boils down to finance between Limerick city and county local authorities and how such an issue can be overcome within a county.  Does the Minister agree it is better to achieve consensus on the financial package to compensate local authorities within a county?  Does he also agree it is not appropriate without consensus to cross a boundary into another county, as was the case in Limerick and south Kilkenny in recent times?

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Deputy Hogan is aware that I referred to that issue when I visited Kilkenny recently.  These are sensitive issues, which is why it took so long to approve the boundary extension which I announced in March 2008.  The Deputy's analysis is correct in that much of this comes down to the rates base.  Cities are the driving force in developing local government and regions, as recognised in all the international literature.  Strong cities must be developed.  I agree with that point of view.The metropolitan area of Limerick is governed by three separate local authorities.  Many have acknowledged that this has led to incoherence in gateway leadership and regional planning.  This has produced a weak regional planning framework, resulting in significant downstream opportunity costs, competition between local authorities to attract commercial retail development, resulting in inappropriate developments, as is clear from visiting the city, and relationships between local authorities that do not demonstrate the desired level of co-operation and mutual understanding to the detriment of the region as a whole.  An interim report of the mid-west task force also stated we needed to address this issue as a matter of urgency.  Limerick is a special case, which is why we need to address it.

This comprises 1,281 properties in respect of which full funding approval has issued and a further 316 units in respect of which provisional approval has issued.  A number of other proposals are also under consideration by my Department.I will circulate in the Official Report a table showing the breakdown by housing authority of the 1,281 properties in respect of which full funding approval has issued.  The average leasing cost in respect of these units is just over €390 per month.  However, the majority of these units are unsold affordable dwellings, where the average cost would be less than if they were either leased by housing authorities from the private sector or provided directly by approved bodies.  Therefore, the average cost is likely to increase as other projects are progressed.  The lease period in respect of the unsold affordable units is five years, while in all other cases the lease is for a minimum of ten years.  The 1,281 units involved comprise 193 one bed units, 613 two bed units and 475 units with three bedrooms or more.The issue of including break clauses in lease agreements is a matter for housing authorities and approved housing bodies to deal with as part of their negotiation process.  My Department has, however, issued guidance to authorities advising them to exercise caution in making provision for break clauses and that where such clauses are agreed, the authority concerned must be satisfied that it will be able to rehouse the occupant in the event of the option being exercised.Overall, I am pleased with the progress being made in rolling out the new leasing initiative.  With 1,600 units approved, the initiative which I only introduced in February this year is becoming a crucial delivery mechanism in meeting housing need, particularly in the context of the prevailing constrained fiscal environment.  I have recently announced the extension of the leasing arrangements to the voluntary and co-operative sector which will further accelerate activity under the initiative.  I am confident the target to source 2,000 units under the leasing arrangements in 2009 will be substantially achieved by year end.Housing authority areaNo of approved with full funding approval for leasingCork County Council415Dublin City Council365Fingal County Council97Kildare County Council56Laois County Council56Mayo County Council20Meath County Council74Offaly County Council21South Dublin County Council100Templemore Town Council20Wexford County Council14Westmeath County Council43Total1,281

Therefore, the figure is not drawn specifically from privately owned accommodation leased by the Department.  Does the figure also include affordable homes?
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Yes.

They cannot be included because there is no charge on these properties in the first instance.  Is that correct?
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	129	We expect the cost to increase because we will deal more with the private market.  However, a cost is associated with affordable housing because there are loan costs for each local authority.  I accept the figure is possibly not the market rent applicable to private properties at this time.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	130	That is a significant change.  My question referred to vacant properties leased from developers and private entities, not local authorities.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State broke down the figures in this regard.  Behind my supplementary question is a belief that a serious examination needs to be carried out of the merits of this initiative.  I have written to the Comptroller and Auditor General asking him to undertake this examination and hope the figures provided for that office will not be skewed by the affordable home scheme figures I received this afternoon.  In recent weeks we have witnessed a significant drop in rents in the open market.  Given the direction to local authorities in this matter that they should a figure of 20% below the current rent payable with regard to when leases were acquired, have further leases been taken out, given that rents are falling further?  Are local authorities tied into lease agreements in excess of current rental figures?  Is there a break out clause whereby rents can be reviewed downwards?  What is the minimum period at which those break out clauses are set?

Local authorities have an entitlement to a review, both upwards and downwards.  We indicated to them that they should look for a 20% reduction in the current market because we are leasing multiple units.  It is very important that I achieve the best possible value for the State.  I do not make any apologies for asking local authorities to enter negotiations to achieve value for the taxpayer.

That is only appropriate and what we would expect.  The matter of affordability is of benefit to the taxpayer at this time, as the amount we are paying covers loan repayments.  We are putting national infrastructure into public use with good value, which is important.  Local authorities have the outline and instructions from the Department.  We have ongoing contact with them.  I am very pleased with the level of activity and for the past two months the provision has been extended to the voluntary sector, which will accelerate the long-term leasing initiative.

He has acknowledged that the inclusion of affordable homes in the figure is skewing it and driving down the cost.  Given that rents are continuously dropping, is the value of some of the leases entered into in excess of the rental agreement figures that can be acquired currently?

Anybody will accept that the maximum figure paid by any local authority is €550 per month.  That compares very favourably on a national basis, including Dublin and Cork.  However, the figure can be as low as €299.  I will provide the figures for the administrative costs because I do not have them readily available.  I will ask my officials to make the information available to the Deputy.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	137	The events of the past week in respect of weather conditions and the havoc wreaked on thousands of homes, lives, careers and opportunities have been unprecedented.  While the Government is not responsible for the extent of the rainfall, it is responsible for the response to this calamity.  As I understand from reports from the ESB, this is a once in 800 years event and water levels on the River Shannon and at other locations are above the worst disaster levels ever recorded in 1954.  The Taoiseach took time to visit a number of the affected locations yesterday but I have received written reports from all of our Deputies and Senators in affected locations from Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Galway and other places.  This is a horrendous position as we face into Christmas.  The people affected need help now.  It ranges from the call from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for basics such as boots, clothes and blankets to assistance for the agricultural community which has simply been devastated and wiped out.  Five weeks before Christmas businesses have found that their livelihoods are completely gone.  Short of a family tragedy, there is nothing worse for a housewife in the country than to see the family home under five feet of water.  The Taoiseach knows this from first-hand encounters yesterday.  It requires swift, decisive and effective Government action in response.I know the Cabinet met this morning to discuss the matter and was briefed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House what is the response of the Government and what help is being prepared by it for businesses which have been devastated, owners whose houses have been flooded and are awash with sewage and everything else and farmers whose livelihoods have literally been washed away?  What is the Government's response, given the visual evidence the Taoiseach witnessed and the reports of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I agree that in recent days we have seen weather conditions which have wreaked devastation and caused problems in many places.  The flooding is causing many problems in certain areas and continues to be monitored.  The insurance policies people have on their homes and businesses will take effect.  With regard to those in exceptional need or experiencing hardship as a result of what has happened, community welfare officers are available — including today — on a one-to-one basis to assist those who require food, clothing, bedding, etc.  In addition, there has been a decision made by the Government to open an additional fund, starting at €10 million, for humanitarian assistance.  A clean-up operation will begin in the coming days, assuming the situation does not deteriorate further, for which we will be watching weather patterns in the days ahead.  Once the clean-up operation proceeds, other needs which people may have will emerge but the humanitarian aid scheme will assist those suffering most hardship.The question of fodder relief also arises.  Cattle are being moved to higher ground.  Teagasc and other agencies will make an assessment on a county-by-county basis, using front-line knowledge to determine what can be achieved.  The initial decision has been taken to make funds available and assessments will be made on a daily and weekly basis of what further assistance can be provided.The response to the emergency involves local emergency plans, in which agencies and the various authorities have worked well together, and central plans, in respect of which an emergency co-ordination committee has met on an ongoing basis since last Friday when the crisis emerged.  The Government is anxious to assist those suffering particular hardship in every way we can and to look at how we can ensure the flooding abates and does not continue in the days ahead.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The indications are that weather conditions may well deteriorate again this evening.  The Government has pumped hundreds of millions of euro into loans that did not perform and which have now ended up in a black hole.  In this case, thousands of people who were prepared to put their money where their mouths were have had their lives destroyed.  They followed their own initiative to follow a business lead and provide career opportunities for themselves, their families and children.  In farming circles people followed instructions and attempted to make a livelihood for themselves in very difficult circumstances.  For thousands of householders their pride and joy has turned to devastation as water bubbles up through the floors and pours into the house.The Government states it is anxious to assist but I ask for something far more effective than this.  I know the Taoiseach cannot provide a full, detailed response on structural damage to bridges, key walls or other defences but we need to be able to offer the people some hope the Government actually understands what they are facing up to in the last five weeks of the year.  When the landslide occurred on the north Mayo coast, it was almost two and a half years before people could draw down assistance through the Red Cross.What has happened in recent days is unprecedented.  At 4.30 p.m. on this dark evening, people are facing into a night of the unknown.  Nobody knows where water may strike in the Shannon basin or on its lower plains, in Cork or the Lee valley or the towns throughout the southern region.  It requires a serious Government response — now.  I hope the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, will tell the House later what he said to the Government this morning.  He should take on board suggestions from Members on all sides who have heard first-hand reports that neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach have been able to get around to in the time available.The people whose livelihoods have been washed away before their eyes and who now want to rebuild their lives and careers and opportunities for their families need a more effective response from the Government.  Has the Taoiseach applied for assistance under the European solidarity fund?  That is a fund of €1 billion but assistance has to be applied for by the Government.  It has been used to provide assistance for countries such as Romania and Greece after wildfires.  I ask the Taoiseach to be more expansive and show more generosity to those who have to rebuild careers, livelihoods and opportunities in the agriculture sector, including housewives and all others affected.  Does he intend to send the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to meet regional Commissioner Samecki to discuss urgently the provision of funds in addition to what the Government is providing for hard-pressed families in this unprecedented situation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I have made it clear, as I did yesterday when I visited areas affected by the flood, that the Government will see what it can do to assist in every way it can.  Businesses are in the process of cleaning up and, as far as is possible, opening again, although some are, of course, waiting for the flood waters to abate in order that they can return to their premises.  There are insurance issues to deal with but some householders have been flooded for the first time because of the rainfall and its effect on the river basins and they need immediate help with food, clothing and bedding.  In some cases accommodation is provided by family members nearby and the HSE is stepping in to provide temporary accommodation where required.  The situation is being monitored and when the flood waters abate and the clean-up operation takes place, people will assess the extent of the damage and to what extent it is covered by existing insurance arrangements.  The immediate response of the Government has been to make sure a funding line is available to deal with the situation as it arises.  Community welfare officers are making sure local, front-line knowledge is put to best effect to make sure people with immediate needs are helped in as speedy and flexible a way as possible.The Minister for Finance is making inquiries as to the possibility of funds being made available from the EU solidarity fund.  We will provide assistance in whatever way we can but agricultural relief such as a fodder scheme will have to be proceeded with in line with state aid rules, to which end we are seeking clearance from the Agriculture Directorate General.  I met yesterday with businesspeople who had reopened their businesses that afternoon having been flooded over the weekend, while others were not in a position to do so.  The position varies from business to business and depends on the type of business involved and how it has been affected.  People are trying to get back to as normal a position as quickly as possible.  We have made humanitarian aid available immediately for those most affected.  There is a wider range of issues around flood management and various flood relief schemes such as those in Mallow, Carrick-on-Suir and Kilkenny have been effective.  There is a further commitment to investment in these areas.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	141	It is fair to say there was an immediate response to the emergency over the weekend but it came from local authorities, Civil Defence, local bodies, neighbours and others who came together to help each other out in what was an unprecedented weather event.It is something, however, that we will probably have to learn to cope with.I listened to the Taoiseach's replies to Deputy Kenny and he said that the Government would assist in every way it can.  The point, however, is that the Government needs to take charge of this matter.  A number of things need to be done.  First, there is the urgent matter of restoring drinking water supplies.  Approximately 18,000 households in Cork do not have drinking water at the moment.  Second, there are the immediate needs of people who have had to evacuate their homes due to flooding.  They require short-term accommodation and assistance to repair their flooded homes.  The question of insurance also arises in this respect.  Somebody in the Government needs to talk to the insurance industry immediately to ensure that claims are processed promptly and that insurance companies are not holding back on such claims.  In addition, people affected by the floods will need financial assistance while their insurance claims are pending.  We know from our experience of past cases that it can take some time before insurance claims are paid.  In the current economic circumstances, many households and businesses may not have access to alternative funding sources, either to get houses repaired or businesses restocked in the run up to Christmas.  Financial assistance is needed even in the form of advance payments anticipating claims that will eventually be paid by insurance companies.I appreciate it is early days but I am not sure the fund announced today is adequate, or that the method for accessing it is appropriate in all cases.  It seems to me that €12 million will not go very far, given the scale of devastation we have seen in recent days.  I would like to hear more about the role of community welfare officers.  I suspect that people who have gone through the trauma of having their homes flooded will not necessarily want a vigorous means test from a community welfare officer.  On what basis will those officers extend this funding?What will be done to accelerate flood protection projects to ensure that as many people as possible can be protected from a recurrence of these events?  It is fair to assume that if there is a repeat of these weather conditions the areas that suffered flooding this time will also suffer again if flood protection measures are not taken.  We know, for example, that the measures taken in places such as Kilkenny, Mallow and elsewhere have worked.  It is, therefore, urgent to accelerate flood protection works so that the next time around the damage will be minimised.There are also longer-term issues, which were well expressed at the weekend by the IFA president, including drainage and water courses.  These matters require attention.  I appreciate that the recent rainfall was unprecedented, but we have been talking about reducing carbon emissions in the context of climate change.  The reality is that the effects of climate change are now with us, yet we do not seem to have been adequately prepared to deal with the consequences.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I do not accept Deputy Gilmore's first contention, which is that there was no national response.  There has been a good level of co-ordination as a result of the establishment of the emergency planning office some years ago.  Those plans are in place precisely to meet such situations.  There is good inter-agency co-ordination, which provides a quick response when an emergency arises.  We should not be awaiting a response from a central Department about how to deal with a particular situation in west Cork, east Galway or elsewhere.  That is not the way to get a quick and effective response.  Local authorities, at city and county level, are the leading agencies in these matters.  They bring together the various local agencies that are involved, including the Army, Civil Defence, Garda Síochána and Health Service Executive.  The HSE has issued public health notices and other information where required.  There is a need to safeguard major installations such as water pumping stations where possible and hospitals, as well as helping those in difficulty in flooded housing estates and other locations.  The public accepted that sense of prioritised co-ordination, which was fundamental in ensuring an effective response.  In fairness, people have been working 24/7 since last Thursday evening.  The work has been undertaken in a co-ordinated fashion and I believe it has a lot of public support.A co-operative community spirit lies behind many of the efforts that are being made.  These include contacting and protecting vulnerable people to ensure that they have access to drinking water.  Local community groups are calling to homes to augment and facilitate those efforts in line with the emergency teams already in place.  All that work must be recognised and commended.  Given that those efforts were structured locally, it meant the response was far better than if it had originated at a centralised level.In addition, the emergency co-ordination committee has a responsibility to pull all that work together to see what priorities emerge.  That committee must ensure that the necessary resources are made available, including personnel.  The Defence Forces, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and other agencies must have an overview of what is happening, while people locally work non-stop to deal with the situation as it arises.  That co-ordination has worked.  Clearly, however, the challenge continues and changes daily from location to location.  Somewhere that was not too badly affected yesterday could be in serious difficulty today, so the situation is being monitored continually.It is incumbent on the insurance industry to provide a speedy response.  I have already met people who have had insurance inspectors in to estimate the cost of repairing flood damage.  In addition, community welfare officers are making funds available to those in difficulty.  I am not suggesting that this morning's announcement concerning the €12 million fund represents the Government's full response, but we must open the fund to ensure that moneys are available in addition to urgent needs and exceptional needs payments.  The latter payments are already being provided to families who can establish to the satisfaction of officials that they have immediate needs, such as clothing, bedding or food.What is being provided is not compensation, but humanitarian relief for those in immediate difficulties.  Business losses do not come into that category.  It is a matter that will have to be dealt with by the insurance industry itself.  Business people are currently in the process of getting back up and running for the Christmas period where flooding has abated in certain towns.We all share the sense of urgency about the floods and we all accept that it has been a very difficult situation for many communities in a short space of time.  It should be acknowledged that everybody who had a responsibility to discharge has done so excellently in the best traditions of the public service.  They are doing so on an ongoing basis.  I commend everyone for that.  A resilient community spirit is also assisting these efforts to alleviate and mitigate the undoubted hardships for many families in the affected areas.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	144	At the outset I acknowledged the response of the local authorities, voluntary bodies and communities.  I also acknowledged that the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government visited a number of affected areas in recent days.  All I am doing is highlighting a number of matters in respect of which attention is required.I accept that some insurance companies have responded quickly to people's needs.  However, I have been contacted by individuals whose insurance companies are reluctant to provide cover because their premises or properties were flooded on previous occasions.  I have also been contacted by those whose mortgages are in arrears and who are concerned with regard to what will happen because their mortgage and insurance payments are tied together.  Further, I have been contacted by business people who are concerned about getting their operations up and running again, restocking their shelves, etc., in order that they might capitalise on increases in trade in the period leading up to Christmas.  This aspect of the matter must be addressed and someone in the Government should enter discussions with the insurance companies in the interests of ensuring that there will be no blockages in the system.My other question relates to flood protection works.  I do not know if it is ever possible for people's lives to return to normal following events such as those which have occurred in recent days.  While one might clean out and return to live in one's house or get one's business up and running again, the fear always remains that one's property will be flooded in the future.  The only way concerns in this regard will be allayed is if people are informed that flood protection works will be put in place.The Government should accelerate the programme of flood protection works.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, gave a number of interviews in recent days during which he outlined the different stages at which various flood protection works currently stand.  Such works should be accelerated in order that people might have as much peace of mind as possible to the effect that everything necessary is being done and that if there is a recurrence of the recent bad weather, the effects of it will be minimised.

On flood protection works, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has visited many areas throughout the country in order to discharge his responsibilities in respect of this matter.  Significant funding is being made available.  Some €100 million was provided during the past five years.  Despite our difficult financial position, some €38 million has already been allocated this year.  We want to accord priority to flood relief and protection.

As matters stand, there will be a need for an investment of €50 million per annum and that is before any review takes place in respect of recent events.  There will be a need to identify and prioritise.  I am acutely aware that there are certain parts of the country where flooding is a problem on every occasion it rains heavily.  I am acutely aware of the problems posed perennially by flooding of the River Shannon.  This year, those problems will be far worse because——

Well done to him.  I stress that this is a more medium to long-term issue.  It is also a capital works issue and it must be addressed.  The immediate priority is that those who are experiencing hardship must be assisted.  Members of the agricultural community are also experiencing difficulties as a result of recent events.  We must also continue with the scheme of capital works.With regard to the other matters raised by Deputies Gilmore and Kenny, various needs are emerging.  As such needs are assessed, a response will be forthcoming, but we need to do that in a way that does not put the Government in loco the insurance industry.  There are contingencies that are insurable and that are covered and which will rightly have to be discharged.  Taxpayers and the Government have to step in where necessary to alleviate hardship and ensure that people’s short-term needs are met as they seek to return to normality as the emergency passes.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I object to the Order of Business.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Dáil sits until 9.50 p.m. and that we have a three-hour debate on the consequences of flooding, including 30 minutes of questions and answers with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Fine Gael will set aside its Private Member's time between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m., No. 43. should be taken for 80 minutes from 8.30 p.m. and the debate on agriculture should be postponed until Thursday.  I do not want this to be like the landings at Dunkirk.This is a matter of extreme importance to people.  We have listened on umpteen occasions to members of the Government talking about Dáil reform.  As we sit in the comfort of this leather lined Chamber, people are under five feet of water in their homes, businesses and on their farms.  This reflects a gulf, which is filled with anger and misgiving because Government support has evaporated.  Today is the halfway point of the Government, which took up office on 24 May 2007.  Its integrity is in shreds, its credibility is in tatters and it has lost the moral authority to lead.If the Government cannot respond in this House to give Members, who represent farmers, housewives, young people and everybody else, the opportunity to speak up and give the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Government the facts of life from village, town and city, then we will have failed in our duty.  We talk about Dáil reform.  Here is an opportunity to allow for a three-hour debate led off by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Every Member should have ten minutes, which would be followed by a question and answer session, to give the Minister further information in order that he would have a more complete and deeper analysis of what is happening.  If we are not able to do that, the House will have failed in its duty to people who this evening are in darkness and who are worried, concerned and anxious because they do not know where the next flood will come from or what will happen.Despite the good work of the emergency services and the local authorities, it is an important function in our democracy that the representatives of the people in the House of Parliament be enabled to speak out on an issue that is unprecedented and that is a once in 800 years happening.  The River Shannon is a foot and a half higher than it was in 1954.If the Ceann Comhairle thinks this is not worthy of consideration under Standing Order 32, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party, the Green Party, the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party, Independent Members and Sinn Féin be enabled to speak out and inform the Minister and Government of how important a matter this is.

They know, as we do, that on an occasion like this a Private Members' debate does not deal with the issue because the Minister will not answer questions in that debate.

I ask the Ceann Comhairle and the Government to accept my amendment as it in everybody's interest to do so.  We should set aside the business planned and deal with the issue that has most relevance for people, even as the rain continues to pour from the sky as we speak.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The amendment is in order because it proposes that the Dáil should sit longer than is proposed on the Order of Business.  Private Members' business today is in the name of the Fine Gael Party.  We are prepared to set that aside in the interest of a complete, thorough, full and open debate where the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can answer questions in respect of observations made by Deputies from Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  If we cannot do this, then let the Whip not come in here and talk about Dáil reform.  This issue is relevant to thousands of people regarding their houses, their businesses and careers and for the social comfort of so many whose floors are lifting before their eyes even as we speak.  It is about time this Chamber began to be relevant to the needs of our people.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	242	On behalf of the Labour Party, I support the proposal made by Deputy Kenny.  This is an extraordinary day and we have an emergency in the country.  People's homes have been flooded and many of those whose homes have not been flooded to date fear they will be in trouble.  There is a huge problem.  I appreciate there is a motion down for debate at Private Members' time, but that is a restricted form of debate which is limited to those proposing the motion, a Minister responding and a few other speakers if we are lucky.This is not a day when we can do business as usual.  It is a day when one part of the country is under water and when virtually every public office and service in the State is closed down in an industrial dispute.  Is it seriously being suggested in the national Parliament that Members, who represent constituencies that are under water and people whose homes have been flooded and whose businesses have been ruined and who are frightened about what faces them, cannot debate the matter here?  Deputy Kenny and I raised this issue on Leaders' questions.  We did not do this in an adversarial way but in order to respond to the situation and to try to get some response from Government.  It is reasonable that Members who represent constituencies and people directly affected by this should have the opportunity to debate the issue and have their say on it in Government time, not Private Members' time.Deputy Kenny has proposed a formula whereby that can be done.  I support that, but I would make one slight change.  I think we could deal with the statements on the industrial dispute immediately after the Order of Business.  This would, among other things, allow the Ministers who must deal with the emergency situation to prepare for the debate and take advice or do whatever is necessary.  This small alteration in the order in which we deal with the issue might be acceptable.  This is not a business as usual day.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to agree, on behalf of the Government, to allow us deal with this issue.  It is unthinkable that Members must go back to their constituencies and face people whose homes have been flooded, businesses ruined and their farms left under water and when they are asked whether they raised the matter to have to reply they are sorry but they could not because of the rules of the House.  People will find that laughable.  It will make this House and the institutional Parliament a laughing stock and irrelevant.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to agree to the proposal made by Deputy Kenny, with the adjustment I have suggested, and that we get on and deal with the issue.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	288	First, I would like to say how deeply disappointed I and the other members of the Government are that the public service unions have decided to take this action today.  I believe this action is causing serious disruption and inconvenience to the public, such as the users of our hospitals, those receiving social welfare benefits, schoolchildren and their parents as well as wider economic loss across the State at this critical time in our country's history.The action is taking place at a time when the best of the public service has been on display — in Cork, in Galway and every other place where its help has been so badly needed.  We have seen nurses, doctors and support staff respond instantly to move patients out of harm's way in hospitals.  We have seen the Coast Guard rescue those in peril from their homes.  We have seen staff in local authorities deliver essential supplies of drinking water.  We have seen members of the Defence Forces perform many varied tasks and confirm the affection in which they are held in our national life.  We have seen members of the Garda Síochána go beyond the call of their duty.Members of the public service unions in those areas that have been most hard hit have responded to this crisis by putting aside their day of action and ensuring that they will be at work today, which I welcome.  I do not believe today's action in any way advances the possibility of finding a basis of agreement about managing the public service pay cost in this unprecedented economic crisis.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has stated that the Government has forced it to take this action.  I regret that is incorrect.  The Government entered talks with the public service unions some weeks ago to see if we could reach agreement on the composition of the necessary reduction in the payroll costs.  We have been completely up-front about the challenges faced in the public finances and the need for a substantial cut in the pay bill in 2010.We believe that an agreed approach is the best way.  The Government wants to avoid escalating industrial action which could damage us at home and abroad, but the public service unions have to understand that the Government needs to take this action now.It is worthwhile repeating why we need to reduce the pay bill.  This year, the State will borrow an estimated €22 billion to fill the gap between revenues and spending on services.  That is €420 million each week.  More than one of every four euro of current day-to-day spending is borrowed money.  This is not reasonable, it is not sensible and it is not sustainable.Tax revenues in the region of €32 billion are anticipated this year, which is back to 2003 levels, while current spending is at around €56 billion in 2009.  The total pay bill has tracked the increase in spending, going from just under €13 billion in 2003 to almost €20 billion this year.All sides of this House accept the need for a €4 billion adjustment in our public finances.  One third of day-to-day voted expenditure is spent on public sector pay and 38% is spent on social welfare.  Anyone who thinks we can make this level of adjustment without looking at these two areas of expenditure is frankly deluded.Measures have been taken in the past year in a effort to reduce public service payroll costs.  The general round pay increases under the terms of the review and transitional agreement due in 2009 were not paid.  A general moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service has been applied.  Incentivised early retirement and career break schemes were introduced for most of the public service.  Most significantly, a pension related deduction of an average of 7% was applied to all the earnings of all public servants.I recognise that through these measures public servants have already made a significant contribution and that the take home pay of public servants has been reduced by the pension levy and by the tax measures which applied across the economy.  I can indeed understand that these measures have caused unhappiness among public servants.  However, it is important to remind ourselves that public servants enjoy job security and a guaranteed pension that is unique in the workforce at present.  In that regard, their experience during this recession has been far more benign than that of many in the private sector.  Over a quarter of a million people are unemployed in this economy.  Tens of thousands of those who have managed to keep their jobs have been forced to accept a shorter working week.  The value of private pensions has plummeted.I do not seek to set the plight of the private sector against that of the public sector.  The fact is both sectors are interdependent and the burden of adjustment must be shared between them.  The measures already taken and further reductions now required in the public service pay bill do not arise from any lack of respect or appreciation by the Government of the quality and commitment of public servants.  They are a matter of budgetary necessity in the unprecedented difficulties which we face.The Government indicated to the public service unions that around €1.3 billion of the €4 billion adjustment should come from the public service pay bill in 2010.  That is a 6.6% decrease in the total public service pay and pensions bill, the same percentage by which prices have fallen in the past year in Ireland.  In addition, the Government has invited the unions to consider agreeing with them a new and challenging programme for transforming the public service.  There is nothing new to the public service in change but there is now a new and most pressing imperative.  We can no longer afford the existing cost of our public service.  The public service pay bill must be reduced not just in the interests of our public finances, but also as a means of restoring our competitiveness.  The cost of providing public services is a key determinant of our competitiveness.  Like most other costs in our economy, the cost of public services grew to unsustainable levels during the boom years.  If we want to restore economic growth and create jobs, we must reduce these costs.For the first time since the Second World War, average consumer prices are falling in this country.  Consumer prices in October were down 6.6% from the same month last year.  Food prices are down 6%, clothing is 13% cheaper, while rents are down as much as 16%.  Analysis by my Department suggests that the cost of living has fallen over the past 12 months by around 7.5% for working households, a category which includes all public sector workers.  As prices fall, the real spending power of income earners rises.  In the past 20 years, salaries in the public service have increased substantially ahead of inflation.  Given the perilous state of the public finances and the fact that falling prices have boosted workers' real spending power, it is not unreasonable to seek a reduction in salaries.Above and beyond the need to cut the cost of public service pay, we need now urgently to reform the way in which we deliver services to our citizens so that we can get better value from scarcer resources.  The Government's vision for the public service is of an increasingly integrated service — more focused on the needs of the citizen, more responsive and more cost effective.  We all want a high performance, high productivity service where the performance of organisations and individuals is better managed and where there is greater accountability.  We want a service that works more closely across sectoral, organisational and professional boundaries when designing and delivering services.We want a single flexible labour market and talent pool with a facility to redeploy staff across sectoral boundaries.  We need this level of flexibility for the future regardless of our economic circumstances.  However, the need for greater mobility and flexibility has become all the more pressing because of the urgency of achieving economies and reductions in overall public service numbers.  We simply must be able to move staff from activities which are of lesser priority or which have been restructured to areas of greater need.  We must achieve a permanent reduction in the size of our public service to obtain a permanent reduction in its cost.The Government wants to change the way in which the public service does its business.  We want "back of house" operations delivered efficiently.  There is no reason every single public body must have its own unit issuing pay cheques or tenders.  Shared services can ensure that economies of scale are captured and best and innovative practice deployed across large numbers of organisations.  Where it makes economic sense and the same or better quality standards can be achieved, they should be delivered by the private sector.We want to change the way in which the public service interacts with its customers, with greater delivery of services on-line and local offices restructured or reconfigured.  In other cases national services will be realigned to county boundaries.  In addition to the rationalisation of State agencies the Government announced last year, the Government is taking decisions on the recommendations of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes to drive a further rationalisation of State bodies.  Whatever number of State agencies we end up retaining, there is a need for improved governance arrangements.The Government knows that this transformation to the smaller, leaner, integrated and technologically aware public service can be best achieved against a background of co-operation and industrial peace.  Ultimately, the only way to achieve real change is through engagement on the issues.  That is why this day of action and the further days of industrial action threatened by the public service unions do not help us to achieve a successful outcome to the discussions on the reduction to the pay bill.  I call on the public service unions to return to the talks tomorrow with a commitment and readiness to reach an agreement in the country's best interest.No one in the public service wants to lose the best of public service ethos and practice, the ethical conduct, the fairness and equality of application and readiness to respond to whatever challenges they are faced with.  That has been shown in abundance in the past few days all over the country.  As the Government finalises the budget and examines reductions in all areas of expenditure, including social welfare, I am disappointed that a protected group in our economy should withdraw their labour for a day as the country battles to regain economic stability.  The burden of adjustment must be shared by all of those who can afford it.  All of us in positions of leadership, including trade union leaders, have a duty to lay aside the rituals of our roles and think and act in the best interests of our citizens.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20708	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The anger and frustration of people in the public service is very understandable today.  This is the second time in a year that people are being asked to take a substantial cut in their pay.  There is a sense, too, that those who have been at the core of creating this crisis in our country have not been brought to book in the regulatory, banking or political systems.  This builds frustration and anger and beyond that, there is no strategy coming from government as to how pain offered up now can resolve the problems of this economy.One will search in vain for any sign of new vision coming from the Minister, including in his comments today.  He stated that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was not forced into this.  None of us will know if this is the case because we have not been sitting around the table to hear the tone and approach taken in the talks.  Many people believe that issues congress sought to put on the table, namely, to have a substantial employment dimension to the budget and show a willingness to address the collapse for some workers of pension entitlements, have been rebuffed.There is no willingness on the part of Government to look beyond the agenda of cutting to see how we can create a fair social contract for the future.  Fairness is a vital ingredient.  I agree, as I have signalled already to the Minister, that we must find €1.3 billion in cuts to the public service pay bill.  I also believe — I did not hear it from the Minister in his response — that there needs to be a dividend for those who make such a sacrifice, as certain benchmarks are achieved, for example, benchmarks on the reform of the public service, and the correction of the public finances.  Then there would be some sense of fairness and balance.  There needs to be a commitment that sacrifices would be proportionate to one's ability to pay.  We have not heard from the Minister about his thinking on how sacrifice should be contributed.  If those who are in the most difficult circumstances on the lowest pay felt that was the case, there might be a broader support for the Minister's approach.There needs also to come from Government a broad-based approach to tackling competitiveness.  It is an illusion to think that competitiveness is just about pay.  It is also about rents that are only upwardly mobile, rents that are excessive, boardroom pay that is excessive, excessive utility prices that are controlled by Ministers, excessive rate bills and excessive compliance costs.  If that was part of a genuine commitment by Government to tackle the competitiveness agenda on a broad base, there would be more belief among workers that while they are being asked to make a sacrifice, a commensurate sacrifice is being asked and demanded in other areas.The National Competitiveness Council produced figures that show we have some of the highest costs for professional services, including legal and accountancy services, compared to our competitors.  Those issues have to be addressed on a par.  There is no sense that the Government has an action plan to address those issues either legislatively or by any other method.  Balance must be brought into the equation.  Most importantly, we need a strategy to convince people that we will not be back in the same position next year, looking for €4 billion from the same source, seeking to make cuts in the social welfare budget and the public service pay bill, and that we will not have moved on.  That is at the core of the difference between those in Government and those on the Opposition benches who believe that the financial problems are real and that while they are a constraint on devising a strategy, we must now do so to tackle the employment crisis.  That is the big difference.  If the Minister wants a key to get people from the trade union movement and the wider community on board, we have to put that goal up in lights, that this is about making room for initiatives that will tackle employment.We have our backs to the wall.  Regardless of whether we like it, 20% has been taken out of our economy.  If those of us who are strong enough to resist change do so, then those who are weakest will take all the slack.  It will be those people who lose their jobs, who are faced with unemployment or emigration and who will take the burden of this recession.  As a community we cannot afford that.  It is not a question of the Minister calling for talks; it has already been signalled by the trade union movement that it is willing to enter talks.  It is vital that the talks are on a broad agenda.  I accept that the issue of public service pay must be confronted, but the talks must also focus on a broader agenda of the sort of country we should be trying to create out of the ashes of this disaster.Let us not pretend that the problems in the public service have not been actively created by Government itself.  That is the reality.  There has been a huge void at the heart of the State in the way it has approached the public service in recent years.  Decentralisation was a cynical move that was not about delivering professional standards or high performance in the public service, but all about pandering to short-term political needs.  It was soft-option politics.  Benchmarking was another such example of where Ministers have led the public service into the very crisis we now face.  One cannot blame trade unions for accepting benchmarking awards that were dished out without demanding performance in return.  The responsibility for demanding performance in return lay with Government.  Decision after decision taken by Government has underlined that the Government does not care about professional standards in the public service.  We need only look at the way the Health Service Executive and decentralisation were handled.  Some of the things that damaged the public service include the refusal to have proper performance measures for people who manage our public services and for people who announce strategies.  Those problems have been created not by the trade unions but by the Government.I do not exonerate the trade unions either.  There has been willingness within the social partnership in recent years by the unions to see their role as to resist reform rather than to promote it but, ultimately, responsibility for driving social partnership to achieve new visions lies with Government.  In recent years, the Government has not put an ambitious programme of reform on the agenda for the social partners.  It has been part of the cosy circle, the soft approach to regulation and rip off that was spawned in recent years by a social partnership that was too dominated by producer interests.  We, but in particular the Government, created that tendency to pretend that all social partnership was about was protecting producer interests.  That has done huge damage to us.At this time of crisis we must rekindle social partnership to address a huge challenge, one of unprecedented proportions.  This is an opportunity for social partnership to prove its worth.  We have not had a challenge to social partnership since the 1980s that makes it worth our while to find an agreement, one that is about more than just solving the Government's problem of the next three weeks.  That is what has been missing in this debate, from what I can gather from the exchanges between the trade union movement and the Government.  The debate has been predominantly about how the Government is going to solve its problem for the next three weeks.  We need to look well beyond that.  We need to have a genuine programme of public service reform.I have heard the Minister and his two predecessors speak about public service reform, but nothing happened.  The Minister is repeating what many have said, that we do not need repetitive services in every agency across the board.  They can be shared and delivered more cost effectively, but where is the tool that has been put in place to deliver that?  Who is driving that agenda?  Last week, we learned from the McCarthy group that no one is driving that agenda.  The only chance that it might happen is if the Department of Finance squeezes the budget and then maybe the idea will crop up.We need someone to drive a vision for the public service.  At the core of that vision we must have a system where people bid for their money, where managers are held accountable for results, on which they should report, and that they are given the tools to manage.  I call it the BART system.  It is a smart way in that one bids, one is accountable, one reports and one has the tools to deliver.  That has not been introduced to the public service.  Until the Government commits to that, we will retain talented people trapped in a public service system that is failing them.I do not see any radical change of direction evident in the Minister's statement.  There has to be a radical change of direction and that starts with the way budgets are put together.  Amazingly, Minister for Finance after Minister for Finance has refused to reform that and it is the single greatest blunder made by the Government throughout its period of office.  One has to change that if one is to genuinely start a new approach.This is a time when we need a shared vision, one of a more authentic Ireland than the one created by the Celtic tiger years, one that is really tackling pension equity, for example, which is on the trade union agenda, job creation, which is also on the trade union agenda, and a fair health service, not a two-tier health service.  Those are things we need to set as our ambitions and then one can start to bring people along.  We need a sense of direction in which we are being led.  Social partnership will be at its best when there is a clear vision that we are all addressing.  However, the Government has not created that sense of vision.  That is the big void that remains.  Until the Government creates that sense of vision, we will continue to run into problems of misunderstanding, anger and frustration whereby some people feel they are being asked to carry the entire burden.  That cannot be allowed.  The forthcoming budget must set out a sharing of the burden.  We must ask those at the top of the scale who have been able to shelter their income to pay more.  We must have fairness in how we address so many elements of our code.  Then we can start to bring people with us.  At the core we must have a vision for creating employment.If we in this time of crisis condemn another generation to emigration and unemployment, as occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, political leadership will have failed dismally.  This is a vital period.  I agree with the Minister that we do not want an escalation of the dispute, nor do we want to pitch the private sector against the public sector.  However, we need to lay the groundwork for reform to which all people feel they can contribute.  To date, however, the Government has not done so.This strike may achieve nothing but it may make those of us in the political arena think more constructively about how we can create an agenda that will command the loyalty and support of all.  This is so important at this time.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I wish to share time with Deputy Gilmore.Ireland is at its best when its people come together as a community and society.  The response to the disastrous floods is a reminder of the community spirit, meitheal and can-do approach that serves our country best.  Firemen, soldiers, the voluntary sector, Red Cross, Civil Defence and private sector are all working together to serve the country.Having listened this morning to the denigration of public service staff on the radio, it seemed to me that there are those who, rather intemperately, seek to promote a propaganda and hate war to divide the public and private sectors.  Fianna Fáil, including its Ministers and backbenchers, should be careful about those who cry "war, war" rather than "jaw-jaw".  I lived in Africa when the radio was used to drive societies apart.  It is a cumulative phenomenon whereby, in the end, the other becomes the enemy and respect is destroyed.I noted in the media today a reference to a conference that the Minister attended at which Mr. David Went, a prominent banker and businessman and chairman of the industry consultation panel of the Financial Services Regulator, was quoted as having said parliamentary oversight of bankers was more of a lynch mob process than anything else.  He was very critical on certain points, including on bankers being asked questions in Parliament about why they had destroyed a large part of the economy and the banking system.  In the same statement and in other speeches, Mr. Went called for massive increases in salaries for those at the top level of the financial services industry.  He openly commended a reported increase of approximately €140,000 for the new regulator to be appointed in January.As with Mr. Michael McDowell and Ms Margaret Thatcher, it has become fashionable for some of our economists to say fairness has nothing to do with the solution to our economic programmes.  Philosophically, that is a profoundly incorrect approach.In Ireland, citizens have a right to ask questions and have parliamentarians ask questions about what has led to our economic collapse.  It is not just Fianna Fáil, malpractice, misgovernance and the lack of governance that have brought us to where we are, although they have undoubtedly contributed.  Ireland is a mixed economy and needs a strong public sector in addition to a strong private sector.  We do not need an economic model based on an extreme finance capital market model, which seems to be what many commentators are suggesting.Ministers in office for 12 years have, in many cases, become rather contemptuous in casual private conversation of public servants.  They fail to see their own failings, particularly their disastrous partisan decisions, such as Mr. Charlie McCreevy's decision on decentralisation, which has not only demoralised large parts of the public service, but has also caused some chaos.  What can we demand of public servants?  All younger public servants have no difficulty living in a world where work is done between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. without special extra payments.  Modern communications, IT and the availability of transport mean the public service model that still applies in the minds of some is irrelevant to most young, qualified graduates.  If the Ministers explore productivity in these areas, they will find common ground.Bearing in mind the various difficulties that arose since we became independent, the reason we developed public sector companies was because the private sector was not willing to invest.  Even in today's market, private sector businesses in Ireland, unlike those in countries such as Italy, frequently sell out as soon as they experience any kind of capital growth, either to other entrepreneurs or, as is more usual, international investors.  People on the conservative side in the 1930s believed the development of an electricity network by the ESB would ruin the country.  The Minister must try to combine imaginatively the best of the public service and the best of the private sector.  Unless we manage to do so, we will not achieve the job creation we need to get this country moving again.  Instead, we will face a resumption of emigration and, in the word's of the Minister's father, we will send abroad people who are finely educated, but that will be their fate.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	291	This week, we have seen the worst of weather and the best of people, the worst of the elements and the best of human nature.  Faced with the worst floods anyone can remember, we have seen neighbours helping neighbours, communities working together and voluntary organisations helping out.  As a country, we are at our best when we work together to deal with our problems.  At the centre of these efforts have been public servants.  I refer to fire crews, ambulance crews, the Army, local authority workers, the Garda and even the Naval Service.  They have been working through all hours and in terrible conditions to deal with a national emergency.What a striking contrast to the picture of public servants that has been systematically and unfairly painted for the past 12 months and more.  It seems impossible to reconcile the caricature that has been drawn of 300,000 time-serving bureaucrats with the reality that has been seen on our streets and shown on our screens for the past week.  Yet today, outside the areas directly affected, these same public servants are on strike, in dispute with a Government that has sought conflict rather than agreement.Today's strike could and should have been averted.  The staff of the State who are on strike today are on strike because of the unfair way in which they have been treated by the Fianna Fáil Government, because they are sick and tired of being belittled by the scapegoaters and because Fianna Fáil has cynically failed to negotiate a way of avoiding the strike.For the past month, I have been putting to the Taoiseach the idea that there should be a national agreement for recovery with five elements: a coherent jobs strategy; a home guarantee; a fair budget; a negotiated agreement to secure savings in the public sector wage bill; and, in return for the latter, industrial peace.  An agreement constructed on the basis of these five points would not only deliver the savings that are needed, but send a clear signal the world that Ireland is united in its determination to deal with its problems in a serious way.No effort was made by Fianna Fáil to respond to those proposals.  All last week, the Government sat on its hands as the strike approached and made no attempt to avoid it.  It was as if the Government wanted the strike to take place, to save the day's pay and to allow it to blow over before resuming negotiations.  Nothing could be more cynical.That cynicism compounds the sense of unfairness.  This is the third time in a year that Fianna Fáil has reduced the pay of State employees.  The so-called pension levy, the income levies in the April budget and now again.  Three successive cuts and still nobody has been called to book for the disaster in the banks and no Minister has resigned over economic mismanagement and waste.On top of that, Fianna Fáil has colluded in the belittling of public servants.  For months, there has been a sustained campaign of ballyragging, abuse and denigration targeted at the public sector.  It is as if it were somehow the nurse in the accident and emergency department who caused the Exchequer deficit or the rank and file gardaí who caused the problems in the banks.The Fianna Fáil Government allowed and encouraged this campaign and failed in its duty to defend the State's employees against unfair attack.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	294	In our system, senior public servants are prevented from becoming involved in public or political controversy.  That is as it should be.  However, that means that when some area of the public service comes in for unfair or inaccurate attack, it falls to the political masters, the Government of the day, to publicly explain and clarify what public servants do.  Governments of all hues have taken this responsibility seriously, until now.  The cowardly and opportunistic attitude by the Fianna Fáil Government is another reason that the staff are outside the gates.Where has this campaign of abuse got us?  Nowhere.  We have a public service that is angry and fed up beyond belief.  We have a national public sector strike but are no closer to dealing with the problems that Fianna Fáil and the bankers created.Many of those commentators who have led the charge against the public service are the same commentators who have always denigrated everything public.  Theirs is the ideology of deregulation which got us into this mess in the first place.  Their facile idea of how to deal with this crisis is to call for tougher action.To turn one section of society against another and to sell the myth that by targeting one group in our society the rest of us can somehow avoid bearing any of the burden of dealing with this crisis, does not add up.  The crisis is too great for that.  The mess that Fianna Fáil has created this time is just so large there is no way to shift it off on to someone else.  If one tries to do so, one will simply create division and conflict, make the problem worse and store up trouble for the future.Neither can we pretend that only those who caused the problem will have to pay for the problem.  Unfortunately, that will not work either.  The only way to deal with the financial deluge is the same way people are dealing with the other deluge — by pulling together.This is a small country, with big problems.  History tells us if we pull together we can overcome our difficulties with far less difficulty than if we pull ourselves apart.  That is the real lesson of the 1980s.  It is not of a tough Minister for Finance ready to inflict pain wherever he found it but of a negotiated settlement and an agreed way forward.We need determined leadership from the Government.  There is, however, more to leadership than a willingness to hand out pain to those who can least afford to take it.  The system of social partnership set up in the late 1980s has had many critics.  I accept there are good grounds for some of that criticism.  If we turn our backs on the partnership approach, however, then it may take a long time indeed to restore it.  That will be costly.  People sent away from the bargaining table in bad times or brought to it for no real negotiations will not feel inclined to return to it in good times when their bargaining position is stronger.Social partnership has to change but it is dangerous to demolish it when there are few alternatives.  Those who hanker after conflict have little knowledge of the past and no sense of the future.  They will take us nowhere.  The way forward is through national unity and social solidarity.In the past few months, I have addressed several trade union conferences where I have made it clear that I see no value in industrial action.  I have argued the public sector pay bill will have to come down.  I accept there is an urgent requirement for reform in the public service with old rigidities about deployment and recruitment coming to an end.  It is my experience that message has been understood.Unfortunately, the Government has not taken up that opportunity and appears determined to plough ahead to cut pay and go its own way.  It has refused to engage in negotiations to achieve a package to reduce the public service pay bill through reform rather than unilateral action.  Such an approach would have avoided the kind of industrial action we have seen today.  It was cynical on the Government's part to allow this dispute to take place, particularly when we are now told arrangements have been made to reconvene talks tomorrow.

However, they want to see the people at the top of the public service taking the largest share of the burden.

Deputy Burton is well aware that is often the case when Ministers address conferences.  While I do not know the context in which Mr. David Went made his comments, for my part I want to make it clear there must be a proportionate contribution.We must also remember the proportionate contribution made to date through adjustments in the tax burden.  There has been a highly proportionate contribution made through the income levy, to which Deputy Gilmore referred.  The fact is that those who earn most are paying by far the most in the income levy.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Tax is one of the major methods of effecting redistribution in any economy.  Almost half of earners are not in the income tax net at all.  The numbers in the top rate have fallen from 20% to 12%.  The numbers at the standard rate are the same.  That illustrates a massive reduction of incomes across every sector of society.  Tax receipts are coming disproportionately from the higher end.I agree with Deputy Burton on higher public sector pay.  I have received the review body's report which I will consider.  It will be submitted to the Government for consideration and the Government will take a decision on publication of the report.  Clearly, the report recommends substantial decreases in the payments for top level public servants.  The numbers covered directly by the review groups come to about 4,000, if one includes medical consultants who are not the subject of a recommendation by the review body as part of the last general review in 2007, since there were contracts negotiations under way with the consultants at the time.The numbers covered by the review group are in excess of 1% of the total numbers in the public service.  Having said that, it is important that they give an example.  I examined a report published by The Sunday Tribune last week which listed high earners in both the private and public sector and it is fair to say that Ministers did not emerge as the most highly paid of the leadership element of the public service.  Even with the inclusion of medical consultants, the pay of the groups covered by the review group would represent about 4% of the total public service pay bill.I note Deputy Burton's request to have the report published in advance of the budget.  I will certainly draw that request to the attention of my colleagues when they consider this report, which will occur before any budget day announcement.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20708	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	307	In his speech, the Minister gave the impression that his discussions with the trade unions have been confined to the issue of public service pay.  That certainly seems very surprising.  What does the Minister believe is necessary to address the employment crisis in this country?  Fine Gael has put forward our proposals which include cutting the cost of employers' PRSI and setting up a holding company that could leverage private investment into our public utilities.  These initiatives would make a difference.  Does the Minister support those, or has he alternative initiatives for employment that would broaden the base of this budgetary debate?When Mr. McCarthy started to file reports for the different Departments, a core issue related to moving staff from an area of low priority to an area of high priority.  Is the Minister telling us that he has had no initiative on this until days before the budget?  Is that the state of preparedness in the Department of Finance for restructuring the public service?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The discussion have not been confined to public service pay.  If I inadvertently gave that impression, it was certainly not my intention.  I tried to convey in my speech the urgency of addressing the need for an effective saving in public sector pay in order to prepare for the Estimates next year.  The discussions are not confined to public sector pay.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, myself and other Ministers have engaged with all of the social partners such as business, agriculture, the social pillar and the trade union movement.  The discussions have covered both public service pay and the transformation agenda, but they have also examined the wider budgetary and economic questions to which Deputy Bruton referred.  We have specifically examined questions which he raised in the course of his contribution, such as how to support jobs, different sectors of the economy and so on.  The whole question of fairness as raised by Deputy Burton is also being examined.  All these issues have been raised under the social partnership discussions.The Government hosts social partnership discussions, but the Government is also an employer.  The Deputy asked whether the issue of redeployment has been raised in the past few weeks.  This issue has been raised by the Government since the inception of the moratorium.  The moratorium is a crude instrument.  For the moratorium to be effective, redeployment is required.  However, redeployment in the absence of agreement will prompt industrial action which the House is discussing today.  I am not sure if Deputy Bruton is suggesting that we should have imposed redeployment and provoked earlier industrial action, or whether we should have done what are doing, which is to engage with the different bodies that represent public service workers on how we can have an effective scheme of redeployment which will minimise the disruption caused by the moratorium and allow us to focus staff in the most important areas that require priority.The Government has maintained a substantial capital programme throughout this particular recession.  As a proportion of GDP, it is one of the largest programmes in any EU member state.  We must also add the cost of public private partnership programmes to that, which will ultimately be borne by the taxpayer through a different financial mechanism.  There is a substantial volume of public investment in this economy.  Deputy Bruton is proposing the substantial disposal of a large number of assets that are owned by the State and the reinvestment from the proceeds of those assets in other lines of investment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20708	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	309	It is a bit more sophisticated than that.

The question arises in the current market conditions as to whether the taxpayer would get a decent return on the disposal of these assets.  Having disposed of the assets, the Deputy is proposing that they be put into some form of public investment vehicle, which will then invest the proceeds in other forms of investment, such as broadband.  The Deputy is proposing a great work of financial engineering, but I do not see how these assets will be realised within a realistic timeframe for a realistic price, generating an immediate investment in the economy of the type he wishes to see emerge.  I will examine his proposals again if, as he says, he has refined them since earlier in the year.The issue of PRSI is a budgetary matter.  It must be noted that PRSI in Ireland is lower than most other European countries——

These people also wanted privatisation of our public sector.  These people were very opposed to the public realm and to the public sector.  Unfortunately, those voices are still dominant.  I noticed that in yesterday's edition of The Irish Times, Mr. Donal Casey claimed that there was more individualism in Irish society due to social partnership, which I find to be absurd.We need a more controlled market and better, stronger and a more valued public realm.  In that regard, does the Minister agree it is wrong to single out public sector workers for the blame and burden of what happens now in terms of solving our economic crisis?  Does he agree we need a strong and valued public sector rather than a weakened, demoralised and decimated public sector?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	317	There are many big questions there.  First, I believe we should have a strong, vibrant and proud public sector.  As Minister responsible for the public sector, I am very concerned at the demoralisation that has taken place.  However, no sector can be immune from criticism and no sector that is paid for by the taxpayer can be immune from cost control.  These are fundamental matters for any Government.The public sector we all want to see in Ireland and the vision I would subscribe to is a public sector that is highly motivated and, as Deputy Gilmore said earlier, showing the virtues and attributes which its members have shown in the areas affected by the floods, which have been very remarkable virtues showing a huge sense of commitment.  By and large, that exists within the public sector.  However, when we are talking about pay and pay rates, we have to ground ourselves in realities about the public sector.  All of the objective studies that have examined this question have shown that the average rates of pay in the public sector, occupation by occupation, are often way above either international comparisons or valid local existing comparisons.It is true that there is no comparison, for example, in the case of a Garda, a nurse or a teacher because, generally, these are public service occupations.  However, when one makes comparisons with other countries, it is clear they are well paid by international standards.  We do not debate this often in this House.  Some work was done by the ESRI on this and I regret the fact that this ESRI coverage did not seem to factor into the equation the pension levy, and the extent to which this had already effected a reduction, because the 20% referred to by the ESRI as the average disparity had immediately to take a 7% deduction.  That is important and worth noting.  The public sector has made a big contribution towards resolving our financial crisis.  I do not think the argument about pensions can be made as strongly in regard to public servants any more because, increasingly, the proceeds of the levy will provide for the cost of the pensions.  This is an example of where the Government has engaged in what is a public sector reform, although not a popular one, I accept.With regard to the Deputy's wider questions about the causes of the current crisis being the existence of a free market and the lack of regulation, they are two distinct issues.  Most individuals nowadays subscribe to the view that market disciplines and performance indicators are very important in measuring the value of any service that is delivered, whether it is in a competitive market or a sheltered market that is free from competition, and there are sheltered markets in both the public and private sectors and there are of course competitive markets in both the public and private sectors.  I am not sure the question of the free market bears on this.I would agree with the Deputy that lack of regulation in banking was a major problem.  She makes a fair point in regard to lack of regulation in banking, which was part of a worldwide trend as the banking crisis here is not unique.  What is unique about it is the form it took, namely, a rather old-fashioned banking crisis involving excessive lending to property developers.  In many countries, the financial crisis took the form of highly sophisticated financial instruments whose face value bore no relationship to their actual value.  When market confidence collapsed in these instruments, banking systems and economies collapsed with them.I do not want to return to the NAMA debate which took place at length in this House.  I want to take up the question the Deputy raised about tax rates, including low tax rates, which the Deputy maintained were part of the problem that generated our economic crisis.  If one analyses these low tax rates, the incontestable fact is that they have benefited the lowest paid the most.  If one has an income tax system where half the earners are paying no income tax, one clearly has a tax system which incentivises work.  In ways, that is a very good state of affairs.  Of course, one has to balance that with the need for social solidarity and for every citizen to realise that he or she pays a contribution towards the services which he or she receives.  That is a balance we will have an opportunity to argue about in the budget.

I want to ask him what he is going to do to stop the industrial action next week.  He has not said anything in his formal script or since that tangibly will have any impact on what is happening outside the gate.  The people outside the gate know that Fianna Fáil has brought this country to the edge of ruin.  They know that when the economy crashed, the Taoiseach was driving the car.  I want the Minister to acknowledge there is a lot of ballyhoo surrounding the budget about secrecy and so on.  If the Minister was to announce here this evening that, in the matter of basic pay, he does not intend to impact further on public servants of modest incomes, I believe it would do wonders to avert the industrial action now scheduled for next Thursday.  Can the Minister say in the House now that people on modest incomes will be protected from further attack on basic pay in order to avert industrial action planned for next Thursday?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13502	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The Minister states that the €1.3 billion reduction — he calls it an adjustment — envisaged will be offset by the 6.6% decrease by which prices have fallen.  The import of this is that a reduction of €1.3 billion in the public sector pay bill has no effect in real terms because prices have been reduced effectively by the same amount.  If one takes the 6.6% and the 7% levy, that is over 13%, and if one takes the potential for an increase in interest rates which is inevitable against a backdrop where there are no adequate supports for those people who will inevitably fall into arrears on their mortgages, then the Minister is creating a major problem for those people who are on middle to low incomes.  I ask the Minister to address the question of the inevitable rise in interest rates in real terms and the effect that will have for those people who will be affected as a result of such an increase.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	320	There are two points.  First, in response to Deputy Rabbitte, discussions are taking place with the organisations that represent public service workers.  Clearly, we will continue to engage with them.  The Taoiseach urged them not to engage in today's industrial action.  I do not believe the public are impressed by today's industrial action.  While I agree that there has been an amount of irresponsible media coverage about the public service, there has also been, I think, an amount of public anger at what is taking place, and this is reflected in media coverage.  This type of action affects workers who are going about their daily business and doing their jobs, and individuals who have important transactions to perform with public servants, and it also affects the capacity to attract jobs to Ireland.  It has not been possible today, for example, for some senior officers to meet people who are investing in Ireland, which is a serious matter.This is why a group in negotiation with the Government should be reluctant to engage in such an action.  I appreciate ballots were held and democratic decisions taken that must be implemented by the representative organisations.  As I understand the position, there is no irrevocable commitment to further industrial action.  I hope this position is reflected upon.Regarding Deputy Sherlock's question on the distribution of public service pay in the context of interest rate rises, approximately two thirds of public servants have salaries of €50,000 or less, accounting for approximately 50% of the public service pay bill.  If significant savings are to be achieved through reductions in the pay bill, this group cannot be excluded totally.  Approximately 15% of public servants have salaries in excess of €60,000, accounting for 29% of the pay bill.  Some 10% of public servants have salaries of more than €70,000, accounting for a little over 20% of the pay bill.  Only 3% or so of public servants have salaries in excess of €100,000, accounting for approximately 9% of the pay bill.  In any discussions with the relevant organisations and in any Government decisions taken with, I hope, the representative bodies or in the national interest, there must be some tiering of the degree of reduction that applies to different sectors.Deputy Sherlock raised the question of the decline in the cost of living and the impact of interest rates.  The latter have had some effect, but they are not the whole effect.  I have often heard Deputy Burton speak in the House about deflation.  No one wants deflation, although we have had it this year because of the decline in economic growth, but it is possible to have economic growth while the cost of living reduces, a more benign scenario.  A part of the reduction in the cost of living in the past year has been due to the devaluation of sterling.  Products originating in the sterling zone are cheaper in Ireland.  This situation has not been caused by the Government's budgetary decisions or economic decline here.  Rather, it has been caused by economic decline in our nearest neighbour, which is worth noting.Not all of the reduction in the cost of living is accounted for by the decline in interest rates.  The examples that I gave illustrated the reduction in the cost of food, rent and clothing.  The basics have all seen substantial reductions, much of which owes to British products becoming cheaper or Irish products being made more cheaply to compete with British imports.  These have been major factors in the reduction in the cost of living.Interest rates played their part and introduced some of the variability that is evident upon examining the different deciles.  In particular, they show how the cost of living has reduced the least for those in retirement.  Interest rates are at historically low levels.  The question of an exit strategy from the monetary support adopted by the European Central Bank and other banks is under discussion in Europe, but no decisions are imminent.  Some pressures on domestic interest rates have come about due to poor funding practices in our banking sector.  For example, some institutions had an excessive number of tracker mortgages.  The effect of the European interest rate decrease has been to make those mortgages uneconomical for the institutions concerned.  The overall trend in interest rates is not as apocalyptic as Deputy Sherlock suggests.  We are not looking at any immediate increase.

#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Last April, there was much hullabaloo when it became clear that we had a large deficit.  In such situations, corrections must be made.  It cannot be ignored that €5.3 billion in potential savings have been identified by the McCarthy report.  According to the Minister, the statement by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that the Government has forced it to take this strike action is not correct.  My understanding is that one of ICTU's principle concerns is the pace at which the Minister is going about the adjustments.  This matter is at the centre of today's strikes.Last April, when it became clear that corrections would need to be made, the target was to reduce a 10% deficit of GDP to 3% by 2013.  At the time, there was a concern that if we did not make great efforts to do so, financial markets would take fright and interest rates would become high.  Some suggested that we would not be able to borrow money.Since then, the situation seems to have changed.  The numbers were wrong in the first place and the deficit has turned out to be greater than was believed in April.  As a result, the 2013 date has been allowed to slip, but not by the Minister originally.  The European Commission has given us until 2014 to reduce the deficit from 12% to 3%.  From next January, this will be the same time span that the Minister would have had between last April and 2013, yet the reduction is greater.  It would not have been possible to reduce it from 10% to 3% in the time given.  In my opinion and that of many others, it is not possible to reduce it to 3% by 2014, even given the pace of these significant adjustments.I am not saying that adjustments should not be made, but the pace is the cornerstone of the debate.  When it was announced that we would allow the pace to change, there was no difficulty in the financial markets.  Interest rates for Government bonds did not increase and people did not tell us that they would not lend to the Government.  The situation was not as calamitous as it was made out to be in the first instance.  Is it not disingenuous to suggest that the unions have forced the Government to take this action if the adjustments' pace is at the core of the argument?The Minister stated that we will have a permanently smaller public service.  I can understand why the Minister did this, as he wants to reduce the overall costs.  However, it is a negative way of viewing the issue.  It is possible to grow the public sector and sell its services in other countries.  For example, the ESB sells some of its services abroad.  Viewing the matter more creatively is possible.  For a number of years, public service employment was the particular engine of growth for female employment.  The engine of growth for male employment, construction, has been broken and thrown into reverse.

He will also put it into reverse.  The two engines of employment growth will be in reverse at a time when we are trying to get out of a problem.  Is there a level of unemployment and emigration at which the Minister might say enough is enough or maybe the unions have a point about the pace being too difficult for a small open economy?Dr. Colm McCarthy, the economic consultant on whose advice the Minister is basing much of his approach to cuts, attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week.

He said "No", as ESRI studies had shown that people at the lower end and in the middle of the public sector were better paid than their counterparts in the private sector.  According to him, cutting their wages by less would not address the problem.  I would be interested in learning the Minister's opinion of Mr. McCarthy's suggestion that people at the top should get the same proportional pay cut as those in the middle.

Given his economic strategy, one would be forgiven for believing that he wants deflation.  Deflating the country back to competitiveness is at the centre of his strategy.Many public servants are on strike.  I do not agree with the strike but I understand why they are doing it.  They took a 7.5% pay cut through the pension levy earlier this year.  Many feel that they did not stand up for themselves at that point and that they need to do so now.  Many of those who voted for the strike today understand there must be pay reductions in the forthcoming budget.  I understand that.  They would like an assurance that any pay cuts in the forthcoming budget will be the last set of cuts.  If the Minister makes such a statement in the next few days, it will make a difference.  He should say to the public servants that they took a big cut in April and must take another in the coming budget, but that it will the last one, that the Minister is not going to come at them again in the spring or summer.  If the Minister could do this, it would make a big difference.

Deputy Varadkar made a very constructive suggestion.  Were we to say that a combination of a pay reduction with improvements in work practices in the next year would secure the necessary savings for 2011 and bring certainty into the public service and certainty to their income, it would be of enormous assistance to the public sector.  The longer we can give citizens certainty in which they can plan their affairs for the next two years, the better.  It is a constructive suggestion.  Incidentally, it is not at 7.5% reduction, it was adjusted in the April budget and amounts to 6.9% or a 7% reduction if rounded up.  There was an alleviatory measure in the April budget for the lower paid.

The issue is not how long we spend exiting from the excessive deficit position.  It is true that we have an agreement with the Commission, which runs for five years.  It is true we are the first European country to get into serious difficulties.  Many other European countries are now surpassing us in their difficulties and because of this the Commission relaxed the period by one year.  No doubt there will be a debate next year about how long the exit strategy in fiscal terms should be for all member states.  We will participate in the debate and I have an open mind on the issue.I do not have an open mind on the fact that we must make a €4 billion adjustment this year.  I welcome the support of Fine Gael and Labour on this point.  We have escalated to a deficit of 12%.  We thought it could be stabilised at 6.5%.  This did not become apparent last April, it became apparent all through the latter half of last year.

I will conclude on my response to Deputy Lee's comments.  What we must do, as the Labour Party and Fine Gael have acknowledged, is to stabilise the figure at 12%.  That is the target of this year's budget.  We cannot allow the figure to deteriorate further.  Given the general economic signs in the economy, the growing improvement in the live register position, there is no doubt in my mind that we can stabilise this figure.  Let us do this and have a theoretical debate about the exit strategy afterwards.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	345	Today's debate is opportune and I wish for a constructive debate on this most serious issue.  The Government's primary concern is with the families and individuals who are suffering the effects of flooding of their homes and property and businesses whose viability and whose workers' livelihoods are put in jeopardy.I wish to record, and I am sure all Members of the House will agree, our appreciation for all the personnel of the various authorities and agencies, both public and voluntary, individuals and communities for their outstanding work in assisting in the rescue of people and the protection, where possible, of homes and premises from the effects of flooding.The response to the flooding has been multi-faceted and impacted on the responsibilities of a number of Departments, authorities and agencies.  We will work to move from an emergency response footing to one of recovery.  In this context, other Departments and agencies come into the picture.  Many areas of the country have been affected to a greater or lesser degree by the cumulative volume of rain that has fallen over the past four weeks.  In addition to what I saw during my visit to affected areas in Cork, Clare and Galway on Saturday, we have all seen the media reports on the widespread damage caused and the disruption to road and rail transport by these floods.Regrettably, weather conditions remain threatening, and last night we saw flooding extend to several additional communities.  It is generally accepted by all the bodies concerned that the volume of rainfall last week, coming on top of the rainfall in various river catchments over recent weeks, was unprecedented and resulted in the major flooding we saw in many parts of the country especially in Cork, Clare, Galway and in the towns of Ballinasloe, Carlow and Clonmel and other areas.I take this opportunity to outline the measures that are in place to respond to, and co-ordinate, the efforts of all involved in dealing with such serious and widespread flooding.  I witnessed these inter-agency co-ordination arrangements in action myself last Saturday in the four local authority areas I visited.  I saw the same structures in use, and the same generic mechanisms deployed to gather and share information, to identify key issues and quickly agree priorities, and to direct the staff and resources of the various agencies to the points of greatest risk.  This is as it should be — locally co-ordinated emergency management meeting the greatest needs of local communities.This flooding has been the first real test of a new inter-agency co-ordination system that my Department, working closely with the Departments of Health and Children, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, developed in 2005.  I refer to the Framework for Major Emergency Management that was created to enable the Garda Síochána, the HSE and local authorities to prepare for and make a co-ordinated response to a variety of major emergencies scenarios, including flooding.  The Government approved the new system in May 2006 and it was introduced successfully across the entire local government sector, the Garda Síochána and the HSE over the years 2006-08.The widespread and successfully co-ordinated local response we have seen did not occur by accident.  The purpose of the new framework was to put in place arrangements that enabled the three principal response agencies, the local authorities, the Garda Síochána and the HSE, to prepare for and then co-ordinate their efforts when a major emergency occurs.  The year-long process of developing the new framework in 2005 was overseen by an international expert to add assurance that what we did in Ireland was up to current international best practice.  Each of the principal response agencies now has a new format major emergency plan, based on this framework, which was formally commenced on 30 September 2008.The evidence and benefits of this inter-agency response have been clear for all to see over the past few days.  The various authorities, agencies and voluntary bodies used the preparedness steps of a carefully sequenced major emergency development programme over the two years from September 2006 to September 2008 to underpin their response to this flooding.  These steps included writing the new local major emergency plans, which include severe weather plans as a subset, the procedures to carry out their task, the fitting out of selected co-ordination facilities, mostly located in local authority headquarters and which I saw, the inter-agency training for key roles, and the exercises they ran and participated in.The flood response aspect is supported by two further specifically flood related documents which were produced as part of the major emergency development programme — A Guide to Flood Emergencies and Protocol for Multi-Agency Response to Flood Emergencies.  These documents were produced in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, drawing on lessons learned from previous flooding experience, in particular in Dublin, and they compare well to any similar literature.Part of the local authorities' severe weather emergency plan preparation includes ensuring that arrangements are in place to receive early warnings from Met Éireann.  The Met Éireann forecasting arrangements entail a single system known as public service severe weather warning and cover meteorological conditions and elements such as wind, rain, thunderstorm and coastal storm surge.  The emphasis is on warning of weather events that will cause significant disruption or constitute a significant risk for people.  Met Éireann issues a severe weather warning to local authorities where conditions are forecast in accordance with criteria set down by the authority.In general, it is possible to have a degree of forewarning where flood events are concerned.  However, while the forecasting tools available enable an assessment of the likelihood of a particular meteorological occurrence to be made, it is not always possible to predict the hydrological impacts that will result in a significant flood event.  All the experts have emphasised the cumulative effects of a succession of very wet weeks in causing these floods.My Department's further role, following on from the work we have done over the past four years in developing and strengthening our major emergency management system at local level, is to co-ordinate the national level response, where there is such serious and widespread flooding.  Deputies will be aware that I formed a new national directorate for fire and emergency management in my Department in June of this year.  The staff of the directorate, led by the designated national director, Mr. Seán Hogan, have been very active also in this case.  They have convened all the relevant Departments and agencies each day since last Friday.  This national emergency response co-ordination committee have used the new national emergency co-ordination centre, which was developed for this specific purpose.  Their work has included assembling the daily reports, identifying and addressing national level issues arising, briefing both the Taoiseach and myself and other members of the Government on a daily basis on the situation and on the response effort.It is most distressing to see the impact which these floods are having on so many people, and I recall most vividly the distress which my constituents suffered some years ago in the floods in Dublin.  The Government is not responsible for the rain that has fallen or the resulting floods, but we are responsible for the fact that our services prepared carefully, diligently and consistently and made a properly co-ordinated multi-agency response at both local and national level.  Most important of all, there has been no loss of life associated with these floods.

Both issues have arisen in some areas as a consequence of the flooding in the south and west.Cork City Council's water treatment plant at Lee Road, which supplies most of the city, was closed as a result of the flooding of the plant.  I understand that substantial additional supply to the city has been made available by Cork County Council, which has increased production at the Inniscarra and Glashaboy treatment plants to the maximum.  However, there are no facilities to pump this additional water to the reservoirs which supply the 18,000 households affected.  The city council has arranged for tankered water, stand pipes and bottled water to be delivered to the households in the city without mains supply in accordance with the drinking water incident response plan guidance.  The city council is working to replace or repair the affected pumping equipment as quickly as possible.In the Cork County Council area, the flooding has led to deterioration in raw water quality and precautionary boil notices have been put in place on four water supply schemes, namely, Inchigeela, Innishannon, Ballineen and Clondrohid.  Flood damage to part of the treatment plant in Ballinasloe, while not requiring the closure of the plant has meant that a precautionary boil notice has been put in place on this supply.  A precautionary boil notice is now in place for similar reasons on the Mount Talbot Four Roads water supply scheme in County Roscommon.  These are the main boil notice situations arising from current flooding instances.  Local authorities are required to liaise with the HSE before issuing or removing a boil water notice and they must also notify the Environmental Protection Agency of such notices.I want to discuss the new elements of the planning system.

The current flooding and other recent flooding events sharply illustrate the questionable nature of some development decisions in the past and underline the necessity for action to avoid such developments in locations in which future flooding is predictable.

These will be published shortly in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.  The guidelines are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to incorporate fully flood risk assessment and management into future regional plans, county and city development plans, local area plans and in determining future applications for planning permission in line with the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.  Pending the publication of formal guidelines, planners are advised that the draft guidelines represent current best practice, and are requested to take them into account in making decisions on relevant planning issues.As we move, hopefully, into a recovery mode, I am conscious that in addition to the trauma caused by the flooding, people also suffered financial loss arising from the damage caused to their property.  The Government will act to address the most serious problems.  We will use the necessary channels to explore the scope for assistance from the EU.  Looking at national schemes, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	368	My colleagues will outline some examples of experiences they have had in their constituencies in dealing with these matters.  This crisis began last Wednesday, when gales, torrential rain and thunderstorms caused flooding in the west, with the River Corrib and its tributaries bursting banks in several parts of Galway city and county.  Continued torrential rain throughout Thursday day and evening caused some of the worst flooding in living memory throughout the country but specifically in Cork city and county, Tipperary, Galway, Clare, Kilkenny, Carlow and Kerry.  In Carlow, it could have been avoided if the implementation of the flood relief scheme had gone ahead when it was third on the list in 1995.The flooding in Cork city, which I visited last Saturday, was made worse when the ESB released water from the Inniscarra dam on Thursday, which caused the River Lee to burst its banks.  By 11.30 p.m. the western suburbs were under several feet of water; all bridges from Inniscarra to the city were closed and extensive damage had been caused to UCC, with all lectures cancelled and valuable paintings being threatened.  During the course of my visit, I saw businesses and households still under water and quays and bridges structurally threatened.  Motor cars which had been parked in areas not normally flooded were still there.  If sufficient warning had been given, I doubt they would have been parked there.I checked the rainfall pattern to establish whether this was an 800-year event and I discovered that the cumulative rainfall to 20 November at Cork Airport station was 190 mm.  The entire rainfall for the month of October at the same station was 205 mm.  The greatest ever monthly figure recorded at that station was 790 mm in October 2006.  There is no 800-year event.  This is an event that no weather could explain.  The dam was overloaded in Inniscarra and the question must be asked as to why.An independent assessment should be carried out between the ESB and the local authorities to find out what happened.  There were no flood monitoring stations in the Lee valley.  There are no physical markers to show where the flood levels are in the Lee valley.  The people working at and in charge of the Inniscarra dam had no idea of how high the water level would rise because of the absence of these markers.  These issues must be examined and I hope we will have an opportunity to do so, perhaps through the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I would prefer to see the Minister appointing an officer to independently examine these matters rather than relying on reports from local authorities and the ESB.The situation is further complicated by media reports today that the ESB was warned in three separate reports that the two strategic reservoirs in Cork might not be able to cope with extreme water volumes.According to the media, the ESB was warned in three separate reports that the two strategic reservoirs in Cork might not be able to cope with extreme water volumes.  Media sources claim that over the past eight years the reports raised issues about water management along the Lee valley in an extreme weather event, including the capacity of the two lakes above the dam to cope with a large inflow of water.  We had a false sense of security.  Is the Government in possession of these reports and can we see copies of them?My preference is for the Minister of State to appoint an authorised officer to examine these matters on an independent basis and I will be asking the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ask those involved for an explanation.  Cork's local authorities had no stocks of water or sandbags when the flood occurred.  Culpability can be assigned in respect of these matters.In response to severe flooding in September 2006, the OPW admitted that it did not have a national co-ordination plan and that the precautions in response to flooding risks were up to individual authorities.  Since then, the Government has concentrated on developing flood risk maps for the benefit of planning authorities in response to an EU floods directive adopted in 2007.  However, it has been deficient in providing an early warning system for floods.  Damage amounting to millions of euro could have been avoided if a proper alert system had been put in place.  Businesses have lost their Christmas stock, thousands of cars are on their way to the scrap heap, sentimental valuables have been destroyed and farming communities face enormous problems in terms of feeding their stock.The Government lacks an advanced monitoring system and cannot provide flood warnings to home owners and businesses.  The Government's flood website, www.flooding.ie, states: “Checking to see if water levels in the nearby river, lake or estuary are rising or starting to flood can show if a flood might happen, but be careful not to go into the water, as it may be deeper than you think.”  We can do better than that.  The environmental agencies in England and Wales operate a warning system in areas at risk of flooding from rivers or the sea.  Staff use the latest available technology to monitor rainfall, river levels and sea conditions 24 hours a day in order to forecast the possibility of flooding.  Warnings are issued using a set of four easily recognisable codes.  Alerts are made through a variety of methods, including the agencies’ websites and the media.  They do not exclusively rely on websites.  In areas which are particularly at risk warning messages can be sent directly to people by telephone, text, e-mail or pager.  Several hundred messages can be sent simultaneously.  They aim to give two hours notice of flooding, day or night, so that people can take the necessary preventative measures.We are in a unique situation in that the volume of rainfall has surpassed by far anything experienced in the past.  Ireland would be better served by a new alert system and I hope the Government can give us a commitment in that regard.

On 31 July and 1 August 2008, Newcastle West was flooded by 6 ft. of water.  The Taoiseach did not visit and while the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, came to observe the damage, the promises he made have not yet been fulfilled.  Once the water recedes, the promises made by the Government tonight will be forgotten.  The people of Newcastle West continue to suffer the effects of last year's flooding and they must be included in any compensation scheme.  Up to 200 properties, including businesses, were damaged at a cost estimated at €40 million.  Many houses were uninsured because they were owned by elderly people or for other reasons.  The Government did not raise a finger to help these people, however.  The idea of community welfare officers is a laugh in such circumstances.  The people of Newcastle West continue to suffer.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	372	This evening's debate offers the Government an opportunity to outline the measures it will take to deal with the consequences of the disastrous floods in Cork city and other areas.  In Cork city alone, 18,000 homes are without drinking water this evening.  I ask the Government what steps are being taken to restore water supplies, particularly in light of the implications for health and hygiene, and to identify the cause of the severe flooding in the Cork region.I commend local authority employees, emergency services, Civil Defence and communities on the work they have done over the past several days.  However, I wish to speak about the systems management of the crisis.  While the management of emergency services has been effective in many regions, shortcomings can be identified in communication and information provision.  Cork City Council did not set up a freefone number until last night.  Previously, people were advised to consult the council's website or ring several different telephone numbers.  If somebody uses a pre-pay mobile telephone, he or she will quickly run out of credit while calling these numbers.  Emergency numbers should be part of the response protocol and immediately advertised over the broadcast media.  A ticker tape system on television programmes could have provided local information.During the early days of the flooding, we saw plenty of footage of flooded areas but little information about how people could seek help.  People in Cork city had to rely on a chap called P. J. Coogan to find out what was happening because the council did not establish a press unit until long after the floods had started.  Mr. Coogan provided information to the people of Cork until 10.30 p.m. on Friday night and was out again at 6 a.m. the following day.  His television colleagues, such as Paul Byrne from TV3 and Paschal Sheehy from RTE, did likewise.  However, they were not briefed on a regular basis.The Pitt review produced in the aftermath of similar flooding in Britain in 2007 stated that the floods were a wake-up call and that flood risks are here to stay.  The Minister of State referred to two documents.  There is a very simple difficulty with both of the documents.  We did not have assistance management in place but, more importantly, Cork County Council is charged with this document, along with the Department.  Given that the council is advising other agencies and those applying for planning as to how to proceed with flood risk management, it beggars belief as to how the council was itself closed because of flooding.A hotel across from Cork County Council's building, which was only renovated three or four years ago — with planning permission from the council — was flooded.  It was built on a flood plain.  If one could believe it, the hotel has an underground car park that is now an underground swimming pool because of the flood.  Questions must be asked by the Minister and his Department.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The flooding in Cork city has been the worst in living memory.  Most of us living in Blackpool would realise that approximately four or five years ago there was a significant flood.  It had exactly the same consequences, and the memory of being washed out of businesses and homes and having a contaminated water supply still resonates with people.  They rarely forget it entirely.The floods in Cork have ruined both houses and businesses, which we should remember.  There are entire streets of homes — where people are living — now looking like a scene of devastation.  Businesses throughout the city have also been devastated.  One of the most awful results was the damage to the Glucksman Gallery and its paintings.  This astonished me because it is not really in the basin of the valley and is on fairly high ground.  That indicates how high the floods were.The Kingsley Hotel had a €13 million renovation recently but has been completely destroyed, with people having to be evacuated in the middle of the night.  In the Mercy Hospital, the river knocked a wall in rather than out.  The damage occurred at 4 a.m.  I met Mr. Paddy Madden, the CEO of the Mercy Hospital, the following night and he had been up all night trying to ensure that patients and equipment were saved, which they were.  We should be eternally grateful that nobody was seriously injured or died, unlike in England.We must be very grateful for the public services which have rallied in Cork and other areas of the country, going above and beyond the call of duty.  They do not at all resemble the sort of people who are being vilified in the press as we speak.  The Army and Naval Service were out, as well as the fire service and local county council workers who were filling drums of water.  When people could not get there themselves, these public servants carried them to their cars.  It was above and beyond the call of duty.Some 18,000 households in Cork city are still without water, including mine.  People here will be grateful to know that I had a shower when I got to Dublin, which is in everyone's interest.  There are many people in Cork who do not have such a facility but those who still have running water and shower facilities are asking their neighbours to their house.  They may not know these people or even have met them but that is the type of community spirit that has always existed in Ireland.  Unfortunately, it has been lost in the past few years.We have been told by climatologists time and again that this will not be the only time this will occur and that it will become more frequent.  Once in a century flooding will now occur every five years.  What precautions are we taking and what will we do about it only very little?  We need to start putting in place the type of measures which will ensure we do not come back here next year — or in two or three years — and have to talk about this again.  Maybe we will not be so lucky next time.There are people in Cork who will suffer a horrendous night tonight.  The weather has been terrible and that only adds to the type of discomfort which people are suffering.  Their homes and businesses have been destroyed, and it has quite an impact on people when they do not have what we have come to accept as normal facilities.We must consider communications.  The only public announcements were from the local broadcasters, such as P. J. Coogan, Paul Byrne and Paschal Sheehy.  We need to take serious consideration of where communications failed.

I express my own deep sympathy to all those who have been affected by the devastating flooding of recent days.  Having visited a number of the worst-hit locations in Galway, Clare and Tipperary, I have seen at first hand some of the damage and hardship wreaked.  The emotional impact on individuals and their health can be devastating.  The flooding has impacted on homes, commercial premises and infrastructure.  It has forced people from their houses and temporarily isolated and desolated whole communities.  It will recede more quickly from some areas than others.The impact of the flooding would have been even more severe had it not been for the tremendous efforts of emergency teams, which have worked tirelessly.  Thanks to them, so far no lives have been lost.  All of us would warmly thank all those involved.  We have witnessed a co-ordinated and dedicated response from all the emergency services, including local authorities, the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, the Garda and local volunteers.  OPW engineering staff have provided technical and additional material backup.  The media have also been an invaluable source of communication.  The response has been a magnificent combined effort, and I also welcome the unions' decision to exempt from today's action those providing emergency services in the worst affected areas.  The OPW's regional offices in Limerick and Headford remained open today.Recent flooding has been caused by record bad weather.  Many areas hit have not experienced this scale of flooding in living memory.  There is a growing realisation that such severe weather events are, if anything, likely to increase in frequency and intensity in coming years.  Proper and timely warnings are vital.Flood forecasting and warnings can reduce the damage but of themselves will not prevent flooding.  By providing adequate warning of an impending flood, residents and local authorities can take action to reduce the impact, such as moving valuables, erecting protection measures, including demountables, distributing sand bags, and closing off at-risk areas to prevent vehicle damage or risk to life.The effectiveness of an early warning system depends on many factors, including the reliability of rainfall and flood forecasts, the warning time achievable, the effectiveness and reliability of warning dissemination systems to the public, the awareness and preparedness of the affected population and the preparedness of the emergency response services.  A response plan must have been previously developed, tested and rehearsed.  The OPW will shortly go to tender for consultants to carry out a strategic review to assess operational structures, costs and benefits of a national flood warning system.In late 2004, the Government decided that future flood management policy in Ireland would "minimise the national level of exposure to flood damage through the identification and management of existing, and particularly potential, flood risks in an integrated, proactive and river basin-based manner".  Since 1 January this year, the OPW has had extended to it responsibility for management of coastal erosion and coastal flood risk.As an interim measure, a flood hazard maps website, www.floodmaps.ie, was created.  This website carries valuable historical data which will be useful for planners as well as the public.  We also have another website, www.flooding.ie, which gives practical help and advice to homes and businesses that have flooded or are at risk of flooding.  It contains detailed information on how to prepare for flooding, minimise effects, and safety advice in the event of flooding.

As the Minister mentioned, we have issued a draft guidance document on planning which is almost ready.  Development on flood plains should be avoided where possible.  Undoubtedly, in some previous developments flood plains were not always recognised as such and increased urbanisation and the reduction of open ground for water absorption have added to the problems we face.  No doubt planners had to take account of other polices but the bottom line today is that development should mitigate existing risk, not add to it.A contribution, though it is not a panacea, could be made also by granting the same attention to maintaining drains and waterways as to repairing potholes.  Except where necessary to avoid pollution, we should stop tarmacking everything including yards, drives and gardens.  We should do this much more selectively.The outcomes from the flood mapping and flood risk assessment management study programmes will satisfy the requirements of the EU floods directive which will be transposed into Irish law before the end of this year.  I have given the highest priority to progressing the OPW's programme of major structural flood relief schemes to reduce the flood risk in areas that already have a long history of flooding.  There have been several successful schemes, including Kilkenny, Carrick-on-Suir, the River Tolka and a number of others.  Construction work on flood relief schemes such as Mallow North, Clonmel West and Ennis Upper are substantially complete.  I draw attention to the success of the defence scheme in Mallow on Thursday night——

It prevented a substantial flood from entering the north of the town where, on previous occasions, havoc was caused to homes and businesses.  Work has just commenced in Fermoy and work in Carlow is expected to commence in early 2010.  Further details of schemes are in my full speech.I wish to make the point that all OPW localised flood relief projects are intended to ensure that works do not cause flooding problems upstream or downstream of the location being protected.  We introduced a small flood works scheme covering both inland and coastal areas.  This has been activated and no doubt will be under great demand in the future.I reiterate my deep sympathy for people who suffered loss or hardship as a result of recent flooding.  As I had the opportunity to observe working extremely well in Clonmel last January, the community welfare officer is empowered to provide assistance to the worst affected residents with insufficient means or to whom insurance against flooding has been refused.  The Government has also announced a scheme of emergency and humanitarian assistance and farm relief measures and has made application to the EU.  I assure all citizens of the Government's continued determination to address, as an absolute priority, the threat of widespread flooding.  This will include stepping up whatever we can do in connection with fresh vulnerabilities that have emerged in recent days.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I express my deepest sympathies to the people of Cork not only for the damage done to homes, but to businesses, public buildings and utilities, and also for the emotional trauma caused to individuals and the collective community.  I wish to record my appreciation of the emergency services, the Garda, the Army, Civil Defence, community groups, fire brigades and public officials who implemented the emergency plan.  They gave substantial time and made themselves available despite the public service dispute.  A strong civic spirit was evident in the people of Cork who rallied around and tried to deal with a very difficult issue.I do not wish to point fingers of blame but we must address some fundamental issues.  There must be an independent investigation of the management of the water in the Lee area.  An outside body with experience in hydraulics, meteorology and other areas must come together and try to find a solution to this difficulty.  This is not about blaming but about ensuring that it does not happen again.  I urge the Minister of State to consider appointing an outside individual with experience to look at the whole area of water management upstream and downstream of the dam, and the information flow between the ESB and the local authorities, in particular, Cork City Council.The other area of major concern to me is that a city should be fully dependent on a single pumping station on its north side.  This beggars belief.  Its location may have been an oversight in the first place but now we are fully dependent on one pumping station and  there is no link between the various local authorities.  If one pumping station is out of commission or flooded, as was the case here, there should be some system of interconnectivity with local authority water coming from Cork County Council.

It is bad enough to be dealing with the floods but now there is non-availability of water to the homes of 80,000 people.  The emergency services are doing their best but if there had been some forward planning and foresight many of these issues might have been avoided.More fundamentally, water supply must be examined.  An outside organisation should be brought in to analyse the situation clearly, without fear or favour——

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I wish to focus on the situation in Cork which was referred to by the previous speaker. There are two issues, drinking water and severe flooding.  On flooding, I support the call made for an independent inquiry.  We need to know what was responsible for it.  Those people who were washed out of their homes and businesses and public institutions, who suffered damage to property, want answers.  They want to know what went wrong, what might have been done to prevent the situation and, in particular, why they were not given advance warning.Many theories and scenarios have been put forward in recent days.  The only solution is to have an independent inquiry that will provide answers for these people.  On one hand, it appears the local authority did not have enough notice.  Today, the ESB issued a release stating that last Thursday, 19 November, at 10.50 a.m., it informed Cork County Council, Cork City Council and the emergency services of the emerging situation and the imminent flooding.  It issued a media alert warning of the danger of severe flooding in the Lee valley, between the Inniscarra dam and Cork city, a distance of approximately eight miles.  That is the ESB's story.  We do not seem to have the recognition that people in Cork were told of the danger of severe and imminent flooding.We need to have emergency alerts.  Residents must be informed.  Systems such as websites do not seem to work and are not enough.  There are many questions and people need answers if we are to move forward.  There is also the fact that Cork city was dependent on one pumping station.  That does not make any sense in this day and age.  There was not the facility to tap into any other resource in a neighbouring authority which leads to other questions.  We need a national water authority.  Today, however, people are suffering. We need answers as to how this happened and how we can ensure that it will not happen again in the future.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	392	In recent days I visited a number of areas throughout my constituency that were directly affected by the severe flooding damage.  I saw the devastation caused to householders and businesses that have seen their properties damaged.  I wish record my acknowledgement of the tremendous work that has been done by local authority staff, the Garda Síochána, the Army, the emergency services and sub-aqua clubs.  I acknowledge also the volunteers who offered to assist with the recovery measures.Concerning the €10 million EU hardship fund, I hope it will be used to provide for people who do not have adequate insurance cover and that no geographic restriction will be put on it as was put on the last fund tabled in this House.  There is also a need to look at the management of the waters in both the Shannon and Suck valleys because little has been done to maintain the channels or rivers in that catchment area in recent years, including the actual Shannon and Suck rivers.  Due to this lack of maintenance they do not have the capacity to cater for increased rainfall.Will the Minister and the Department consider the proposal put to him and his officials in July 2005 to develop a national wetlands park in the north midlands with a capacity of 18,000 acres that could be flooded up to 4.5 metres and which could provide some protection for the towns of Carrick-on-Shannon and Athlone and provide some relief in this area?  It is appalling that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not prepared to provide funding in respect of augmentation in the case of the Ballinasloe and the Four Roads Mount Talbot water supplies.  In the past, Roscommon Country Council sought to connect these water supplies with the town of Athlone but was refused the funding by the Department.  There is access to a clean supply of ground water but it has been ignored by the Department throughout the country and it has failed to provide the necessary augmentation.  Funding must be provided to alleviate the problems of rising flooding on the roads as well.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I will cut to the chase.  I echo the sense of admiration and team work of the emergency services.  I acknowledge the fact that the Ministers and the Taoiseach have visited the affected areas.  I was concerned when the Taoiseach remarked earlier on inquires made in Europe.  The Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, has indicated an application has been made to Europe.  I spoke with Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, this evening and I understand he, Ms Marian Harkan, MEP, and Pat The Cope Gallagher, MEP, met with EU Commissioner with responsibility for regional development in Strasbourg.  I call on the Minister to confirm this is taking place now or will take place later, to confirm whether senior officials will come here to see the areas affected and if they are willing to work with the Government to alleviate the problems.In the mid-1990s there was help from Europe on a localised scale for Gort.  A European solution is very important in this case.  I concur with the remarks of Deputy Neville.  We have said this must never happen again but there have been floods in my constituency, including south Mayo, Crossmolina, Mulrany and Westport, as recently as this summer.  The people there still await measures for flood protection and await hope of compensation or for studies to be done on what needs to be done.  We must not make these mistakes again.  I call on the Minister to confirm in his concluding remarks whether Europe will help.  We voted "Yes" for the Lisbon treaty, we need help from Europe now and we need a signal from the Government that we will get the required help.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I intend to focus on the southern part of the constituency of Galway East which has been afflicted by severe flooding on numerous occasions.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers present seem to have avoided the anger of the people of south Galway on their visits in the past week.  The people there have been let down on many occasions in the past with regard to drainage and flooding and have no confidence in any promises from visiting Ministers.  At present, 65 major routeways, 40 secondary routes and numerous county roads have been blocked in County Galway, isolating communities and individual farmsteads.The idea that the Government will now provide a €12 million humanitarian effort and €2 million for farming is derisory.  Every penny of that €14 million could be spent in the parish and area between Peterswell to Kiltartan and down to Craughwell to compensate adequately the people who have lost property and farming income as a result of the floods.  As we speak, a five metre high flood streams down the main routeway and has pushed aside a retaining wall on the main routeway and it is not finished yet.  The Minister should recall the events of 1995 when this money is being allocated.  At the time the Red Cross provided relief and it was fair and efficient in the administration.  I call on the Minister to consider the Red Cross as the appropriate agency through which relief is made.  The Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, stated the OPW will shortly engage consultants but I remind him of what took place in 1995.  Some £1.2 million was spent on the Peach report, the outcome of which was nothing but a cost-benefit analysis suggesting no work should be undertaken.  A shovel or spade was never put into the ground in south Galway to alleviate flooding.  I trust this will not happen again.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I put on record and praise the bravery, professionalism and effort of the many people in the public sector in Cork who have worked night and day beyond the call of duty during the past week, including those in the Garda, fire service, Civil Defence, Army, Naval Service and local authorities as well as community leaders working on a voluntary basis.  They have worked among communities in Cork and elsewhere in a spirit upon which we should collectively build.I appeal to the Government and the Minister to ensure that the hardship payments available through community welfare officers and the humanitarian assistance announced today can be accessed quickly and without excessive bureaucracy.  There should not be a lengthy application process with means tests and so on.  We must get money to people quickly while they are in distress and while they need it in the build up to Christmas.  As the floods abate there must be an honest assessment of the lessons we can learn from the successes and failures and of the way in which we performed in the past week, especially in my city of Cork.  An independent inquiry would help that process.I defend the management by the ESB of the dams at Inniscarra and Carrigadrohid.  I spent more than one and a half hours at Inniscarra dam yesterday speaking to the management there.  Given the infrastructure available last Thursday, the options at their disposal were very limited.  Some 90 mm of rain fell in 14 hours.  They sent out two emergency flood warnings on Thursday.  The reality is no one anticipated the level of water flow that evening.  Some 800 tonnes of water was coming into the catchment area above the dams per second.  At its peak, when the floods were at their worst in Cork city, some 535 tonnes or cubic metres had to be released through the dam into the city to avoid water spilling over the top of the dam.  Having examined the graphs of the water levels on the dam, the management made a significant attempt to reduce the level of the lakes in anticipation of the heavy rainfall on Thursday evening.  However, in spite of that they were forced to allow through the volume of water they believed necessary.There was a communications problem between the ESB and the local authorities which trigger the emergency response.  Communications broke down and did not work as they should.  People were not informed as they should have been and if they had been, they could have availed of the opportunity to take things off the floor, move computers from the ground flood upstairs and so on in their businesses and homes.  We could have done some things differently and we must ensure that the next time a proper communications stream between the ESB, local authorities, businesses and the public is in place such that there can be a realistic expectation of what is, literally, coming down the river.  Let us learn the lessons and hold an honest, independent assessment of the performance.  Let us not simply blame people but put in place a new management structure such that we cope better the next time.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I commend all those who responded so quickly at a local and national level to the terrible devastation caused by the flooding and rain in recent days.  We have all witnessed the way in which Government agencies, community groups and volunteers have worked together to try to alleviate the problems experienced by people.  Today, I met the emergency co-ordinating team which draws on everyone from Met Éireann to the Army and others.  They are working around the clock to ensure we can anticipate where further difficulties may arise and to examine the impact of everything from the rainfall to the control of the water at ESB and other co-ordination issues.The response is being seen and people on the ground appreciate it.  One can talk about walls and bridges and dams, etc., but this is a human story.  It has an impact on individuals and their families who have lost their belongings and whose homes have been affected.  My Department, through the community welfare officers, is conscious of that.  I acknowledge the fact that the community welfare officers in the affected areas did not go on strike today.  They were available and set up special clinics to give people assistance.The emergency needs payments and the urgent needs payments have existed for some time but in a case like this, one sees the demand and the response.  People were immediately able to get financial assistance for things such as food and bedding and receive accommodation.  We saw examples of the community welfare officers being able to provide temporary accommodation for up to 50 families in Cork, 74 families in Limerick and 120 families in Clonmel.  The response was very swift without any form filling or bureaucracy.  People say that is the last thing one needs when one is hit with such a crisis.Other practical support was available, for example, families received dehumidifiers to try to dry out their houses.  Our community welfare officers are there and able to give out this money.  The fund is not confined nor is it a determined amount of money, but it is available to meet the needs of families and their homes.  We recognise that only when the floods abate and the rain stops will we see the real extent of the devastation when people go back into their homes and start rebuilding their lives.  Then they will realise what needs to be replaced.  There will be some who do not have insurance and we want to reach them.  That is why the Government announced the humanitarian fund today to provide assistance.  It starts at €10 million.

We had one in 2004 to respond to the flooding in Clonakilty and Clonmel and in 2002 to respond to the flooding around the Tolka in Dublin.  We have established a framework.  We are anxious to draw on local knowledge, not just on the community welfare officers but the local authorities, whether the engineer, the town clerk depending on which was most appropriate, the local gardaí and the local social welfare office.  There may be instances where those people could say that a whole estate was not insured because it was flooded before.  That type of local knowledge is vital for us in distributing the fund.We must give priority to those most in need, those who are homeless, who have children, who are elderly——

People will only realise the real impact on their homes over the next few days and then they can fall back on this humanitarian assistance.  Meanwhile, the exceptional needs and urgent needs funding is available immediately to provide the basics that people need.We cannot, unfortunately, compensate in full or replace in full but we can support people in these difficult times.  That is what we aim to do.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	403	No one was injured or worse last weekend in Cork or in any other part of the country, thank God.  I commend the way the people of Cork have managed in this difficult time without water and will continue to manage until Cork City Council restores supply.  I do not recall ever in my life seeing rain such as fell last Thursday and Friday.  It was unprecedented in the history of the city and the country and in Cork county as well.  I recall flooding in Parnell Place, Oliver Plunkett Street and lower lying parts of Cork city, but never to the extent that we saw last weekend.When the waters were released from the dam at Iniscarra, they completely submerged the waterworks at the Lee Road.  I agree with Deputy Simon Coveney that the ESB had no option but to release those waters as they were about to go over the dam.  If they had gone over the dam, they would have been uncontrolled whereas in the way that they were released they were controlled.  The waterworks in Cork city have been in place for 250 years and have never been flooded or caused any difficulty.  This event was a first in 250 years and I hope that we will not see something like it again.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Six hours after the flooding Cork City Council and Cork County Council had tankers on the ground, thanks to Dairygold, Kerry Co-op and other private owners, to make water available and have it in place when the pipes in the city ran dry.  The water shortage affected 2,000 homes on the south side of the city and 16,000 homes and businesses on the north side.  Cork City Council and Cork County Council and the emergency services, the fire service, Civil Defence and the ambulance services, the Garda, the Army and the Naval Service all played, and are playing, a very significant role in dealing with this crisis.  The community, volunteers, the members of the council and Deputies are all helping in this crisis.I commend the gardaí and in particular Superintendent Con Carrigan of Gurranabraher who has received water supplies from Cork City Council and has organised runs to the vulnerable and older people in the community over the past few days.  The emergency services and the people are looking after the vulnerable in Cork city.  I welcome the visit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Taoiseach to see the damage at first hand.  I welcome what the Minister and Government have done today in making funding available.  I commend all in the emergency services for the role they are playing.  I hope that the water supply in Cork city will be restored by this weekend.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I rise in solidarity with my constituents in Galway east in the most devastating flood we have ever experienced.  The flood levels are at their highest ever, higher than those in 1954.  The people of Ballinasloe all the way into Beithe into Gort and north Galway, Abbeyknockmoy, Ballymoe, Williamstown and through Craughwell and Athenry are in a very serious state.  Tonight, the flood levels have risen by seven feet at Kiltartan Roman Catholic Church in south Galway, famed in history and in literature.  Animals are drowning in sheds.  Water in the Rahasane Turlough, one of the foremost wildlife sanctuaries in the world, is rising rapidly and the people living on that stretch are very worried that they may not be able to survive tonight because the situation is so serious and tragic.  I empathise and sympathise with all of the people.  I thank the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works for their huge commitment and for the hours they have come, early in the morning, late at night and during the day to stand with us in solidarity.

People have had to leave their houses in my constituency, in areas such as Turloughmore and in Frenchfort.The flooding in Galway has happened in three phases.  In the 1990s, there was flooding but nothing was done in the aftermath, except a geographical survey at a cost of IR£400,000.  In 1995, there was even worse flooding and afterwards the Government commissioned the Peach report, an English company that spent nine months in Ireland before producing a report for IR£1.2 million with no further action being taken.  I blame the Government, particularly the Office of Public Works wildlife section.  It has resisted every attempt by local communities to solve the problem.In 1990, Kiltiernan national school, on the Galway to Gort road, between Kilcolgan and Ardrahan, was flooded.  It was closed for six weeks and the children had to go to the hall in Labane.  The village of Caheradoo was cut off for nine weeks with 6 ft. of water on the road, yet nothing was done about it.  In desperation at the time, the local community, helped by me, set up an unofficial drainage scheme that drained the water to the sea at Killeenaran via Ballinderrin five miles away.  I happened to be there yesterday and despite the fact that the flood level is 8 ft. higher than in 1995, the school was free of floods, the Caheradoo road was free and the system was working perfectly.I invite the Minister to come down and see what the local community did on that occasion.  I am disgusted and fed up with reports that we hear no more about once the water subsides.  Action should be taken by the Government.  When the local community did that scheme, it was resisted in every possible way by the Office of Public Works.  The OPW even wrote to the manager and advised him that if he gave us a road opening licence, it would stop all grants for the next two years.  That was the intimidation that went on but we continued and I invite anyone to see how well it works today.  The OPW should allow more action so people can alleviate their own problems instead of finding excuses to stop it.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	422	After a pothole burst a tyre on my way home to Bandon, I eventually got home on Thursday.  It was the worst I have ever seen, Bandon town was like Venice, with the river in full flow through the main streets of the town.  Other towns in west Cork, Skibbereen and Clonakilty, in particular, were similarly badly affected.  There were some silver linings in that there were no deaths or serious injuries, there was unstinting work by the emergency services, and there was a wonderful spirit and neighbourly approach in local communities, where people came out to help people, giving out tea and soup and helping to clean out the muck and mess from the shops.  All the rest, however, was dark clouds, smashed hopes, ruined aspirations, destroyed homes, broken and bankrupted businesses and a pall of desolation over large areas of south-west Cork, including many farms.What can be done?  I would like to see an advance on infrastructural projects that can assist with flooding, along the lines of the sewerage scheme in Bandon, that is ready to go to tender.  Engineers tell me that will assist because of the separation of flood waters from sewerage waters.  I am thinking of flood relief schemes like those in Mallow, which was effective.  Could the similar scheme for Bandon be bumped up the list?We should squeeze the EU solidarity fund.  In 2002, when there were serious floods in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and France, the EU reacted immediately.  Also, we must establish a decent disaster fund.  When I heard about the €10 million fund today, I thought it was for Bandon alone, or possibly Bandon, Skibbereen and Clonakilty.  It is not enough, despite the state of the Exchequer, and we should make a decent fund available.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	423	County Galway tonight resembles a big, wet sock.  It is dripping all over the place and we have 100 roads blocked across the county.  This has never happened before.  The one thing that is vital, be it €10 million, €20 million or €30 million, the people who need it most must get that help quickly.  I agree with Deputy Ulick Burke that the Red Cross did an outstanding job ten years ago and I see no reason not to pull it into the equation.I cannot understand where the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was.  We saw the Taoiseach, we saw the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but there was no sign of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  As far as the farming community is concerned, it is time to stop farm inspections so these people can get out to evaluate how bad the fodder situation is so those who need to get fodder to keep their cattle going can apply to some scheme or other.For those people in Ballinasloe who have never seen anything like the flooding tonight, the Government must ensure that those householders without insurance are given immediate access to whatever fund is set up.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	424	We have seen at first hand in Clonmel the devastation.  Carrick-on-Suir was a great success because of the work done there.  It is a pity the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is gone because the fact of the matter is that the rivers, streams and water courses in the country have not been cleaned for 40 years.  The problem lies on the beds of every river in the country.  The Taoiseach spoke about it today but it has never been dealt with and that is the kernel of the matter as far as I am concerned.  I live in the country beside the Suir and it is blocked up for miles.Earlier today, I spoke to Seán Kelly, MEP.  He has been in touch with the Commissioner for Regional Development who wants to come here if an application is made.  We want clarification so we would know what the application would be for.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I will start with the words of a ten year old child rescued from the waters in Ennis on Thursday: "It was scary, it was really scary, all the water was everywhere.  It was like our house was in a big puddle and all the water was going into the house, just going in and in and would not stop."  Those are the words of Clodagh, a ten year old child who was rescued along with her mother and brother.  There were 37 other families rescued along with them.I met the Taoiseach yesterday when he travelled to see the devastation at first hand.  I commend the work of the gardaí, the Civil Defence, the fire service, voluntary workers and groups who have helped out.  In Ennis on Thursday, there were 42 millimetres of rain, with 36 millimetres in Shannon, compared to a norm of 6 millimetres in heavy rain.  I never thought I would see waves over St. Flannan's College, which I saw on Thursday night when I assisted the emergency services.Tonight we are on high alert again.  The community of Sixmilebridge is divided in two, with the bridge cracked, which will cause huge problems for the area.  There are huge problems in south-east Clare with the flooding and I appeal to ESB to be honest and let the authorities know when it is releasing water.  It should do it early in the morning so the emergency services can see the devastation when Springfield and Clonlara are flooded.This is the worst crisis ever seen in Clare and I hope the Government will offer some assistance.  I have been told there is more to come.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I will be brief.  I join with my colleagues in acknowledging and thanking the emergency services in Cork City and county, the gardaí, the Army, local authority workers, Civil Defence, the Ambulance Service, the HSE, the fire service and community leaders for their tremendous efforts.  The emergency response team in the city under the leadership of Mr. Joe Gavin and the director of services, Ms Valerie O'Sullivan, and in the county under the leadership of Mr. Martin Riordan, the county manager, are doing an exceptionally good job under extremely difficult circumstances.  The first priority must be to restore the water supply for up to 18,000 people in Cork city, including Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and to assess the damage to homes in order that people can return to them as quickly as possible and also to assess damage to businesses.Very soon the focus will shift to the cost of the damage which has been caused.  In August 2008, flood damage amounted to €100 million in terms of insurance claims but it will be a multiple of that amount on this occasion.  The response and behaviour of the insurance companies must be closely monitored in terms of dealing with claims promptly and that they do not use it as an excuse for hiking up insurance premia next year and that they do not refuse insurance cover to people next year who have been affected by floods this year.  The focus will shift very quickly on to those key issues and we have to ensure that is dealt with and that people have the right to report any anomalies in terms of the processing of insurance claims to the financial services ombudsman.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I join in the welcome in Galway to the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, where great work was done by the emergency services and the voluntary sector.  I propose that the Office of Public Works take the lead role in these situations with due respect to the parks and wildlife service and the fisheries bodies.  I suggest the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, look at the work that has just been finished on the River Nanny in north Galway which was overseen by the Office of Public Works.  There is a need to manage our rivers, hence the reason for setting up the sub-drainage boards, including the River Fergus drainage board.  I would like to see more such work.  I have seen what has happened in Abbeyknockmoy, Ballymoe in north Galway, where the River Shiven burst its banks in Newbridge in Ballinamorebridge, and the town of Ballinasloe where there was tremendous hardship.  Effectively, people were cut off from Galway city were it not for the fact that the new motorway was opened ahead of time for which great credit is due.I met members of the IFA who made clear to me the need to widen to Dunkellin River and put in place new bridges and the need to finish off the work on the Kiltiernan-Ballinderreen scheme  which started in 1994.  I hope the funding in place will help individual families, business people and particularly the farming community who suffered major losses.  I welcome the debate today and I hope we get some answers so that we can say to our constituents what the Office of Public Works will do in the future and what funding will be provided by the Government.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I join with my colleagues and thank God nobody was badly injured or killed.  However, I have some serious issues to raise about the situation in my constituency.  I thank the statutory authorities, the gardaí, Civil Defence, the Army in the barracks in Clonmel, the fire service, local authority staff and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for the huge effort they have put in from Thursday night last, following a meeting which I attended, when a major plan was put in place under the guidance of Supt. Eunan Dolan.  Thankfully everybody concerned was rescued and brought to safety and food and other essential items provided.  There was flooding not only in Clonmel but in Ardfinnan upstream and in Knockavilla which resulted from bad planning.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, alluded to that during the weekend.  I commend him, the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on their visits to different areas and empathising with the people.  There are many issues that have to be dealt with.As Deputy Tom Hayes said, it is futile that the rivers are not being drained and the basins cleaned.  Many people objected to such work in Clonmel when the scheme was under way.  These objections will have to be overruled in future because people's properties and homes that have been flooded seven or eight times are far more important to me as a public representative than some other issues about what might be at the bottom of the river.  Older and wiser people always did that work when they had only the horse and cart and shovels.  If we cannot be done now with earth moving equipment, we must re-evaluate and change our attitudes on some of these situations.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I am glad of the opportunity to add my voice to the concerns in regard to the devastation that has taken place in the past week due to the bad weather conditions.  I am pleased to welcome the two Ministers with responsibility in this area, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny there was much devastation, particularly in Carlow town and in many other small towns in Carlow and Thomastown in south Kilkenny.On Friday last, I had to visit five families with young children in rural areas who were flooded.  If and when funding becomes available, I hope these rural areas will not be forgotten.  I realise that Carlow and cities such as Cork and Galway have suffered enormously.  People whose houses were never flooded previously had to move out of their houses.  I ask that all local authorities carry out a survey to ascertain why the flooding took place and that any funding that becomes available would be directed towards those areas.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I wish to put on record the constant fear of the people of Enniscorthy every time the River Slaney overflows which has happened on a regular basis in recent years.  Again last weekend, the River Slaney overflowed and both quays were flooded, causing severe damage to business property and houses.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, visited Enniscorthy last year and announced a new scheme for the town and I ask him to move it on.  There is a need for a public meeting between the local authority, the Office of Public Works and the local people to agree on the best way forward.  The OPW announced the plan without any consultation or dialogue with the local people and as a result nothing has happened.I ask the Minister, in conjunction with the Wexford county manager, Mr. Eddie Breen, to agree a plan for the future. I pay tribute to the great work done by Wexford County Council and Enniscorthy Town Council last weekend.  There is a serious need to progress with the plan to ensure that people particularly on the island road in Enniscorthy, where many elderly people live, are not barricaded in their houses every time there is a heavy rainfall in the south east.  This is not good enough.  I ask the Minister to look at the issue of compensation for shopkeepers and those whose premises were severely damaged last weekend.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I thank the Chair for affording me this opportunity to speak.  I express my sympathy to all those who have been displaced as a result of the recent flooding.  During the August bank holiday weekend in 2008, the town of Newcastlewest was completely swamped by a flood and hundreds of thousands of euro worth of damage was caused to businesses and residents alike.  In the aftermath of the event, it was described as a one in 650 year event and the likelihood of a recurrence was in about 650 years' time.I wish to make two points.  First, constituents of mine were denied humanitarian aid and assistance by the authorities at the time.  I ask that the people of Newcastlewest who are still out of pocket be afforded the opportunity to apply to the fund which is being established today.  The second point concerns the response of the local authorities.  Limerick County Council, in partnership with the emergency service, did not implement the major emergency plan, the definition of which is "beyond the normal capacity of the emergency services", in August 2008 and no answers were given.  In the aftermath of the current event, I ask that a full review be undertaken of the performance of all the major emergency plans which have kicked in up and down the country and to include the reason the major emergency plan was not put into effect in Newcastlecast, County Limerick, in August 2008 and that those who are still out of pocket be afforded the opportunity to apply for humanitarian assistance which is still outstanding.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13502	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Paschal Sheehy may have been on holidays but I understand he was here with us in spirit.I hail from the town of Mallow, which is in the flood plain.  Mallow has been flooding since Adam was a boy but the events of recent days have proven that the flood alleviation works have worked very well for the town.  The flood defences for the first phase worked extremely well.  It is important to acknowledge when work is carried out successfully.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Deputy Sherlock must be going for the Presidency.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13502	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I humbly give praise to the members of Mallow Town Council and its staff.  I refer to George O'Malley and the lads who put on the oilskins and go out year after year when flooding occurs.  There is no fuss.  They just get on with the job because that is what they do.  They do not want praise for it but that work is worthy of acknowledgement because they do it year in, year out.  This year they were out with the demountable walls, working with the area and town engineers, and had those defences up in no time.  That must be acknowledged also.I acknowledge the Minister's statement on the start of phase one in Fermoy but issues remain concerning the clean-up there.  At the risk of being parochial, both sides of the river, particularly at Rathealy Road, Francis Street, Thomas Street, Greenhill and Brian Boru Square on the north side, are all badly affected.  If some form of aid is to be made available, I ask that those residents be eligible for it, as should the people on the south side, particularly at Ashe Quay, the mart road, O'Neill Crowley Quay, Elbow Lane and Tallow Road, which were all badly hit.  It has been said to me that the Fermoy flood was the worst in the past 25 years.  That should be on the record because while we agree the works will commence shortly in Fermoy, some damage remains arising from the flood works in that area.  I ask the Department to examine the damage that has been done and look favourably on the residents and the businesses in that area.There is a stoicism among people who are born in the flood, so to speak.  They get on with life and do the business, but what seems to have characterised the flood events throughout the rest of the country is that they would not normally occur in those areas.  While we will deal with the problems in Fermoy and Mallow, and I visited south Galway at the weekend to see the damage done, it is vital that other parts of the country are examined in the same way as Mallow and Fermoy.It is important that the flood alleviation works due to be carried out in Fermoy do not compromise the amenity that is the rowing club.  There are proposals to carry out works on the weir on the Blackwater in Fermoy but we are concerned they will have a negative impact on the rowing club.  I am aware the Minister made some public statements about that in recent days and I hope he will look favourably on the fact that there is a rowing club in the area and that this amenity cannot be compromised in any way.It is particularly ironic that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party blame the flooding events on bad planning in certain parts of the country.  They might revisit some of their statements in that sense.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	440	Flooding is not a new phenomenon.  People might say that is obvious but sometimes we need to remind ourselves of it.  It happens as a consequence of the weather which, particularly in Ireland, is predictable in its unpredictability.  Many factors cause flooding.  In recent years, we hear much mention of the issue of climate change but there is no proven link between our recent floods and climate change.  It may become a factor in the future and is obviously something we must prepare for and adapt to, but there are other factors including development and rainfall amounts.  In November 2000, flooding occurred in Lucan.  Rain had fallen throughout the month followed by even heavier rain.  The ground became saturated and the water had nowhere to go.  My understanding is that the current flooding throughout the country has been caused by similar conditions in that a lot of rain fell this month and the water had nowhere to go.Flooding is a fact of life.  It happens every year in different areas and at different times.  Last August, very severe flooding occurred in parts of the country.  Our approach has tended to be reactive.  The flood policy review group said our policy was reactive and that we needed to manage the risk of flood, be prepared, minimise the damage and, where possible, avoid flood risk.Bad planning decisions were made in the past but it would be difficult to build without creating some flood risk.  Populations increase.  We have families and therefore houses must be built, but we must implement measures to minimise the flood risk that comes with development, which is a problem with which we must deal.The flood policy review group, which is under the auspices of the Office of Public Works, reported in 2004.  That is Government policy and we should implement it.  It is good policy.  To be fair, good work has been done including the flood mapping and the other aspects the Minister mentioned, but it has been slow.  For example, Goodbody did a report for the OPW in 2008 and it has highlighted the fact that the implementation of that report has been slow and that there had been inadequate resourcing of it.I raise the issue of humanitarian assistance.  When flooding occurred in Lucan some years ago, money was provided through the Irish Red Cross.  The flood policy review group recommended that the Government use the community welfare officers network to provide that funding for hardship but I am not sure that is a good idea.  Many people experiencing hardship as a result of the flooding have never been to a community welfare officer and might believe there is a stigma attached to going to these officers.  In terms of this issue, I do not believe community welfare officers are sufficiently experienced or trained to make a judgment on whether someone should get funding.Under the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Act 1996, the OPW has the power to make schemes or other arrangements for the provision of assistance whether in the form of money, accommodation and so on to those who have suffered by reason of flooding.  There is much to be said for having an agency like that or the Irish Red Cross administering the humanitarian scheme, and it should not be something that is announced a few days after an event.  There should be a standing hardship scheme for people who experience flooding and it should be topped up by the Government when extreme flooding occurs.On the issue of staffing, the Goodbody report for the OPW found that a major problem in terms of the delay of delivery of flood relief schemes, which, as Deputy Sherlock said, work and are a necessary part of Government policy, is manpower deficiencies.  It took a long time for the OPW to get the 30 extra staff it was promised to help it with its work on flood management.  A total of 4,000 jobs have been lost in local authorities throughout the country.  A total of 500 people were let go in Cork County Council.  Those are the conditions in which the council has had to work.  As other speakers said, the work on flood relief by the various agencies has been sterling, but they have been doing it under pressure and with far fewer staff than they had a year ago.  That issue must be addressed.  There must be flexibility.  The Government should provide extra funding to the local authorities that need them and they should be allowed to employ additional personnel if it is necessary to do so.Both the flood policy review group and the Goodbody reports found there has been under-spend on flood relief over the years.  We need sustained, adequate and strategic funding for flood relief schemes because they work.

We talk about innovation, but we are being innovative in what we are doing now.  Members have travelled here from where they live, having observed the conditions in their home areas.  They will speak in the Chamber for two or three minutes and telling it as it is.  That is a remarkable change.  I travelled up to the House today and, therefore, I do not know how this has come about.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I commend whoever proposed the taking of this business because it makes a change.We have all been used to floods.  The people in Athlone have experienced them for many years and 1954 is the year against which all subsequent floods in Athlone are benchmarked.  As a result of the flooding that has taken place in Athlone on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and today, the water is now 3 ft. above the high water mark of the 1954 floods.  I was out today with a friend of mine who spoke to me of the sheer terror that has gripped the town.  The flooding has spread from Parnell Square into The Park, Deerpark Road, Wolfe Tone Terrace, Clonown Road, The Strand, Carrick O'Brien Road, Golden Island and numerous other areas, and the River Shannon is still rising.Deputy Joanna Tuffy correctly pointed out that floods are a natural phenomenon, if one wants to take that perspective, but they are not natural where they subsume houses and leave people terror stricken.  I saw the abject misery and sadness on people's faces today as they were washed out of their homes.  Their Christmas cards and Christmas boxes for their children were all floating in the water.  They cannot get in or out of their houses.  The sheds in which their central heating boilers are located in the back of older houses are completely flooded and those central heating systems are now useless.  I do not know how people will cope.I welcome the humanitarian assistance.  It is a good initiative.  Community welfare officers are good at their jobs.  The Red Cross, on the last occasion, made a great input and distributed relief in a very professional fashion.  Perhaps there could be a marriage of community welfare officers and the Red Cross to distribute relief.I ask that the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, and Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, visit  Athlone on Friday.  I would welcome them and bring them around the town and show them how it has been affected by the floods.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  An unprecedented weather event has taken place.  It has had a devastating effect on many parts of County Clare and, in particular, on our county town.  Those of us who have had an opportunity to visit the sites that have been flooded — I believe all the Oireachtas Members in the House have done that during the past few days — have seen the trauma many families are going through.  Thankfully, counselling is being given to some people and, without a doubt, it is necessary.  To see middle-aged and elderly men crying at the devastation that has befallen their families is very difficult to witness.  Unfortunately, we have had to witness that and we must now work with those families to try to help them not only to rebuild their houses, but their homes and their lives.  I am thankful that the Government has moved today with the introduction of what I believe is the first phase of relief, through the provision of humanitarian aid, to take people immediately out of the crisis they face.  Further funding will be required to ensure that a similar event will not recur or at least that we will work to prevent, in so far as is possible, such an event recurring.I am thankful to the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, and the Taoiseach who visited Ennis and other sites where there is flooding in County Clare over the weekend to see at first hand the crisis citizens and constituents have faced.  I am thankful for that.It would be remiss of me not to recognise the tremendous effort made by the pre-arranged emergency services through the co-ordination of the county council.  The local county council manager, Mr.  Tom Coughlan, has done a fantastic job in conjunction with superintendent John Scanlon and captain Mick Hickey and officer Adrian Kelly from the fire service.  Collectively, they have co-ordinated, through the multi-agency approach, an exceptionally well-designed and well-executed emergency plan.  I have seen it at first hand in many of the sites that have been flooded over the weekend.  I have seen people being evacuated in a very careful and controlled way, with efforts made to limit the difficulties they have encountered.I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who has responsibility for the OPW, for the work the OPW has done, but I appeal to him to recognise there will be an ongoing need to build defences in the areas that have been identified this time, the lack of which contributed to much of the flooding.   I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss this matter in the House again and that I will have an opportunity to lead a delegation along with Deputies Pat Breen and Joe Carey and the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to put forward what is needed in County Clare to prevent further flooding.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I join colleagues in expressing sympathy to all those who have suffered as a result of the flooding and from the very serious disruptions to their homes, businesses and to life in general throughout the country, particularly in Cork city and county, which has experienced unprecedented flooding of a kind never experienced before.  That is the key point.  People have asked what happened.  One fundamental thing happened — more rain fell that Thursday afternoon in a short timeframe than ever fell before.  That is fundamental to the impact of the rainfall on the dam, the release of water and the subsequent flooding.Cork is a low lying area.  I recall that during my childhood areas of city island were always flooded when there was a high tide and so on, but the area where there is flooding on this occasion is one that has never experienced flooding.  I have been told that shops in that area for more than 50 years have not experienced flooding.  There was a breach of the quay wall in Grenville Place, which was unprecedented such was the force of the water.  The flow of the water cascaded down through businesses and inner city housing.  The conditions were so grave at 3 a.m. on Friday that consideration was given to the evacuation of the entire Mercy Hospital.  Only for the sandbagging which held the wall at that location, that was a real possibility.  The accident and emergency department and the lower floor had to be evacuated and equipment had to be moved to the upper floor.  That raises other fundamental question down the line.Only for the intervention of the front line services a greater catastrophe would have unfolded.  We must remember that the front line services have to prioritise.  People will have concerns and will complain, but the bottom line is that no life was lost.  That is something for which we must be thankful and for which we need to pay tribute to the front line services.  The loss of life was a very real possibility, given the enormous volume of water released into the city.  Up to 800 tonnes of water per second was flowing at one stage.  It was unprecedented.  The ESB has described it to the city manager as a one in 800 year event.  There has been incredible damage to houses.  The county library was open that Friday.  It is a €20 million building and everything in it was destroyed, the library archives and so on.  UCC is facing damage of between €15 million to €20 million.  It has lost one fifth of its space in terms of provision for lecture theatres and 2,000 students have been left without accommodation.  These are very severe impacts that we have to take on board.My main concern is to try to restore water as quickly as possible to the approximately 18,000 houses that do not have water, predominately on the north side of the city.  There is a public health concern in that respect and we have to be mindful and attentive to that.  The communications issue Deputy Ciarán Lynch raised is a valid one.  There needs to be mass communication to the people in terms of the next steps to be taken, what is happening and the steps we should take in terms of safeguarding public health.I appreciate the contributions by the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh.  The major initiative on the Lee catchment area, the draft flood risk management plan, needs to accelerated and the necessary steps taken.  The overarching issue is that climate change is with us.  It is a here and now issue, and not something that will happen in future.  That has a dramatic impact on mindsets within local authorities.  I do not believe it has sunk through yet, excuse the pun.  In terms of thinking, I would ask what is the priority of any council.  The priority of the city council in Cork should be the protection of the city from here on in terms of quay walls and bridges because there will be many more such events.  Irish Aid has examined the global incidents of major weather catastrophes.  The number of such incidents has increased by more than 160% in more than a decade.  That is the type of incident of which we will see more.  Therefore, we have to change the prioritisation of issues for the future to protect against flooding.  I appreciate the humanitarian aid that is being made available.  The Lee treatment works have been there for 250 years.  Hindsight is a great virtue, but we are all claiming hindsight of 250 years with regard to it.  However, its location beneath the dam is an issue for the future.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	448	That was a very fast four and a half minutes.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I wish to record my thanks to the emergency services in County Clare and compliment the inter-agency approach that was taken in setting up a telephone number to deal with all queries in Ennis and the rest of the county.  Undoubtedly, this has been the worst flooding in living memory.  Parts of Ennis which are flooded now were never flooded previously.  I acknowledge the fact that the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, visited Ennis.Huge mistakes have been made in Ennis.  The flood relief scheme which is under construction nearly pushed the water further up to Francis Street and Abbey Street.  The water caused utter devastation for businesses and the residents who were evacuated.  I compliment the 20 Army personnel and five vehicles that were made available.  Probably more should have been provided because the emergency personnel were under huge pressure.  Sandbags were in short supply and there are no pumps in the town of Ennis or throughout County Clare to pump water out.  Tonight, a woman from Elm Park told me on the telephone that her house is surrounded by water.  She does not know what to do.  There is sewage in the water and she fears it will get into her house.The Minister must make himself available to the people of County Clare and hold an urgent meeting to decide what can be done.  He must give some assurance to them that this will never happen again.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	451	It has been harrowing to see the damage to houses, businesses and farms and how upset people are in the areas affected.  I compliment the staff of the local authorities and emergency services on their work.  My home town of Boyle, Carrick-on-Shannon, which is virtually under water, and Rooskey have been dealing with this for the last four or five days.  The Minister visited all parts of the country but the people of the towns I mentioned were hurt and upset that he did not visit that area to see the damage that has been done.  I hope he and the Taoiseach will visit the area at the earliest opportunity.  The people genuinely felt let down that the Minister did not come further north of the Shannon.Many people have said that locks should have been opened.  They want an independent investigation of what happened, and I hope that will take place.  A flood management system must be provided in the area.  People are very concerned that there will be no compensation.  I hope that something similar to what was organised with the Irish Red Cross in 1995 will be put in place to provide compensation to the people affected.  They need hope and help.  Deputies and councillors travelling through the area tried to give them hope in this desperate situation.  I urge the Minister to come to the area at the earliest opportunity to see the damage.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I represent the people of west Cork, particularly the people of Bandon, Skibbereen and Clonakilty, who have been so badly affected by flooding since last Thursday.  In Bandon, one could have sailed a boat up and down the town.  The same was true of Skibbereen.  This is due to the lack of dredging and clearing of the River Bandon and the River Ilen in Skibbereen.  Fifteen years ago, Cork County Council made an application to the Department for funding to carry out that work, but nothing has been done about it since then.  In fact, I ploughed into 4.5 ft. of water on the main Ballineen-Dunmanway road last Thursday night on my journey home.  Fortunately, I was able to reverse and take a detour.  I arrived in Skibbereen to find the Irish Red Cross, the fire brigade and other services with all roads into the town blocked.  It took me three and a half hours to get from Cork city to Goleen, a journey I usually complete in one and a half hours.An early warning system is needed, especially for the rivers that have dams, the Inniscarra and Parteen.  They must be monitored every 24 hours and the water let down to a level to prevent flooding.  If that had been done, there would not have been the catastrophe that befell the County Hall and the Kingsley Hotel in Cork.  They are beyond redemption.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I commend the emergency services who responded to the flooding in Enniscorthy on Thursday and Friday last week.  There are ways to alleviate the problem of flooding.  The former Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, referred earlier to the dredging of the River Slaney in Enniscorthy and what the Office of Public Works proposes to do in building flood barrier walls without any consultation with the general public or local business people.  It just rolled over the general public in Enniscorthy.There are many organisations involved if one wishes to get rivers dredged — the parks and wildlife service, the Office of Public Works, the county council, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the fisheries boards.  These are mind-boggling organisations.  A critical infrastructure Bill was introduced in this House a number of years ago.  A similar Bill should be introduced to provide for dredging rivers, which would alleviate the problems that occurred in Enniscorthy, and to stop all these do-gooder organisations who have been trying to prevent the dredging of rivers.  Dredging rivers throughout the country, including the river in my constituency, would alleviate many of the problems, rather than erecting flood barrier walls to drive the river waters further down onto landowners.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I sympathise with my constituents in Shannon Banks, Castleconnell and Montpelier who had their homes and lands flooded.  I also sympathise with those who will not sleep tonight, especially in Westbury, as the Shannon continues to rise.  It is a very serious issue.The ESB controls the level of the water in the Shannon from Parteen to Limerick city and beyond.  The protocols that govern its behaviour must be re-examined with regard to how it co-ordinates with the local authorities and particularly how it communicates with local residents.  The interchange of information with local authorities is good, but the information does not always reach the residents in sufficient time to allay their fears or allow them to make arrangements to move out.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, would restore the programmes that existed in the past for carrying out small works on rivers, such as removing fallen trees, cutting overhanging branches which frequently impede the flow of water by 30% to 35%, taking the silt from river beds, repairing broken levees, clearing culverts and the other small works that were habitually carried out 30 and 40 years ago but which do not appear to be carried out anymore.  That has a huge effect.Finally, I hope that whoever administers the financial package will do it equitably in all areas and among all victims.  This did not always happen in the past.  It must be seen to be fair, whatever the smallness or largesse of the package.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I thank my colleagues, Deputy Enda Kenny and Deputy Phil Hogan, for forcing this important debate.  I am disappointed and angry that the Taoiseach and the Green Party did not see fit to recall the Dáil over the weekend to deal with this issue.  I sympathise with the people throughout the country whose farms, homes and businesses have been flooded.My constituents are victims of the Government's failure to deal effectively with the management of the River Shannon.  I have advocated better management of the River Shannon in both this House and the Seanad and have outlined my proposals for the establishment of a River Shannon authority.  Such legislation is essential for the protection of those who live in proximity to the river, which divides the east from the west of the country.  It is urgent that a River Shannon authority be established by statute.  Such an authority was promised by some Members of the House as long ago as 1981, but it has not happened.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I would like the Deputy to recall what she promised 800 people at a public meeting in Athlone back in 1991.  This is something that has not happened.  It is why so many people are victims of serious flooding today.  The key to alleviating flooding for those in rural areas is to maintain waterways.  Several Members have spoken about cleaning and dredging rivers, but this has not happened since the arterial drainage scheme of the 1960s.  It is shameful for the Government to have neglected the people of this country. Ministers come in here and shed crocodile tears and pretend that they are doing something, but they are doing nothing.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	457	Deputy Bannon never got to Athlone.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	458	We must move on to questions.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	459	We would have had no debate here this evening but for the intervention of our party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny.  I am disappointed that four Deputies from my constituency have not come here this evening.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	460	Why did Deputy Bannon not come to Athlone?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I ask Deputy O'Rourke not to interrupt.  Members should recall the seriousness of the matters we are discussing.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	462	Exactly.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	463	We now have some time for questions.  I would ask Members to be concise in putting their questions.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, or any other Minister, may respond on behalf of the Government.  I call Deputy Phil Hogan to put the first question.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I have a number of questions.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works has said he agrees with Fine Gael's view that an early-warning system is required.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Which Aire?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	466	When will the consultants be appointed and what timescale does he have in mind for implementing that scheme?  Early intervention is critical for people at this stage.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs should recognise that community welfare officers are already overburdened with work.  Perhaps another mechanism could be used, such as the Red Cross or other organisations, to implement humanitarian assistance.Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government agree with our suggestion to assess independently the protocols on communication or other matters that obviously fell down in some places in respect of the heavy rainfall?  Will he put in place the necessary protocols to ensure that this does not happen again?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I believe that the consultants will be appointed in the next couple of months.  It is a vital priority.  The events of the last five days mean that we will have to reassess everything we do in two ways — first, to see what matters we can accelerate and, second, to see what gaps are appearing in the system and which we have not fully taken account of.  What has happened is by far the worst flooding incident in the country that I can remember, so we must act quickly.  In fairness, it should be mentioned that public representatives — including Deputies and Senators, as well as town and county councillors — are among those who have rendered assistance throughout the country.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Deputy Hogan raised the question of communication.  I am glad his colleague, Deputy Coveney, put on record the situation regarding the ESB's Inniscarra station, which was clearly unprecedented.  Deputy Coveney had a 90-minute meeting with the ESB representatives.  Deputy Hogan will understand at this stage that his colleague's version is correct.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I do not accept that any version is correct until it is independently assessed.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	470	The Deputy is correct.  There will be an assessment.  The national director for fire and emergency management, Mr. Seán Hogan, will revert to me with his assessment of the situation.  We will look at all aspects of this matter.  Clearly, we must learn lessons every time such a situation arises, even though we have not experienced this sort of rainfall in the past.  I do not agree with Deputy Tuffy who said that this has nothing to do with climate change.  Her own colleague, Deputy Lynch, had a different view on that.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The Minister should provide a brief reply as I have a long list of Members who wish to put questions.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The fact is that while one cannot actually prove a causal link, it is clear that this is entirely consistent with all the scientific evidence we are now getting.  I have produced report after report on that.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	473	There will be some kind of investigation into exactly what occurred and we will wait to see what the fallout from that is.  I want to ask the Minister about the hardship fund.  Can we take it that the criteria for means testing money from community welfare officers will not apply in this case?  Can we ensure that they will not apply?  People are at a huge loss through flood damage to their homes, furniture and clothing.  In the run up to Christmas, it would be grossly unfair to place the type of restrictions that normally apply to funds provided by community welfare officers.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	474	It is a hardship fund so some element of means testing must be involved.  Nonetheless, I accept what previous speakers said about having too much bureaucracy.  We will try to avoid that.  In answer to Deputy Hogan's point, I believe that community welfare officers are the right people to do this work because they have local knowledge.  Good and all as the Red Cross is, it is not locally based.  It is intended that community welfare officers, in conjunction with local authorities and local gardaí, will be able to identify real needs.  They will be able to assist us in that regard.  We intend to set up that system quickly so that we can respond immediately.  In that context, we will have to prioritise older people, parents with young children and those who have been made homeless as a result of the floods.  Those are our priorities.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	475	The last time we had a flood like this in Cork, we got relief.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	476	It is not fair for the Deputy to intervene twice because other Deputies want to contribute.  I call Deputy Denis Naughten.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I have a couple of brief questions.  First, I am surprised that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food did not make a contribution during the debate, given the impact the floods are having on the agricultural sector.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	478	He was here earlier.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	479	He was here but he did not make a contribution.  Can someone explain the criteria that apply to the €2 million fund for agriculture, given that the Minister was not prepared to make any comment regarding it?My second question is for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Law Reform.  Will an immediate capital budget be made available to replace embankments and raise road surfaces for marooned communities?Can the Minister for Social and Family Affairs say whether the hardship fund will include, or exclude, businesses that may not have insurance cover because of serious flooding in the past?  Will there be geographic restrictions on the hardship fund, as was the case in the past?  There have been some serious hardship cases in my constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I cannot allow multiple questions.  It is not fair to other Deputies.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I have two final questions.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The Deputy should not ignore the Chair.  Deputies should prioritise their questions before they are called.   I call the Minister.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	483	In the past, that fund has not supported businesses because they normally have insurance cover.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	484	Some do not.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	485	We will have to assess those to see what the need is, but it is intended as a humanitarian fund for individuals and families.  It is not our intention that the fund would be restricted geographically, but we will be doing an immediate assessment of the requirements.  It is only when the floods abate that we will see the genuine need for replacement of goods and furniture.  Urgent needs are being met now by community welfare officers.  People can get exceptional and urgent needs payments to cover food, bedding and accommodation.  The humanitarian fund will be able to help people in the longer term.  In a few months time that fund will still be there for people.The Deputy asked about the €2 million agricultural fund.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food intends to target that fund as a support for fodder where particular difficulties arise.

We are expecting applications to be made before the end of the year.With regard to other infrastructure, it is difficult to provide answers in the abstract.  We will be working with the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a case-by-case basis in order to establish who should assume responsibility.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13502	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, stated that development on flood plains should be avoided, where possible, and that development should mitigate, not add to, existing risk.  Mallow Town Park is located on a flood plain.  It was owned by the Jephson family, which also owned Mallow Castle.  A descendant of that family sought to have the Mallow town development plan materially contravened in order that the land within the flood plain might be developed.  There has been a constant battle on Mallow Town Council in respect of this matter.  The people of Mallow want to ensure that the park will be held by them in perpetuity for the common good.  In light of the Minister of State's comments, will the Government entertain the possibility of compulsorily purchasing the land in question in order that it might be held for the people?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	488	That is a question in respect of which the Deputy would be obliged to provide proper notice.  Does the Minister of State wish to reply or does he wish to take note of the Deputy's question and respond in due course?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I am familiar with the matter to which the Deputy refers.  We will be obliged to take a more rigorous attitude in respect of issues such as this.  People appear to be of the view that if they own land, then they must be allowed to pursue any development opportunities relating to it.  The flood guidelines will allow us to take a more rigorous approach.  I hope these guidelines will be applied not only by local authorities, but also by An Bord Pleanála.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	490	Will the Minister and Minister of State make a commitment that the two rivers in my constituency, namely, the River Ilen, which runs through Skibbereen, and the River Bandon, which runs from Dunmanway to Bandon town, will be dredged?  The banks of the River Bandon are completely overgrown with brambles, etc., and have collapsed at certain points.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The Deputy has already contributed to the debate.  He should ask a question.

Community welfare officers are already dealing with major backlogs.  People in Loughrea were obliged to queue in the rain in order to see their local officer.  Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provide assurances that those assessing claims are properly trained and familiar with the task required of them?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I accept that community welfare officers are under a great deal of pressure and I recognise that they will require further resources in order to be in a position to administer the fund.  My Department, in conjunction with the groups to which I referred earlier, will consider the level of resources required and the mechanisms best suited to delivering the money.

This water must be disposed of because cattle cannot lie down.  Why is there such resistance on the part of the OPW to local groups which have put forward obvious solutions in the context of draining their areas through suitable outfalls?  I am aware, from personal experience, that every possible obstacle is placed in people's way in this regard.

This should, perhaps, contribute to lessening the need that exists in the context of the matter to which the Deputy refers.

As various contributors to the debate indicated, there are different interests involved, such as boat clubs, fishermen and environmentalists.  We must consider what is the correct balance in respect of these.  In light of the disaster by which we have been affected, an element of rebalancing may be required.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	507	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government referred to the major emergency management plan and protocols relating thereto.  I accept in advance that he may not be in immediate possession of the information I am about to request and I am prepared to have it sent to me at a later date.  What consideration was given to managing the flow of water through the Inniscarra dam when formulating the risk assessment in respect of Cork city and its environs?  What risks were identified in the relevant document and, given that Cork has always been susceptible to flooding, what plans were put in place in this regard?  In the context of the major emergency management plan, what equipment was recommended to the local authority and fire service in the context of managing the anticipated flooding of the Cork area?

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in a position to confirm that in response to a request from members of the fire service regarding the provision of heavy-volume pumps to deal with emergencies such as that which occurred at the flooded pumping station in Cork city, he advised that this equipment could be borrowed from either the OPW or the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service?  Can he confirm that the OPW possesses such equipment?

The OPW does possess the pumps to which he refers.  I will obtain for him a full assessment in respect of the other equipment that was requested.  I have no knowledge of some of the claims the Deputy is making.

I will be happy to procure for him the information he has requested.  We will be carrying out an assessment in the coming days.  Mr. Seán Hogan from the national directorate for fire  and emergency management, who is present in the Chamber, will assist me in compiling the relevant information and forwarding it to the Deputy.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I have a list of speakers which includes Deputies Joe Carey, Pat Breen, Tom Hayes, Seymour Crawford, James Bannon, Mary O'Rourke, Frank Feighan and Dan Neville.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	517	What about Deputy Joanna Tuffy?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I will add her name to the list.  I intend to call on Deputies in the order in which their names appear on the list.  In such circumstances, I call Deputy Joe Carey.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I visited the West County Hotel in Ennis on Sunday last and I met people who had been evacuated from their homes.  The major concern expressed by those of them who live in local authority housing is that, in the aftermath of the floods, the Government will not provide funding to the councils in order that their homes might be refurbished.  Their concerns are well founded because Ennis Town Council has been cash starved by the Government.  If one is looking for a door or a window, one must make a contribution.  Will the Minister make a commitment to provide the money required to bring the local authority housing in Ennis up to standard for people who have been affected by the flooding?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The Deputy has asked for a commitment to upgrade local authority housing.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Minister referred to the ESB and Inniscarra.  Has he had discussions with the company regarding the release of water at Ardnacrusha?  Is he satisfied everything was handled properly there?  Will he comment on the IFA president's statement at the weekend that there are too many bodies in charge of our rivers?  Is that a contributing factor to what happened in our rivers?  They are all blocked and no agency has full responsibility for them.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I visited the West County Hotel in Ennis last Saturday and I met a number of evacuees.  I received word informally about a problem relating to Ardnacrusha and I informed the Taoiseach before he went into the interdepartmental meeting.  I suggested questions needed to be raised and I am sure they have been asked.  The Deputy stated too many agencies have responsibility.  We live in a democracy and there are many interests involved.  Deputy Sherlock referred to the boat club in Fermoy and so on.  One cannot impose.  The OPW tries to achieve a sufficient consensus among the different interests about what it will do.  We do not go ahead in opposition to all the interests in a town.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Someone must be in charge.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	527	On the climate change issue, Met Éireann stated such events have happened before and are within the realms of natural variability.  Housing development is a major factor in flooding throughout the world.  When will the climate change adaptation strategy be ready?  A warning system will be part of that.  In 2004, some €1 million was supposed to be provided to Met Éireann for such a system.  Why has it taken so long to implement that recommendation of the flood review group report?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	528	We have worked well with Met Éireann.  Its staff are part of the emergency team and any resources required for emergency services have been provided and they will be provided in the future.  The adaptation strategy will be published in 2010.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Warning systems are in operation on the Rivers Suir and Blackwater.  They give several hours notice of flooding.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Will the Minister consider giving funds to local authorities to deal with rural roads that have been washed away?  Piping is also badly needed on housing estates.  The Minister of State knows Lagganstown well.  Four houses in the middle of the countryside were under three feet of water.  Planning permission was granted by the county council, yet 200 yards of piping are needed.  Has the Minister plans to give local authorities funds to carry out emergency works between now and the end of the year?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The provision of those funds is a matter for the Minister for Transport.  Much of that money is provided from motor taxation.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Was it discussed at Cabinet earlier?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	533	Yes.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	534	When the flooding recedes, will the Minister of State seriously examine how rivers and streams are maintained?  Nothing has been done in my county since 1985.  Climate change is blamed and while I do not doubt it is a factor, we cannot ignore the maintenance of our rivers and streams.  Much of the damage done to roads and so on in my county is a direct result of the lack of maintenance.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	535	A number of local authorities have done this over the past few years.  They are intensifying the cleaning of drains and waterways and the OPW is trying to do that as well.  It is unrealistic to think that any amount of cleaning of rivers and streams would have prevented the flooding we have witnessed over the past few days.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	536	It would have helped.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	537	Has the Minister plans to establish a River Shannon authority to co-ordinate the development and management of the waterway?  It stretches 242 miles from County Cavan to the Shannon Estuary.  Do I take it from the response to Deputy McCormack's question that the Minister is contemplating easing the regulations and marking provision for farmers to empty waterlogged slatted sheds in the interest of animal welfare.  When will the OPW embark on taking the filth and vegetation out of the River Shannon?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	538	A water framework directive is in place and the river basin district management plans will be published soon.  We have onerous targets to achieve by 2015.On the matter of the slatted sheds, Deputy McCormack referred to officials from my Department snooping around.  I have no knowledge of that.  I am afraid it is another urban myth.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	539	This is refreshing.  Will someone get a grip on the insurance companies?  They are engaged in a massive move away from all responsibility and they are hiking their rates enormously.  Will the three Ministers visit Athlone on Friday please?
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	540	Deputy Bannon will be there.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	541	My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will visit Athlone.  I do not know what my commitments are yet, but I would like to go.  I have been in the town with the Deputy discussing the issue of the River Shannon and how the local authority would take water from the river.  Ironically, there is too much water in it now.  I will speak to the Deputy later about this.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I may not visit on Friday but it will be some time over the weekend.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The issue raised by Deputy O'Rourke about insurance companies is important.  It is critical that they face up to their responsibilities because the humanitarian aid and exceptional needs payments, etc., are generally given to people who do not have insurance.  The insurance companies need not think that the State will step in and relieve them of their responsibilities.  We will get that message across to them.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	544	If an agreed emergency plan was in operation, why was there a distinct lack of sandbags in every local authority area?  When I asked for sandbags, why was I told to go to a supplier and pay €3 per sandbag?  That is wrong.The emergency services did not attend various floods because of a lack of funding.  If the Minister is in the area, will he please visit north Roscommon and south Leitrim because Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon have been badly hit?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	545	The Minister will be on a permanent tour.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The Deputy's questions have a number of implications.  His assessment differs from the one I received.  We will get a thorough assessment, which will be conducted in the context of a successful operation carried out by all the emergency services.  When I visited Ennis, for example, the Defence Forces were filling 200 sandbags an hour.  It was a successful operation.  If there were deficiencies elsewhere, we will hear about them and those deficiencies will become part of the assessment.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I have just one question.  The Government announced today that it has a humanitarian assistance budget, but I believe the assistance of €10 million is inadequate.  By what criteria will that money be distributed?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	548	Exceptional and urgent needs payments are being paid out immediately by community welfare officers for people who need immediate basics such as food, shelter, accommodation, bedding and furniture.  The welfare officers have been paying that and will continue to pay it.  Those payments are not a cash limited fund because they are made on a one-to-one basis based on the needs of the person.  We expect welfare officers to continue paying these over the next few weeks.The humanitarian assistance will be a means tested payment, but we will aim to ensure that we do not have huge bureaucracy attached to it.  It will largely cover people who do not have insurance.  The assistance will kick in when the clean-up starts, which will be over the next few days when people start to identify what they need to replace in their homes in order to facilitate them going back into their homes.  Humanitarian assistance is targeted at that area.We will also try to identify those in most need of assistance within the groups, such as those who have been made homeless, elderly people, people with young children and people with disabilities, and try to prioritise their needs.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	549	Does the Government plan to put a fund aside for infrastructure that has been destroyed as a result of increased water flow?  I know, for example, that at least two bridges in County Cork have been entirely destroyed.  Will the local authority have to find the funding to pay for those or will national funding be provided?  In light of the volume of rainfall we had recently, will the Department work with the ESB to re-evaluate the flood risk from the two dams at Inniscarra?  Will the Minister work towards trying to achieve infrastructure that will ensure that we have two sources for all drinking water supplies?  Our electricity grid has two sources so that if electricity is cut from one source, the power will come from the other.  We should apply the same principle to water supply so that if water is cut off because of an emergency such as the one we had in Cork, we will have an alternative supply.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	550	With regard to water infrastructure, I spoke directly to the managers in Cork on Friday evening and Saturday morning on the issue of the plant on Lee Road.  I confirm that any damage that must be repaired will be dealt with and we will work with the local authorities in that regard.  The Deputy's suggestion to have two sources of supply is constructive.  However, these issues must be addressed in the context of the forthcoming adaptation plan we hope to publish in 2010.Both I and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, must consider the question of the ESB and flood risk from dams.  This is something we will have to consider in the assessment.  The Deputy was out of the Chamber earlier when I complimented him on how he put on record the situation with regard to the ESB-Inniscarra station.  In any assessment we do, we will have to look at the situation there and find out how we can avoid any further situations such as we have currently.  Sometimes, no matter how well we plan and try to prepare for all contingencies, events such as we have had and the kind of rainfall we experienced make this difficult.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I just want to add that the issue of managing water levels in the Inniscarra dam will be examined.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	552	In terms of the capacity of the proposed facility it is my understanding that the quantities of residual waste currently being collected by the Dublin local authorities may not be sufficient to meet the volumetric contractual commitment which forms part of the public private partnership agreement between Dublin City Council and its private partner.  We have recently seen further increases in recycling rates in Dublin, with a corresponding drop in residual waste volumes.  In addition, the recommendations of the report which I commissioned to underpin the review of waste management policy provided for in the Programme for Government would have the effect of further reducing the volumes of residual waste generated, and driving more waste towards recycling.In these circumstances I have decided that the most appropriate course of action is to appoint an authorised person under section 224 of the Local Government Act 2001 to conduct a full review of this project. It remains open to Dublin City Council to engage with my Department to discuss any necessary adjustment to the project which might be necessary to bring it into line with the emerging reality of the waste market and waste policy generally.I am in the process of identifying suitable candidates with the appropriate qualifications to act as authorised person.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I propose to take Question Nos. 52 and 56 together.Following a High Court judgment in 2008 in relation to the planning process that governs granting of exempted development status in the Docklands area, I am aware the Authority completed an assessment of its planning procedures and introduced a number of changes to the process at the start of this year.The amendments to the process allow for an additional level of consultation with property owners, residents and others with a property interest within the relevant area. Site notices are being posted on proposed development sites and observations and/or objections can be made by affected property owners at no cost in relation to a planning application.The Authority is currently carrying out, on my request, a comprehensive review of its corporate governance which will include further expert analysis of its planning function.  I expect the corporate governance report to be submitted to me around the end of November.  I will consider what further changes to the planning process might be warranted once I have had an opportunity to consider the report and any recommendations arising.As I indicated in reply to Priority Question No. 45 on today's order paper, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority secured valuations for its main property assets, including the Irish Glass Bottle Site, for its 2008 Annual Accounts. The accounts show a "red book" valuation for the site of €50m.KPMG, as auditors, for the Authority drew attention to the risks and uncertainties associated with the valuation of property assets, particularly under current market conditions, where property assets are relatively illiquid, there is significant market uncertainty, and there are few if any prospective buyers and no bank finance available to support large scale transactions in the property market.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 54 together.The number of households transferring from Rent Supplement to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) has increased year on year since RAS commenced in 2005.  At the end of October 2009, a total of 23,469 households had been accommodated under the scheme.   This included 6,915 households in 2008, some 38% ahead of the 5,000 target set, and 5,458 households in the first 10 months of 2009, which provides a solid basis for the achievement of this year's target of 7,000 transfers by year-end.In terms of financial resources, some €53 million was devoted to the scheme in 2008.  This year, funding of €90.5 million has been provided, some €76.2 million of which had been expended to the end of October.While information on the number of persons who have applied for RAS is not held by my Department, it should be noted that the main qualifying criterion for the scheme is that a person should be in receipt of rent supplement for a period of 18 months or more.  From information in relation to the operation of the rent supplement scheme, which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I understand that at end September 2009, 33,359 rent supplement supported households, nationally, met the 18 month criterion.While this is broadly comparable to the approximately 32,000 households in the "18 month plus" category when the scheme became operational in 2005, this masks very considerable progress made in the intervening period.  A comparative analysis of the "18 month plus" cases in 2005 and 2008 shows that a large proportion of the original RAS cohort have in fact been dealt with but, in overall numerical terms, they have been replaced by a broadly equivalent number of new "18 month plus" households.  Looked at another way, if the RAS scheme was not in place, the number of households in receipt of rent supplement would be some 23,500 higher than is currently the case.In addition, to the progress made in relation to transfers, the RAS has also been successful in delivering value for money. One of the main objectives for RAS, other than to provide greater security to tenants, was to improve the standards of accommodation. To date, of the 12,611 households who have been accommodated in private or voluntary housing under RAS, over a third have been housed in newly sourced accommodation (i.e. accommodation not in existing use for rent supplement purposes), which is generally of a higher standard and more suitable than the accommodation occupied by the households concerned while in receipt of rent supplement.On the whole, I am satisfied that the Rental Accommodation Scheme continues to meet its objectives.  On the basis of progress already made, I am confident that by end 2009, some 25,000 households will have been accommodated through the scheme since its inception.

This decision arises from the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce a directly elected Mayor of Dublin, and from the considerations in the Green Paper on local government which I published in April 2008.The Government's decision to introduce a directly elected Mayor of Dublin will deliver significantly strengthened leadership for the city and region, with enhanced accountability and a direct connection with the citizen.The timing of the introduction of the Mayor is unchanged — I intend that mayoral elections will be held next year. Given this intention, it will be necessary to have the relevant legislation in place in advance. To these ends, I will bring a draft scheme of a Bill to Government in the coming weeks to provide for the Dublin Mayor.The proposed White Paper on Local Government will set out policy on a wide range of local government issues. The Government decision to introduce a directly elected Mayor for Dublin in 2010, and the legislation to provide for it, marks a first step in implementing broader local government change. Many of the policy decisions in the White Paper will require further legislative change over the coming years.The White Paper, which I will bring to Government shortly, will also reflect the commitments made in the renewed Programme for Government in respect of local government, including the strengthening of the strategic role and functions of regional authorities.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register. The focus of my Department's work in relation to the Register is to support and assist registration authorities in this regard, including  through ensuring that an appropriate legislative framework is in place and developing best practice guidelines for registration authorities.The Programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission which will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight, implement modern and efficient electoral practices, revise constituency boundaries, take charge of compiling a new national rolling Electoral Register, take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission relating to election spending and examine the issue of financing the political system.The renewed Programme for Government, agreed in October 2009, reaffirms the commitment to establish an Electoral Commission which will, amongst other things, be responsible for administering the voting registration process.  The question of the use of PPS numbers for electoral registration purposes will be fully considered in the context of the work relating to the planned Commission.

This also involves other Departments with responsibilities in the area, and entails a considerable amount of work especially given the case law now emerging from the European Court of Justice which is expanding our understanding of the Directive.In the area of transposition, new consolidated Regulations to transpose the Birds and Habitats Directives are at an advanced stage of drafting and address issues raised by the European Court of Justice. These update and consolidate the existing Habitats Regulations 1997 to 2005 and will go to public consultation early in the new year.  I also intend introducing an amendment to the Planning Bill currently before the Oireachtas to provide for appropriate assessment in accordance with the Habitats Directive.  This will clarify the responsibilities of planning authorities in regard to full compliance with the requirements of the Directives and give full effect to the Directive. In parallel with this, a programme of updating the designation of Special Protection Areas is underway and consultation with affected landowners is in train.On the question of implementation, work is underway in the areas of agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries, forestry, and planning and development. I am confident that the transposition update that I am undertaking will facilitate greatly improved compliance with the Directive. This will be supported by comprehensive guidance from my Department for planning authorities. Working guidance for planning authorities on implementing appropriate assessment will be issued by the end of the year.

On taking up office I committed to a major review of how we manage our waste in line with a commitment in this regard in the Programme for Government.It is clear that we need a regulatory framework which properly addresses the ownership of waste, facilitates the management of waste at the highest possible level of the waste hierarchy, and addresses the costs of waste management in Ireland which are seen to be out of line with other countries. Utilising a report prepared for me by consultants to underpin the policy review, and which I published last week, I will be bringing a new policy statement to Government with a view to its publication as early as possible in 2010. This will provide certainty for those in the waste management sector and a framework within which the necessary legislative changes can be brought forward. In the interim it will allow local authorities to begin to tailor their waste management plans and strategies to the new reality.

While ensuring that the full range of needs continues to be met, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.I am determined to ensure that the programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the delivery of social housing.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address housing needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities .
To this end, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded. For example, I announced earlier this year the introduction of a new Social Housing Leasing Initiative, through which it is expected that a substantial number of dwellings will be provided in the years ahead to meet housing needs, estimated at just over 56,000 households in the 2008 Housing Needs Assessment.   This, together with the Rental Accommodation Scheme, complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.I will be keeping the leasing initiative and all the other housing programmes under ongoing review to ensure that they are appropriately geared towards meeting the maximum level of housing need.

This work has involved consultation with key Government Departments and State agencies as well as environmental NGOs. I want to ensure that this framework legislation will enshrine important underpinning policies and principles in Irish law which will underpin our commitment to the core national priority of combating climate change.  I intend to publish a framework document in early December outlining the key areas that will be covered in the Climate Change Bill.  Work will continue on the further development of the Heads, which I intend to publish early in 2010.The Second Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change, published recently, outlined proposals for a climate change bill in an explanatory memorandum attached to the Report.  I welcome the valuable work carried out by the Committee and this work will assist in informing the drafting of the Climate Change Bill.  The fact that it has all party support will be important in gaining public acceptance and support for the Bill.

There are pressures on resources at all levels.  Therefore local authorities must introduce efficiencies where possible, prioritise their expenditure to focus on essential services, and maximise the use of all resources available to them.As part of the Transforming Public Services (TPS)  initiative, my Department and the local government sector are working closely together to advance initiatives for a more integrated public service which will achieve better value for money and enhanced customer service.  In this context, the local government sector is focusing in particular on the promotion of shared services, procurement and e-government.Considerable work has already taken place across local government in these areas.  For example, the merger of the Local Government Management Services Board (LGMSB) and the Local Government Computer Services Board (LGCSB) is well advanced and will provide a significant platform for expanding shared services delivery in local government.  A HR system has also been developed on a shared basis and is extended to 27 local authorities.  A shared service facility in relation to the collection of the €200 charge on non principal private residences has also been introduced, with around 80% of payments in respect of this charge being made online.While the local government sector will now be working with the newly-established National Public Procurement Operations Unit (NPPOU) to maximise efficiencies in procurement, local authorities have also undertaken significant work to promote greater efficiency in the area of procurement.  An online annual quotation solution (www.laquotes.ie) for local authorities has been established, which accepts quotations from suppliers for a range of goods and services.  In addition, on a regional level, local authorities are combining to procure and purchase services.  Further work will be undertaken to increase aggregated purchasing as a means of achieving volume savings across the sector on a range of supplies and products.E-government has been an important focus of attention in the local government sector to date and the emphasis now is on building on early initiatives, such as online payment services (e.g. parking fines, bin tags and housing rents), online motor tax and online access to planning application documents, to ensure optimal ease of access and efficiency for the public.  Extending these initiatives to other local authorities and new areas will be important.I also intend to advance the White Paper on Local Government later this year following, in particular, Government consideration of local government financing in light of the Report of the Commission on Taxation and the commitments included in the renewed Programme for Government.

To address this, the Authority is taking steps to reduce expenditure with the aim of achieving a break even position as soon as possible. While the level of new economic activity in the area has declined in recent times, the Authority will continue to focus on its core objectives and manage existing programmes and projects.

An evaluation was made on the basis of circumstances, or a combination of circumstances, which might result in Dublin City Council not being in a position to meet the volumetric contractual commitment which forms part of the public private partnership agreement in respect of the facility and thus being required to meet the cost of the capacity not then being availed of.The projection was based on an assumed shortfall of 180ktpa and an assumed penalty of €100 per tonne to arrive at a potential exposure of €18m per annum assuming that the shortfall continued indefinitely and/or it proved impossible to re-negotiate the provision in the agreement or sell-on some or all of the capacity to a third party at a rate which might offset in whole or in part the liability which would have arisen.

This Sub-Programme, which includes the management of water supply systems, active leakage control and mains rehabilitation, has been in progress for a number of years and has led to reductions in unaccounted for water, improved knowledge of the condition of water distribution networks and consumption patterns and an improvement in the level and quality of supply to consumers.The water conservation allocations, together with details of all major water services schemes, for each local authority are set out in the Water Services Investment Programme 2007–2009 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.   Additional information in relation to progress on individual contracts or water conservation works under the Programme may be obtained from the relevant local authority.The priority to be accorded to water services schemes, including water conservation projects, is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authority concerned.   Last July, local authorities were asked to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services in their areas to my Department by 23 October last.    My Department has begun its consideration of those needs assessments, which will form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme.Water conservation has to be a key component of local authority water services operations and I am determined that water conservation projects will be more fully integrated into the new Programme.  To that end, in conducting their needs assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria, with water conservation projects that meet environmental and economic goals being listed as a priority category.  The 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme will be published in early 2010.

The charge, which is set at €200 per annum, is payable by owners of private rented accommodation, holiday homes and any other residential property that is not the owner's sole of main residence.Section 4(6) of the Local Government (Charges) Act provides for an exemption from the charge in a situation where a relative of the owner is living rent-free in a property, a long as that property is no more than two kilometres from the owner's residence.  The intention behind this provision was principally to cater for a situation where accommodation would be provided for an elderly parent by a son or daughter in order that the parent concerned could retain a measure of independent living for as long as possible.   The two kilometres provision is not arbitrary but follows precedent from the Revenue Commissioners' legislation dealing with the home carer tax credit.  I have no plans to amend this provision.While the Act is silent on how the two kilometres might be measured, interpretation and implementation of the legislation is a matter for the local authorities in the first instance.

We have recently seen further increases in recycling rates in Dublin, with a corresponding drop in residual waste volumes. The IWMA report would appear to support that analysis.It is important to note that the recommendations of the Eunomia Consultancy report, which I published last week, would have the effect of further reducing the volumes of residual waste generated and driving more waste towards recycling. I intend to develop a new policy statement on waste management, which I shall bring to Government as soon as possible in 2010, arising from the recommendations in the report.

Local jarveys use the park to ply their trade for financial gain.The horse dung on the roads in the park is unsightly and smelly and is at odds with the national park ethos, conflicts with the beautiful landscape and is unattractive to tourists.  It is also a health and safety issue.NPWS has engaged in a lengthy consultation process with the jarveys, over two years, on controlling dung in the park.  This has involved consideration of various options including the use of a dungcatcher device.  A process of practical trialling dungcatcher devices on various terrains with different horses has been carried out and a number of demonstrations have been provided to the jarveys.  These demonstrations which were backed up by expert equine, veterinary and animal welfare advice show that dungcatchers do work and are safe to use.  The devices are used successfully in many countries across the world and there is no evidence that they cause difficulties.  They are being offered to the jarveys free of charge.  Recently, following a High Court case on this matter, which affirmed the NPWS right to manage the park, NPWS sought to move the issue forward by agreeing to appoint an independent person to facilitate the introduction of the device.  Unfortunately, the jarveys would not engage with this person.Having regard to the position outlined above, it is regrettable that the jarveys have effectively chosen to exclude themselves from the park.  A minority group have placed pickets at the Muckross House gate entrance.I am satisfied that NPWS has been reasonable and patient in its approach with the jarveys.  While I am happy for the jarveys to use the park, such use must carry some responsibility and requires respect for other users. I hope that the jarveys will work with the NPWS for the benefit of all.  On 20 November, NPWS again wrote to each jarvey asking if they would consider using the opportunity of this quiet tourism period, to try out the device at a time and a place that suits themselves.  In addition, NPWS would again be willing to re-constitute an independent facilitation process to progress the matter and address issues that might arise during trialling. NPWS has prepared a DVD which has been offered with the dungcatcher, also free of charge, showing how to fit the device so it can be tried by the jarveys at their convenience.

The purpose of this review is to consider whether the Act best supports the PRTB's key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  I recently announced the preliminary results of this review, which make recommendations in a number of key areas and have an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act and reducing delays.  While a range of issues still remain to be considered, I intend to initiate a comprehensive piece of amending legislation within the next 12 months.  Among the main issues that will be addressed by the amending legislation are—A statutory objective of six months to be set for the issuing of determination orders arising out of dispute resolution applications,The Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members,The introduction of fixed fines where deposits are illegally retained by landlords,Measures to address non-payment of rent by tenants during a dispute process, in particular to introduce scope for the legal termination of such a tenancy,The separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board,The inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel the current remit of the RTA.A number of issues requiring further research, including third party complaints under the Act, the Act's engagement with anti-social behaviour matters and how best to address issues surrounding the retention of deposits, will also be considered in detail. In addition, all opportunities for the introduction of time and procedural efficiencies in the Act will be examined.  My Department has begun work on the necessary revisions to the Residential Tenancies Act with the intention of have the legislation prepared before the end of 2010.  Full details in relation to the background to the review and the associated terms of reference are available on my Department's website,  www.environ.ie.
The PRTB, which commenced operations in September 2004, is at present outside the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  Given the importance of openness and transparency in relation to the operation of State bodies generally it is my intention that the Board, subject to exemptions that recognise its quasi-judicial functions, should come under the scope of the Freedom of Information legislation.  I will be seeking to give effect to this in the context of the next set of proposals for the extension of the Freedom of Information Act to additional public bodies, to be brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for the Freedom of Information legislative code.

In addition, by 2020, Ireland is committed under the EU climate and energy package agreed in December 2008 to achieve a 20% reduction on 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme.  This 20% target is binding in EU law, as will any adjustment to it in the light of the outcome to the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December 2009.The EPA is responsible for emission projections.  Its most recent analysis based on the ESRI's Economic Shock scenario indicates a distance to target for the Kyoto period 2008-2012 in the range of 1.3 -1.8 million tonnes per annum.  Based on these figures and with full implementation of all announced emission reduction measures, the purchasing requirement to ensure Kyoto compliance would be between 6.5 and 9 million carbon credits.Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency has been designated as purchasing agent for carbon credits for the State.  To date the agency has purchased 5.255 million credits.  In addition, investments made by my Department in Carbon Funds operated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank are expected to yield some 3 million credits during the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012.In the current economic climate an unusually high degree of uncertainty attaches to all projections.  It is now clear that the economic contraction will be deeper than assumed in the ESRI's scenario.  It is quite possible that Ireland will now meet its Kyoto target for the non-trading sector without using carbon credits.  In the circumstances, the National Treasury Management Agency has been asked to put its purchasing programme on hold for the foreseeable future.  Purchasing requirements to ensure Kyoto compliance are being kept under review and will be revised as necessary in the light of future projections.  If it transpires that more credits have been bought than are needed they can be carried forward for use after 2012 in the next commitment period.

The following table lists the directives involved and indicates the various stages of proceedings in respect of these cases.The Commission made a decision on 29 October 2009 to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for an imposition of fines in relation to the directive on the quality required of shellfish waters, while deferring such referral for three months.  Ireland has never been fined by the EU for an environmental infringement and I am confident that all outstanding aspects of this case will be completed to the satisfaction of the Commission within the timescale allowed for addressing the outstanding issues.EU Instrument Number and General ReferenceArticle 226 Letter of Formal NoticeArticle 226 Reasoned OpinionBeing Referred to the European Court of JusticeBefore the European Court of Justice for a hearing or awaiting judgementEuropean Court of Justice Decision to be ImplementedArticle 228 Letter of Formal NoticeArticle 228 Reasoned OpinionTotal75/442/EEC the waste directive2000110476/464/EEC on dangerous substances in water0000001179/409/EEC on wild birds1000001279/923/EEC on the quality required of shellfish waters0000001180/68/EEC on groundwater0000010180/778/EEC on the quality of drinking water for human consumption0000001185/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment1001020491/271/EEC on urban waste water treatment0001100292/43/EEC on habitats0010011396/61/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control1000000198/81/EC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms1000000199/31/EC on landfill010000012000/53/EC on end of life vehicles100000012000/60/EC the water framework directive100000012002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment100000012001/42/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment010000012003/35/EC on public participation in certain plans and programmes relating to the environment000010012006/21/EC on the management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC010000012006/118/EC on the protection of groundwater against pollution and deterioration010000012007/2/EC establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the EU — INSPIRE01000001Decision 2005/166/EC & Decision 280/2004/EC: Rules concerning a mechanism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions and for implementing the Kyoto Protocol10000001Total Number at Each Stage1051235531

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	577	Meeting the requirements of the Landfill Directive is a key national priority in respect of waste management and I am committed to implementing the measures necessary to ensure that Ireland meets the 2010, and subsequent, EU landfill diversion targets.In the coming weeks, I will make regulations to bring an entirely new approach to the management of our food waste, which will take effect from next year.  The new regulations will require the source segregation and appropriate treatment of food waste arising from commercial premises.In addition, I intend to use the powers already available to me under the Waste Management Acts to increase the landfill levy by the currently permitted maximum of €5 per tonne before the end of the year and a further €5 in the early weeks of 2010.  This will bring the levy to €30 per tonne and begin to address the race to the bottom in landfill gate fees which we are now witnessing and which acts as a barrier to achieving the diversion targets.I shall also be publishing a Bill on levies generally where further substantial increases in the landfill levy will be made. The Bill will also address the extension of levies to other waste facilities.  Last year, my Department issued a circular to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins and promote the use of home composting and the EPA National Waste Report 2007 indicates increased quantities of biodegradable waste are being dealt with by home composting. I intend to issue a further circular to local authorities to accelerate progress in the roll out of brown bins and to further promote the benefits of home composting.I am confident that all of the above measures will contribute significantly to the achievement of the targets for the diversion of waste from landfill and a reduction in our overall use of such facilities.

Since then, a process has been put in place to address the issues that arise from the decision.  An interdepartmental task force, chaired by my Department, has been established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  To date, the task force has met twice, in July and November 2009, and it aims to complete its work as soon as possible.In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.  Detailed consideration of all relevant factors is under way to inform the manner in which disposal of the machines will be effected.  This includes contact with the original suppliers of the machines.Details in respect of costs incurred for the storage of electronic voting equipment are gathered annually by my Department from Returning Officers, in January each year.  Figures for storage costs in 2009 are therefore not yet available.  Based on figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating) for 2008 were some €204,000.

A provision of €500 million is available for investment in water services infrastructure in 2009. Expenditure to date in 2009 amounts to €442.6 million; the full year provision will be spent by year end.Capital investment in 2008 involved expenditure of €220 million on major wastewater infrastructure projects and €171 million on major water supply projects. 41 projects were completed during the year and 127 projects were in progress at the end of the year.  A further €105 million was spent on schemes in the Rural Water Programme, which is largely devolved to local authorities.Capital investment in 2009 to date has involved expenditure of €207 million on major wastewater infrastructure projects and €166 million on major water supply projects.  It is anticipated that some 40 projects will be completed this year and that some 120 projects will be in progress at year end.  A further €70 million has been spent to date on schemes in the Rural Water Programme.Progress is being made by local authorities on the provision of water services in their areas.  This has been assisted through the high levels of investment in recent years, together with new legislation on the supervision and enforcement of drinking water standards in public water supplies and the licensing of wastewater treatment plants.There is an ongoing need to expand and improve our water and wastewater treatment capacity to ensure compliance with EU judgements and other required environmental standards, to anticipate future economic and social development needs and to ensure investment decisions reflect other national priorities such as the National Spatial Strategy.  These issues have been central to the assessment of needs for water services infrastructure in their areas that I asked local authorities to undertake in recent months. These assessments will form the basis of projects to be included in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 — 2012, which is to be published early next year.In addition, my Department is currently undertaking a Value for Money Study in relation to the efficiency and effectiveness of delivery of the Water Services Investment Programme as part of the Government's Value for Money Reviews for 2009 — 2011.  The outcome of this study will also influence the implementation of future water services investment programmes.

Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).The European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 came into effect on 1 May 2007.  These Regulations transpose EU Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information.The process to transpose the Public Participation Directive is well advanced.  The recent European Court of Justice judgement in case C427/07 concerning the Public Participation Directive requires certain legislative amendments which my Department is prioritising in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  When this work has been completed I, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will ensure that the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention is submitted to Government and laid before the Dáil as a matter of urgency.  Ratification of the Aarhus Convention is a priority and the renewed Programme for Government commits the Government to its ratification by March 2010.

The establishment of this group is a matter for the OPW.The issue of a retaining sea wall or similar such barrier remains a key issue to be addressed in this context.  Consideration of a suitable mechanism to be put in place for ongoing dialogue with local communities to ensure that their requirements can be considered by the Government will also be pursued.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I understand the concerns of domestic turf cutters on the relatively small number of designated raised bogs on which, for conservation reasons, turf cutting needs to be ended.  There is no intention to restrict this activity on the vast majority of bogs within the State, where cutting may continue as before.  The restrictions on domestic turf cutting on designated raised bogs affect only about 4% of the total area of bogland available for cutting.  These restrictions are required for the State to fulfil its legal obligations to protect these sites under the EU Habitats Directive.Earlier this year, I established the interdepartmental working group on the cessation of turf cutting in designated areas to examine all the implications of cessation, not least the measures that need to be taken to meet the concerns of turf cutters affected by the cessation.  This group invited and received submissions from interested parties and has met with representatives of turf-cutting groups which made submissions, as well as with conservation interests.  All submissions received and views expressed, including proposed approaches and solutions, are being considered.The working group will report to me on the measures that may be required to implement the cessation, from the end of the year, on the first 32 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation.  These measures will include full consideration of the impact of any cessation on those who have relied on turf cutting in these bogs for their fuel supplies.

Any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances, require sanction from my Department.The number of local authority positions that have become vacant in 2008 and 2009 is not held by my Department.

In that context, it is expected that authorities would be able to secure lease costs of at least 20% below current market rent.In general, each lease agreement entered into will also be subject to periodic rent reviews.  Where reviews are provided for, my Department has advised authorities that reviews should follow market conditions, so that rent would be adjusted upwards or downwards as appropriate.  To ensure compliance with this, when submitting proposals authorities are required to provide details of the rent reviews agreed.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission which will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight, implement modern and efficient electoral practices, revise constituency boundaries, take charge of compiling a new national rolling Electoral Register, take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission relating to election spending and examine the issue of financing the political system.The renewed programme for Government, agreed in October 2009, reaffirms this commitment and states that an independent Electoral Commission will incorporate the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission, with enhanced powers of inspection.  The renewed programme sets out the following responsibilities which the Commission will be mandated to fulfil: to decide the constituency boundaries; administer the voting registration process; run voter education programmes; advise on mechanisms to increase the participation of women in political life, including the use of additional criteria for public funding which encourages more women and lesser represented groups; and recommend revised guidelines on the declaration of donations for political purposes.In addition, the renewed programme states that, within 12 months, the Commission will also propose reforms to the electoral system, including:make recommendations on the feasibility of extending the franchise for Presidential Elections to the Irish abroad;examine and make recommendations for changes to the electoral system for Dáil elections, including the number of deputies and their means of elections;outline new electoral systems for Seanad Éireann;advise on the basis for European elections to reflect new realities of the role and influence of the European Parliament, including consideration of moving towards one national constituency and using a list system;make recommendations on the possibility of extending the franchise for local elections to those aged 16 or over;set minimum standards for the taking and publication of political polls within the state to ensure fairness and accuracy, and;consider options for the timing of elections for Local Authorities, the Dáil, Seanad and European Parliament.  This should include the possibility of ‘mid-term' elections and running some elections on a ‘staggered' or ‘rolled' basis so that elections do not fall on the same day for every candidate or chamber.In implementing the commitments as set out in the 2007 programme for Government, and to assist in consideration of the issues involved, I commissioned a report by an expert group from University College Dublin.  I published the report, entitled A Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland, for consultation in February 2009.  The report is available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie. Written submissions received to date as part of the consultation process are currently being considered.  While the formal closing date for written submissions has passed, I will still welcome and consider any views and observations that are put forward by interested individuals and organisations.In developing and bringing forward proposals for the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission, based on the commitments contained in the programme for Government and the renewed  programme for Government, I will take into account the report prepared by the UCD group and views put forward as part of the consultation process.

The extension of the leasing arrangements to the voluntary and co-operative housing sector is designed further to broaden the sources of supply and accelerate delivery under the initiative.The new arrangements put in place mean that approved housing bodies will now be able to procure units themselves, either directly from a private owner or by purchasing/constructing units using private finance, which they then make available under the leasing programme to persons in need of social housing support.  The lease payment, in both cases, will be equivalent to what would be paid under the other leasing delivery mechanisms, as payments will again be determined by reference to local market rents.The assessment process in place for units provided by approved housing bodies will be similar to that already in place for leasing proposals generally.  In each case, the approved housing body will need to demonstrate that there is a housing need in the area concerned and that the proposal complies with the Department's sustainable communities policy objective and represents good value for money.  Provision is also made for the involvement of the relevant housing authority at various stages of the assessment process and in relation to the implementation of proposals.

Table 2 contains monthly live register data for each county, while Table 3 gives corresponding information for local social welfare offices in Dublin for December 2007, December 2008 and January to October 2009.Q4 2007-Q2 2009 by regionQ4 2007In Employment ’000Unemployed ’000In Labour Force ’000Unemployment Rate %Age 15-24MaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalBorder19.115.034.02.01.53.521.116.537.59.69.09.3Midland9.98.518.41.2*1.811.29.020.211.15.78.7West16.315.431.71.21.22.417.516.634.16.97.37.1Dublin48.648.597.14.83.48.253.451.9105.39.06.57.8Mid-East17.116.533.51.7*2.318.817.135.99.23.56.5Mid-West12.210.222.31.91.53.414.111.725.713.512.713.2South-East18.515.133.72.01.43.520.616.637.19.88.79.3South-West22.819.542.22.21.33.625.020.845.88.96.47.8State164.3148.6313.017.211.528.6181.5160.1341.69.57.28.4Q1 2008In Employment ’000Unemployed ’000In Labour Force ’000Unemployment Rate %Age 15-24MaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalBorder18.514.232.72.5*3.321.015.136.111.85.89.3Midland9.18.217.31.6*1.910.88.419.215.03.29.8West14.013.927.92.51.94.316.515.732.215.011.813.4Dublin44.446.590.95.43.38.749.849.899.610.96.78.8Mid-East16.814.030.81.6*2.118.414.532.98.83.26.4Mid-West11.910.322.21.71.12.813.711.425.112.89.711.4South-East17.015.432.42.31.43.619.316.736.011.78.210.1South-West20.619.139.72.51.23.723.120.343.410.95.88.5State152.3141.6293.820.110.430.6172.4152.0324.411.76.99.4Q2 2008In Employment ’000Unemployed ’000In Labour Force ’000Unemployment Rate %Age 15-24MaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalBorder17.113.730.83.81.75.520.915.536.418.211.215.2Midland8.37.415.72.0*2.810.38.318.619.210.515.3West13.613.226.92.62.85.316.216.032.215.817.316.6Dublin42.545.187.65.73.39.048.248.496.611.86.89.3Mid-East16.115.131.22.81.54.318.916.635.414.69.012.0Mid-West12.310.723.02.71.34.015.012.127.017.811.114.8South-East17.315.933.23.21.85.020.517.738.215.410.313.0South-West20.218.738.93.21.85.023.320.543.813.58.711.3State147.5139.9287.425.815.140.9173.3155.0328.314.99.812.5Q3 2008In Employment ’000Unemployed ’000In Labour Force ’000Unemployment Rate %Age 15-24MaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalBorder15.314.930.24.22.26.419.517.136.621.412.817.4Midland9.38.818.12.11.63.711.410.421.818.415.216.8West14.613.528.12.82.75.617.516.233.716.216.816.5Dublin43.741.885.68.36.314.652.048.2100.215.913.114.6Mid-East14.515.429.83.11.34.517.616.734.317.88.013.0Mid-West12.510.322.73.02.05.015.512.327.719.516.018.0South-East16.816.132.93.72.46.120.518.539.018.212.815.7South-West22.321.343.64.22.76.926.524.050.515.711.413.7State149.0142.1291.131.421.252.6180.4163.3343.717.413.015.3Q4 2008In Employment ’000Unemployed ’000In Labour Force ’000Unemployment Rate %Age 15-24MaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalBorder13.912.926.84.31.55.918.214.532.723.710.617.9Midland6.86.613.52.1*2.98.97.416.423.810.717.8West11.013.224.33.92.96.814.916.231.125.918.221.9Dublin36.139.575.68.14.112.244.243.687.818.39.413.9Mid-East13.313.626.92.51.03.415.814.630.415.66.711.3Mid-West10.79.520.23.61.75.314.311.125.425.214.920.7South-East13.413.426.83.82.96.717.316.333.522.217.720.0South-West15.816.532.33.31.44.719.217.937.017.47.712.8State121.1125.3246.431.616.347.9152.7141.6294.220.711.516.3Q1 2009In Employment ’000Unemployed ’000In Labour Force ’000Unemployment Rate %Age 15-24MaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalBorder11.210.121.35.42.37.716.612.429.032.418.526.5Midland5.86.512.32.5*3.38.37.415.630.511.121.4West9.613.122.73.02.96.012.616.028.624.018.320.8Dublin33.438.471.89.23.412.742.641.884.421.68.215.0Mid-East10.414.024.43.61.95.514.015.929.925.812.018.4Mid-West9.17.516.63.41.75.112.49.221.727.018.623.4South-East11.712.624.34.93.07.816.515.632.129.419.024.4South-West14.616.531.14.21.75.918.818.237.022.29.516.0State105.7118.6224.336.117.853.9141.8136.4278.325.513.019.4Q2 2009In Employment ’000Unemployed ’000In Labour Force ’000Unemployment Rate %Age 15-24MaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalBorder10.010.220.26.93.09.916.913.230.140.822.732.9Midland6.26.012.23.11.84.89.27.817.033.222.828.4West10.212.222.44.43.37.714.615.530.130.321.125.6Dublin28.435.764.210.96.117.039.441.881.227.814.621.0Mid-East10.212.322.55.42.68.015.714.930.534.817.226.2Mid-West8.58.016.44.02.96.912.510.923.332.126.629.6South-East11.112.423.57.13.710.818.216.134.339.023.031.5South-West14.416.130.55.63.38.920.019.439.427.817.222.6State99.0112.9211.947.526.674.1146.5139.5286.032.419.125.9Figures marked with a * refer to estimates of below 1,000 persons.

Printing costs incurred by my Department amounted to €256,969 in 2008 and €70,480 in 2009.  This includes publications where the Department is required to publish the text in the Irish language to meet obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003.  However, as it is usual to print the Irish and English text within the same cover, it is not possible to separately identify the cost of printing publications in Irish.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The Government is well aware of the affect that the economic downturn has had on the construction sector and those working in it and has therefore provided a range of labour force measures that will support this particular sector in these difficult times.As part of the strategy to tackle unemployment, FÁS has put in place measures to double the capacity to cater for the rise in referrals from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The implementation of these measures has increased the annual referral capacity to 147,000 persons in 2009.  Additionally, this year the Tánaiste has almost doubled the number of training and activation work experience places provided by FÁS to over 130,000, which will allow for the retraining and upskilling for amongst others, those individuals previously employed in the construction sector.As a way of targeting construction workers, FÁS offers green energy and environmental training programmes, which are aimed primarily at redundant construction workers.  These programmes are directed towards emerging fields such as renewable energy and sustainable energy, and aim to provide construction workers with the necessary skills in these growth areas.In relation to redundant apprentices, significant resources have been made available to ensure that combined with existing initiatives, approximately 4,000 redundant apprentices will be able to progress their apprenticeships or receive training.  Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses, which are trade related to enhance their employable skills.  They may also avail of the range of trade related night courses, which are available in FÁS training centres.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	595	In the context of the commitment contained in Building Ireland’s Smart Economy  document to “publish a whole-of-government response to recommendations contained in Competition Authority reports within nine months of their publication”, a prioritised list of Competition Authority recommendations, based on their impact on competitiveness, was drawn up by my Department earlier this year.  Recommendations contained in the National Competitiveness Council’s Annual Competitiveness Report and various OECD reports also contributed to this list of recommendations.  I have received the views of the relevant Government Ministers on how these recommendations, in so far as they relate to their departments, can be progressed and I intend to bring an update to Government shortly on the progress achieved to date.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	596	In response to the economic downturn and the resulting rapid rise in unemployment, FÁS has, within its existing staff allocation, increased the number of staff in front line Employment Services.  The totality of people interviewed has expanded considerably and it was essential that FÁS provided enough front-line staff in the National Employment Service to provide for a major increase in NEAP referrals from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2009.  This was achieved largely through the voluntary redeployment of staff from other areas of FÁS to Employment Services. Appropriate training and development has been arranged for these staff to equip them for their new responsibilities.In addition FÁS has agreed with the Local Employment Service that it will provide a large-scale direct referral capacity for NEAP clients.  This process commenced early in 2009 and there is currently a capacity for approximately 38,000 NEAP interview slots per year throughout the LES network.  This brings the total FÁS/LES NEAP capacity to 147,000.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	598	The National Training Fund is used as a dedicated fund to support the training and upskilling of those in employment and those who wish to take up employment.  It is also used as a fund for research to provide information on existing and likely future skills requirements of the economy.In 2009 the National Training Fund is investing a total of €381.4 million in training and upskilling.  This includes financial support for the Finuas Training Networks Programme launched by the Tánaiste in February 2009 and delivered through Skillnets Limited to provide targeted specialist training to those working in the international financial services industry as identified in the Smart Economy Report.  It also includes support to the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), which advises the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy and on other labour market issues that impact on Ireland's enterprise and employment growth.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	599	In December 2008, the Government reinforced the importance of the investment in the commercialisation of publicly funded research in ’Building Ireland’s Smart Economy — A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal’, and tasked enterprise agencies Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, with the job of instilling a commercialisation culture in the enterprise sector and third-level institutions.  It is essential that Ireland’s research community is motivated and well resourced to deliver the cutting-edge products and services that can be integrated into existing companies to give them competitive advantage, or form the basis of a new company, thereby creating exports and employment.  In 2009 Enterprise Ireland launched the Business Partners Programme, a pilot scheme for engaging entrepreneurs with the research commercialisation projects in the Irish research system that are close to being ready for commercialisation.  The purpose of the scheme is to bring selected research commercialisation projects to the point where they are "spin out", or company, "start up ready".  The scheme is providing the Enterprise Ireland commercialisation activities with a novel key resource in driving increased delivery on the targets for High Potential Start-Up companies from state funded research.Enterprise Ireland's communications strategy for 2009 included a number of events and publications designed to motivate academic researchers to commercialise their research and to increase public awareness of the economic and societal benefits of the commercialisation of academic research, from commercialisation forums to new commercialisation web and "bloging" initiatives to research technology showcases where researchers displayed their technology to industry.  The evidence is that this message is being heard.  In a survey of third level researchers conducted in October 2009 78% of respondents stated that they would now like to commercialise their research; this shows an increase of 17% from 2008.To date over 100 companies have been spun out from funded research in the third level system.  These companies have a combined annual turnover of €160 million and €13 7 million in exports and employ over 1000 people.  In 2009 Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA developed programmes and supports to further drive the commercial return on the State's research investment through direct funding and advice to researchers to commercialise their research and supports to institutions to help build the commercialisation system.In early 2009 Science Foundation Ireland set as itself a strategy to significantly enhance its focus on the relationship between scientific research and the current and future competitiveness of Irish industry.  To this end SFI has set targets for collaborating with enterprise, generation of spin out companies, production of high quality research output and personnel.  Some examples of the actions taken to date to assist with the commercialisation culture are:Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland have been working together to realise the commercial potential arising from SFI funded programmes.  In 2009 an initiative focused on the commercialisation of research funded under the Centres for Science, Engineering and Technology (CSET) programme aims to accelerate the realisation of national economic benefits from the CSET programme through active commercialisation of research outputs.In the July 2009 call for proposals for the Energy SRC Programme there is a requirement to ensure that industry shares in the cost of the investmentSFI now carries out an annual census of outputs and impacts which shows that (in 2008) SFI funded projects have collaborations with 311 companies, 170 of which are multinational companies, 108 are small/medium enterprises as well as and 33 other companies.a Head of Industry Research Development has been appointed by SFI to ensure that prospects for industry-academic collaboration and commercialisation of research opportunities are realised;Enterprise Ireland offers a suite of supports to academics to commercialise their research and supports to institutions to help build the commercialisation system.  These include supports for effective Technology Transfer Offices in Universities, commercially relevant research centres in Institutes of Technology and Campus Incubation facilities to support new technology companies in their formative years. This programme to realise the commercial potential of Ireland’s research community is supported in 2009 by a projected level of investment of €36 million.  To date in 2009 the Enterprise Ireland supported Technology Transfer Offices facilitated the creation of 20 start-up companies, 339 invention disclosures, 97 priority patents filed and 47 technology licence transfers between companies.Further, in an effort to instil appropriate attitudes from the start, my Department funds the Discover Science and Engineering programme to encourage more students to take up careers in the physical sciences and in engineering.  Through programmes of support for the science curriculum at primary and second levels, the Discover Science and Engineering programme seeks to encourage students to take an interest in science and engineering and subsequently to study those subjects at third and fourth level and in time become the entrepreneurs of the future.

In addition to new and emerging markets the action plan will also focus on our key markets for trade, investment and tourism, namely the UK, the Eurozone and the US.The action plan will build on the points set out in the Smart Economy Framework, as well as on the relevant recommendations from the Farmleigh Forum.  It is not possible at this stage to give an exact date for anticipated completion of this work and publication of the plan, although significant progress will have been made by the end of the year, with an expected final draft to be presented to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal very early in the new year.With regard to the review of Ireland's network of Missions abroad, this is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I understand that this review is ongoing and will ensure that the Missions are operating at an optimum level of efficiency, are delivering tangible services and outcomes for the benefit of Ireland and its citizens and that resources are aligned with our strategic objectives.This review is all the more important in the light of current budgetary pressures.  In carrying out the review, full account is being taken of both the operational and reputational costs to the State and assessing the potential financial implications of either Embassy openings or closures.The Government's objective, to the greatest extent possible and within the limits of available resources, is to maintain the capability of Ireland's diplomatic and Enterprise Development Agency network overseas, in order to promote our key objectives abroad, particularly support for our economic recovery.

The revised criteria will come into effect from the 1st December and the key changes are the following: § The duration of the work placement has been increased to a maximum of 9 months.Recipients of most social welfare payments, including Job Seekers' Allowance and Job Seekers' Benefit, will now be eligible to apply. Unemployed graduates who are not receiving a social welfare payment will also now be eligible to apply.2009 graduates are now also eligible to apply.The period, for which participants have to be in receipt of a social welfare payment in order to be eligible, has been reduced from six months to three months.The Programme will be open to all sectors of the economy including, the private sector, the public sector and the community/voluntary sector.The requirement for a firm to have at least ten employees has been removed.Previously firms could only participate if they did not have redundancies in the previous six months.  This constraint has been reduced to three months.Individuals interested in the programme need only to visit their local FÁS office, who will check their eligibility and register their interest in the programme.  They are then provided with contact details of Providers to apply for any placements in which they have an interest.  They will also be notified of any new placements that arise that may suit their skills set.Prospective Providers, can download an application form and e-mail it to FÁS or they can ring 1800 611 116 to request that a form be posted to them.FÁS has just completed a promotional campaign on regional radio and newspapers to promote the Work Placement Programme and advertisements for the Programme have also been placed in several Business Magazine titles that are due to be published this month.

In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow. Priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc), construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.As detailed above, not all projects fall within the CEB eligibility criteria for grant assistance, however, in order to more fully explore the range of options that may be available to them the company are advised to contact their local CEB to discuss their business needs with the relevant staff of the Board.  Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website: www.enterpriseboards.ie.

In general, all buildings and premises occupied by my Department and its Offices are provided by the Office of Public Works (OPW) without any cost to the Department, in many of those cases the buildings/ premises are rented or leased by the OPW and the information requested by the Deputy could only be supplied by the OPW.NERA's Shannon accommodation is held under a four-year licence agreement between the OPW and NERA on the one hand and Westpark Shannon Limited on the other. The licence fee amounts to €156.08 per square metre, subject to a maximum charge of €32,480 per annum (exclusive of VAT).  The OPW will assume responsibility, with effect from 1 January 2010 for the payment of the licence fee costs.  NERA has indicated that there are no plans for a review of this licence arrangement at this time. The licence agreement itself provides for a review every four years.  The first review will take place in March 2013.  NERA has also indicated that it is satisfied that it secured a very competitive rate when leasing its office accommodation in Shannon, in co-operation with the OPW, and that a review at this time is not justified.

Should an individual feel that they have been unfairly dismissed by reason of unfair selection for redundancy, it is open to that individual to take a case to the Rights Commissioners or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 2007 generally apply to any employee who has 12 months continuous service with the employer. In the case of a complaint referred to a Rights Commissioner, the employer may object and in that event the matter will be heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  If the employee has any further queries in this regard, they may contact the National Employment Rights Authority on their Lo-call number 1890 80 80 90 or via their website at www.employmentrights.ieIDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland established a team to market the operation internationally through their overseas office network and received over 16 expressions of interest in the facility. The team contacted the companies to evaluate their level of interest in the operation and to encourage them to put forward investment proposals to take over all or part of the operation.Also, SR Technics received over 30 expressions of interest in the operation and received five bids from interested parties for parts of the business and carried out their assessment on those bids.  I understand that SR Technics considered that the bids received were well below their assessment of the market value of the assets.Subsequently, SR Technics reached a provisional agreement with a bidder for the sale of the APU and Landing Gear assets. However the bidder planned to remove the assets from the country, which would have had a terminal effect on the continuation of an MRO business in Dublin.Following my intervention,  the decision was reversed by SR Technics.  Subsequently, a bid from Dublin Aerospace Limited, an Irish based company,  for the APU and Landing Gear assets was accepted.On 2nd September,  I announced the establishment of Dublin Aerospace Ltd — a new aviation maintenance provider at Dublin Airport which is planned to provide 226 jobs within five years with the support of the Government through Enterprise Ireland.Dublin Aerospace aims to establish a best-in-class Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility at Dublin Airport, servicing APUs, Landing Gear, Base Maintenance and Training.The Garage business unit of SR Technics has been taken over by the M50 Truck and Van Centre who were successful in securing the airside vehicle maintenance contract from SR Technics.I understand that SR Technics will continue to operate the Line Maintenance contract for Aer Lingus until a suitable acceptable operator is agreed between both companies.

These responsibilities include:Oversight of over 1300 community schemes involving over 24,000 people;The operation of 70 Employment Services Offices assisting in excess of 150,000 unemployed people;Providing over 120,000 training opportunities to unemployed people;Providing training and other services to 22,000 apprentices;Supporting a wide range of other services to disadvantaged people in our society.By the end of 2009 management grades in FÁS will have reduced by over 10% overall and by 20% in the senior management grade from its peak.The pay increases referred to by the Deputy were in line with national agreements and pay movements generally.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	613	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received an application for a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on 5 November, 2009 in respect of the person concerned which is awaiting processing.Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed on-line is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing applications filed on-line from April 2009 and those submitted by post from March 2009.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements as in this case, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims for the first ten months of 2009 at 67,207.  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 51.5 although the Section is currently carrying two vacant positions which are due to be filled;the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.

In the absence of this, the employee is advised by the Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.It is the case that at this point, a number of former employees of the company have been paid out their redundancy entitlements by my Department since June 2009 on the basis of determinations received from the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I understand that the individual, who is the subject of the Deputy's query, was advised by my Department to take a case to the EAT for a determination.  However, this interaction with my Department crossed with the submission of the outstanding supporting documentation on behalf of the former employer.  In this instance, there is no longer a need for the individual to pursue her case before the EAT and I confirm that payment of her claim will be made within the next one to two weeks.

While such approval is imminent, the setting up of additional promotional and information services is not opportune at this point. However, all eligible redundant workers will be contacted directly as to the supports available under the Fund in due course.Considerable work has already been done and structures are in place to ensure that EGF funding, when received by Ireland, can and will be effectively and efficiently spent on retraining, upskilling and providing educational and entrepreneurial supports for almost 2,500 redundant workers in the Mid West.In the interim, FÁS and other relevant bodies such as Enterprise Ireland, City and County Enterprise Boards and the local Vocational Education Committees continue to make their full range of employment, training, guidance, information and advisory services available to the redundant workers concerned.As regards the Mid-West Task Force, the wide range of recommendations in the report cover both local and national issues.  In that respect, the Government has been responding to the economic downturn generally and has taken numerous initiatives, for example in relation to competitiveness and cost competitiveness, industrial employment stabilization, and employment activation measures. All of these measures have benefited regions affected by or threatened with job losses, including the Mid West region. Workers in the Mid West are the subject of a substantial package assembled by the Government in response to the redundancies arising from developments at Dell in Limerick and knock-on effects in other companies in the region.In addition to the measures mentioned above, the state agencies IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the County Enterprise Boards have redoubled their efforts to stimulate industrial employment in the Mid West region. For example, IDA is supporting eight industrial projects with a job potential of 1,073 which were announced by multinational companies in the Mid West in 2008 and 2009 and are now being brought into operation.The measures mentioned above are outlined more fully in an initial response to its recommendations which I sent to the Task Force in late September. Given the wide range of recommendations in the report, I have also brought the report to the attention of my colleagues in Cabinet and it is currently being further considered in a number of other Government Departments as well as in my own Department. Ministers will, in the context of finalising their spending proposals for 2010, consider what further measures can be taken in response to the Task Force recommendations, including, as regards the Limerick Regeneration Programme.I am very grateful for the work Mr. Brosnan and the other members of the Task Force have undertaken to date. I shall continue to keep the Task Force informed on the Government's work on matters covered in the interim recommendations. The Task Force has identified a number of issues for further study in its Final Report which I look forward to receiving early in 2010.

My Department is charged with leading the cross-Government drive to reduce administrative burdens on business.  This is being done in a prioritised way, drawing from the experience of other Member States involved in administrative burden reduction.  Departments are currently identifying the "information obligations", contained in their legislation that are likely to be causing the biggest burdens for business.Once identified, these priority information obligations will be measured and following this simplification plans will be developed detailing how reductions may be carried out. Work is well advanced in my Department in the measurement of information obligations arising from Company Law, Employment Law and Health and Safety Law.  34 priority information obligations have been identified across these three areas. These were identified through consultation with business groups and experts, and by comparison with the results of the measurement undertaken in the United Kingdom.  It is envisaged that the measurement of these will be complete by the end of 2009.Other Departments are now listing and prioritising information contained in legislation under their responsibility.  Measurement of priorities identified across Government will be carried out during 2010. Once this phase is concluded, simplification plans will be developed.  Following this, simplification will be carried out during 2011 and 2012.

Expert appointments have been made in London, Dublin and two Gulf States to work with companies in the sector.  Enterprise Ireland is working with the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland (RIAI), the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland (ACEI), the Construction Industry Federation, and IBEC to develop services and supports to companies to enable them to succeed in entering these new markets.In addition, there have also been construction specific missions led by Enterprise Ireland to Russia, Poland, Romania, Saudi and the Gulf States.Arising from this activity, Enterprise Ireland has registered a significant increase in the number of new construction clients and has approved grant assistance to 100 clients from this sector to explore new markets.  Many of Enterprise Ireland's clients have registered on the London Olympics tender site.Construction clients have also benefited significantly from the recently introduced Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, which supports companies through immediate cash flow and financing difficulties and also supports them with market development costs.  As part of the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, a specific mechanism was established to support the construction professional services firms to fund their market development costs which are targeted in the main at markets in the Middle East and North Africa.There are 30 construction clients on the Leadership for Growth initiative, which was successfully completed in October of this year.  Their participation in the Leadership for Growth initiative has led to the formation of various formal and informal consortia to pursue business opportunities.Enterprise Ireland has also approved funding for the Construction Technology Industry Association, which is preparing an application for industry-led research support.

The financial services portfolio of IDA is a sub-set of this overall industry and comprises 150 companies, employing approximately 20,000 people.Following on from the financial turmoil which occurred in the later months of 2008, IDA undertook extensive marketing programmes in 2009 to bolster Ireland's image abroad and to ensure the key financial services centres of London, New York and Frankfurt were aware that Ireland was still an excellent location to house and run financial services operation.Overall, IDA business in 2009 is holding up with a good mix in of quality prospects spread across the three areas of Banking, Insurance and Investment Management.IDA has placed experienced people in the key markets to funnel through investment prospects from Europe, the US and elsewhere.IDA's innovation-focused overseas marketing campaign launched in the US in October, designed to position Ireland as the pre-eminent location for business to invest in future innovation, is working well and will form the key component of our marketing programmes worldwide in 2010.IDA is confident that employment in overseas financial services companies will remain at 20,000 as we enter the New Year. The Agency has a strong pipeline of new business propositions which it is expected will start to come on stream in the first half of 2010 thus ensuring that Ireland remains among the key locations for this sector in Europe.

During 2009, funding for programmes of  R&D activity in enterprise is projected to reach an investment level of €61m for companies,  representing an increase of approximately 13% on 2008.Enterprise Ireland also operates a range of supports to help companies to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company. This can range from initial small-scale collaborations to larger collaborative research projects involving groups of companies.  These supports include the popular Innovation Vouchers which provides up to €5,000 for an individual item of research. To mid-November 2009 360 Innovation Vouchers have been redeemed — 75% more than in the year 2008. Further, Enterprise Ireland's Campus Incubation Programme also supports over 230 new companies located in Business Incubation Centres employing over 1,000 people. In addition, the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Centres provides support and a location for 735 companies employing over 3,600 people.A stream of Industry Led Research Programmes is also providing an increased level of support in 2009 with a budgeted €29m investment. Under this category of supports the new EI/IDA Competence Centre initiative allow industry groups to set a commercial and industry-led research agenda which will be delivered on through collaboration with academics in the higher education sector.Complementary to the supports provided through Enterprise Ireland, my Department is also providing significant funding of  €165.4m in 2009 to Science foundation Ireland which will enable it to support 29 world-class research centres across the Irish universities and Institutes of Technology. Currently over 125 leading multi-nationals and indigenous firms are formally connected to these SFI funded centres with many more having informal interactions with them indirectly supporting the employment of over 56,000 people in Ireland.  The 29 SFI centres, comprise 10 Centres for Science, Engineering and Technology and 19 Strategic Research Clusters, act as magnets of attraction that significantly enhances IDA Ireland's capacity to win research-intensive investments to Ireland.Growth in researcher capacity, coupled with the enhanced R&D tax credit, continues to be a major attraction for overseas investors, and is resulting in a series of significant industrialR&D investments in Ireland by IDA supported companies. Over 40% of IDA investments in 2008 were in area of Research, Development and Innovation and accounted for approx. €420 millions in total investment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	625	There is already a large number of data-intensive multinationals located in Ireland and a critical mass has been developed in this field. This is contributing to a broad pool of skills in the operations of digital centres as well as in the development of new technologies such as in energy reduction.  The fact that Google, eBay, Facebook, PayPal and others have major activities here increases our profile internationally and gives further credibility to our quest to identify additional investors.  Ireland therefore, is well placed to attract additional projects, including those in trade-related data.  IDA Ireland's marketing activity in this regard is ongoing, and will be deployed to secure appropriate projects in this regard whenever possible.Enterprise Ireland has been very active in assisting approximately 350 companies in the indigenous digital sector through ongoing funding support at Third Level, Start-up, established and scaling companies. Enterprise Ireland has labelled the sector TIME (Telecom Internet Media and Edutainment).  The digital software sector represents one of the key areas for indigenous start-ups. Digital related HPSUs accounted for 50% of software start-ups.  The emergence of a cluster of such companies during 2007-2008, offers the potential for addition export growth for 2010-2012 and has the potential to mirror the Telco/mobile growth during the mid-1990s.Further research is being undertaken by Forfás on the opportunities in the field of electronic trade facilitation and a number of consultations have been undertaken in this regard. The degree to which Ireland could provide support to the international standards process, and the form such support could take, has been considered, as have the enterprise opportunities that might arise were Ireland to be seen as having a central role in this process.  Such opportunities could be related to particular aspects of the trade process, and could perhaps arise in areas such as trade finance, authentication, tracking and monitoring, legal processes, etc. and the associated software and services provision. I understand that Forfás is currently examining the possibility of support for the establishment in Ireland of an international body or organisation in a field related to electronic trade facilitation, in order to signal Ireland as being active and enthusiastic in this field.  I would be confident that this would encourage further development of business activities in related areas.In April 2010, the Revenue Commissioners will co-host the World Customs Organisation's (WCO) IT Conference and Exhibition.  The theme for this conference will be “Fusing data to deliver integrated business solutions”.  This conference and exhibition will provide an ideal opportunity to showcase Ireland.  By bringing worldwide attention to Ireland and its interest in this field, we will increase our international profile in the field of electronic trade facilitation, sensitise our own enterprises to opportunities and alert international companies to our capabilities.It should also be noted that Forfás has completed a feasibility study of a Single Window trade facilitation system for Ireland, based on an assessment of regulatory costs. This study is being considered by the High Level Group on Business Regulation and should be published this year. More generally, work will continue to advance the eGovernment agenda, since this, as well as improving efficiencies, will also help to advance our international reputation in the application of ICTs.My Department has made significant progress in a number of areas in the Smart Economy Framework since it was published last December.  The Government has taken short-term action to support economic activity and jobs, but overall, our policies to improve competitiveness have a long-term strategic objective which will restore confidence to the business community so that we continue to have jobs for the future.

The remaining practical issues are currently being pursued and once these are finalised I expect that I will be able to put final proposals to Government regarding the extension of the Act in 2010.

It examined the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The report also made a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme. The Group's report is published on my Department's website.Some 13,000 people benefited under the scheme in 2008 at an overall estimated cost of €76 million.  Any changes would have to be considered in the context of the annual Budget.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The Deputy will be aware of the Governments commitment under the Renewed Programme for Government to introduce new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments. Further work is ongoing on these issues with a view to early results.This work will build on existing Government supported solutions for dealing with home owners with mortgage arrears including: application of the new Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears which applies to all mortgage lenders; support from the Mortgage Interest Scheme under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance system which is providing vital support for over 14,000 families with mortgage difficulties; and the provision of advice on debt management through the Money Advice Budgeting Service (MABS).In addition the Government is also exercising its influence over those mortgage lenders covered by the Bank Guarantee Scheme including the recapitalised banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB with regard to the management of customers in arrears. I have already referred to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears which includes provision for a 6 month moratorium for those who go into arrears and 12 months in the case of the recapitalised banks.In relation to the position of mortgage holders generally, the Irish Bankers Federation published a Statement of Intent on 10 November which provides further reassurance to homeowners who find themselves genuinely unable to maintain mortgage repayments on their principal private residence.  The Statement of Intent has been agreed and supported by all IBF members and is a welcome development.  It is also welcome that the IBF Oversight Committee on the implementation of the Statement of Intent will include representation from the Money Advice Budgeting Service (MABS).The Deputy will have noted from recent debates in this House that the number of repossessions of owner occupied homes in this country remains very low particularly in comparison with our UK neighbours and other jurisdictions. The total number of owner occupied homes repossessed through the execution of court orders by the covered institutions for the period January to end September 2009 amounts to 20.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Persons aged over 65 are not automatically entitled to an exemption from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT).  Since April 2007, individuals are exempt from DIRT on their savings income provided:1. the person or their spouse is aged 65 or over and2. the person's total income in a year (including the savings income) is below the annual exemption limit —  currently €20,000 in the case of a single person and €40,000 in the case of a married couple.The exemption process works on a self assessment basis so that a person over 65 who is within the income limits completes the Form DE1 to have the account exempted from DIRT.  In the absence of this form, a financial institution must deduct DIRT.  However, where tax is deducted from the savings income of an individual who qualifies for the exemption but has not completed Form DE1, he or she will be entitled to a refund of that tax.There is no direct cost to the Exchequer in processing Forms DE1 since they are not processed by the Revenue Commissioners but are submitted to, and retained by, the financial institution — whether bank, building society or credit union — with whom the person has a deposit account. That institution then applies the exemption to any interest paid on that deposit account.I have no plans to change the current system as I consider it necessary in order to ensure that the exemption is applied correctly.

In the current circumstances, it is not possible to predict these factors accurately enough to provide a reliable potential yield figure.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	634	It is assumed that the Deputy has in mind replacing the existing mortgage interest relief rates of 20%, 22.5% and 25% for first time buyers with rates of 25%, 30% and 35% respectively. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that sufficient data on mortgage interest relief is not available to enable a precise estimate to be provided of the cost to the Exchequer of the changes mentioned by the Deputy. However, based on projected 2009 claims and making certain assumptions about the levels of mortgage interest payments appropriate to first-time buyers in years one to seven of their mortgages, the full year cost is estimated to be of the order of €130m.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	635	The annual earnings cap of €150,000 operates to limit the level of tax-relieved pension contributions made by an individual or on behalf of an employee in any one year. The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.The full year yield to the Exchequer arising from reducing the earnings cap to the amounts mentioned in the question are estimated as follows:Proposed Earnings CapEstimated Exchequer Yield€€m130,00030100,00085A breakdown of the data on pension contributions by reference to income levels is available only in respect of the tax relief for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) to the extent that these contributions are included in the personal tax returns of taxpayers.With regard to occupational pensions, (that is, schemes set up by the employer), the figures in respect of employee contributions are available only in aggregate form. Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to associate contributions with individual income levels. For that reason the estimated yields to the Exchequer in respect of these contributions are extremely tentative.The estimated yields are based on assuming that tax relief which would be affected by the changes mentioned in the question is currently allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and at the maximum age-related percentage limit of earnings. The figures provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer yield in respect of those taxpayers.Employer contributions are generally not made to personal pension plans such as RACs and PRSAs.  Data on employer contributions to occupational pension schemes are supplied annually to the Revenue Commissioners in aggregate form and not at the level of each individual employee. The employer contributions data are not therefore available in a way that would allow an adequate costing of the changes requested by the Deputy in this area to be made.As regards the suggested changes to the Standard Fund Threshold, the position is that Budget and Finance Act 2006 introduced a maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes. A limit of €5 million was placed on the total capital value of pension benefits that an individual can draw upon in their lifetime from tax-relieved pension arrangements. This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT).A higher limit (the Personal Fund Threshold — PFT) was also introduced at that time for individuals whose pension fund values exceeded €5 million on the date the SFT was introduced, 7 December 2005. The PFT was deemed necessary on the grounds that those individuals with pension funds in excess of €5 million had built up those funds in good faith over the years while availing of tax reliefs available by reference to the law as it stood prior to the change and it would not have been possible to retrospectively deny them those reliefs.The Finance Act 2006 also introduced indexation for both the SFT and PFT from 2007 onwards in line with an earnings factor. As a result, the value of the SFT for 2008 increased to over €5.4 million. Indexation did not occur in 2009 however.As with the Budget 2006 change, any reduced SFT limits as proposed by the Deputy would have to take account of the pension funds of individuals that had been built up legitimately above any new limit. Consequently, any reduction in the SFT would be unlikely to have immediate effects in terms of Exchequer savings.

This will allow for the designation of participating institutions and the designation of eligible assets among other issues. Then the valuation methodology, which is subject to EU approval, will be applied by NAMA on an asset by asset basis to determine the valuation for each asset.It will not be possible to provide a list of all the individual properties held by NAMA and their valuations. NAMA has a commercial mandate and it would be inappropriate to reveal such details that may put NAMA at a disadvantage in the market place.The NAMA legislation sets out that NAMA will make quarterly reports. These reports, amongst other things will include the number of all loans outstanding categorised as between performing and non performing loans. These quarterly reports should also provide the Deputy with the aggregate information on the value of the loans outstanding to NAMA and further detailed information as set out in Section 55 of the Act.

The Act does not prescribe what form the increases should take or how they should be calculated.A typical provision in a public service scheme would be that increases may be granted under the scheme as may be authorised from time to time by the Minister responsible, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.As the Government has made clear on a number of occasions, all public expenditure, pay and non-pay, current and capital, is under review in the context of the Budget.

The property in question was placed in the ownership of a Trust at that time.  The Commissioners of Public Works, in a corporate capacity, are one of the trustees.  The Trust, however, has not had an involvement in the day-to-day operation and management of the property, and the original owner or settlor has continued to be responsible for the care and maintenance of the property, including its employees, up to the present time.Under the terms of the Trust, the property will come into the absolute ownership of the State some 21 years after the death of the settlor.  The Office of Public Works has been involved in discussions with the settlor and his representatives recently to try and agree arrangements for the management of the property following his death.  The matter is still under consideration.

The pricing of fixed rate mortgages by lending institutions would normally be based on institutions own cost of obtaining fixed rate funding for the period in question plus a margin. The actual cost of funds for each institution cannot be assessed on a mortgage by mortgage basis as they manage the risk on a portfolio basis using several types of wholesale funding and derivatives, depending on the size of each institution and its mortgage book.Regarding the application of early redemption fees on fixed rate mortgages, when a borrower signs a fixed-rate mortgage contract with a mortgage provider, the lender in turn must in effect borrow the money at an agreed fixed rate. The mortgage lender must repay the money at this agreed rate, so there may be a cost to the institution if the fixed rate agreement is terminated before the agreed term. This gives rise to the redemption fee charged in these cases.The Financial Regulator carried out a review of this issue earlier this year and submitted a report to my Department and the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service. The review focused on the early redemption fees being applied by lenders on fixed rate mortgages and looked at, among other things,  actuarial reports examining the formulae applied by the different lenders.  The principal findings indicate that:the early redemption fee calculation in all cases appears to seek to cover the costs; andlenders do not generally apply additional fees in the case of early redemption. Lenders do not therefore seem to be applying financial penalties in order to dissuade borrowers from early redemption of fixed rate mortgages.Notwithstanding the findings of the review set out above, I am aware that the Financial Regulator would strongly advise that any borrower who believes that he/she has been charged an excessive early redemption charge should request his/her lending institution to provide a clear explanation of how the cost was calculated.  In the event that the borrower is not satisfied with the explanation, a formal complaint should be made to the lender and in the event of an unsatisfactory response, he or she should exercise his/her option to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman who will independently adjudicate on the matter.

The Supplementary Budget published last April forecast that corporation tax receipts would total approximately €3.7 billion in 2009 and €3.8 billion in 2010. At the end of October 2009, €2.8 billion in corporation tax receipts had been collected, which was €255 million ahead of target.November is a key month for tax revenue, in particular for corporation tax receipts. The end-November Exchequer Returns will be published on 2 December. The White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure will be published on 5 December and will provide an estimated end-year outturn and pre-Budget tax forecasts for 2010. Post-Budget tax forecasts for 2010 will be published on Budget day on 9 December.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics on the amount of corporation tax paid by multinational corporations are not separately available. However the yield in the calendar year 2008 from the largest payers of corporation tax, many of which are multinational corporations, is as follows:Estimated corporation tax yield In 2008€mTop 25 Corporation Tax Payers1,536.0Top 50 Corporation Tax Payers2,127.5The figures included in the table  are the amounts of corporation tax paid in 2008 by the top 25 and top 50 individual companies that paid the most corporation tax in the year  and does not include payments from any other related company within a corporation or company group.

The information provided in relation to public sector employees is based on activities which are classified in the NACE code system as Public Administration and Defence; Compulsory Social Security, Education and Health and Social work but excluding the categories of Driving School Activities, Dental Practice Activities and Veterinary Activities as being more appropriate to the private sector.

The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. NACE code classifications on tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf and the taxes collected are allocated to those codes without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them.While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided.  The sectors identified for this reply represent the closest equivalents in the NACE code system to the sectors mentioned in the question.  The figures provided for the estimated yield from each sector are confined to those activities which are defined within the NACE codes associated with the sector headings shown and do not include the yield from activities and businesses identified under other NACE codes which could be related, either in whole or in part, to the sectors listed. An example of these would be architecture, engineering and the manufacture of products used in construction are not included in the heading construction above.

Consequently the additional cost of reducing the VAT rate on parked goods and services below 12% is not included in the estimates provided for reducing the reduced rate by 2% or more.ReductionNew RateCost%%€m0.521.0-1671.020.5-3341.520.0-5012.019.5-6672.519.0-8343.018.5-1,0014.017.5-1,335The Income Levy was introduced in October of last year in Budget 2009 and the rates subsequently increased in the Supplementary Budget in April of this year. Based on the Supplementary Budget forecasts, it was estimated that the Income Levy would yield approximately €1.1 billion in 2009 and approximately €2 billion in a full year.  Revised forecasts will be published in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure on 5 December, which will set out tax forecasts for 2010 revenues on a pre-Budget basis. As is customary, post-Budget tax forecasts for 2010 and later years will be published on Budget day, 9 December.  As regards the income base for levies, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is estimated that approximately 95% is earned income and 5% is unearned income.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	646	As the Deputy will be aware, the institutions referred to were specified as covered institutions under the bank guarantee Scheme, established pursuant to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008. The systemic importance of each institution covered by the Scheme was confirmed by the Governor of the Central Bank, and the Scheme was approved by the European Commission under EU State aid rules. The European Commission also specifically acknowledged the systemic importance of one of the institutions, in its approval of the Government's provision of capital.As with our other major financial institutions, the systemic importance of these institutions derives from their scale and their integration with our economy. As per each institution's latest published accounts, the balance sheets exceed €88bn in one case and €14bn in the other. Each institution has a substantial deposit base, sourced through thousands of customers, companies and through other financial institutions, in Ireland and internationally. The loan book of each institution includes lending for land and development or associated exposures which is eligible for transfer to NAMA, and also significant levels of lending for commercial, investment, and residential property and to other sectors, which is not eligible for transfer to NAMA.  A key principle of the Government's action in addressing the financial crisis has been to maintain the viability of such systemic institutions, to prevent wider implications and costs for our economy, and eligibility for coverage by the bank guarantee Scheme and transfer of assets to the National Asset Management Agency is therefore structured on the basis of systemic importance.NAMA is being established to restore confidence in the Irish banking sector and facilitate the flow of credit into the real economy. Section 2 of the NAMA Act also provides that NAMA is being established, inter alia, to protect the taxpayers and the State's interest relating to the guarantees issued by the State in September 2008 and to facilitate the restructuring of credit institutions of systemic importance.  As regards NAMA, each institution wishing to participate must apply and will be assessed in line with the eligibility criteria outlined in Section 65(2) of the NAMA Act.

The type of buildings leased comprises mostly office accommodation but also includes stores, Garda Stations, etc.  The rental bill for 2009 is €120m.  The following table schedules the lease detail, occupancy and buildings held under these leases.This year, OPW has initiated a strategic review of the central Dublin office portfolio with a view to reducing the annual rent bill.  The freeing up of pockets of space in Dublin by staff that have decentralised has created the ideal opportunity to evaluate and improve on current performance in the areas of rental costs and space occupancy densities, the two key efficiency drivers. This programme will involve: Surrender of a number of leases, (initial surrenders earmarked to occur in 2010 will achieve annual rental savings of c. €6 million). The consolidation of our client Departments and Agencies into the State-owned portfolio and the better quality long-term leasehold properties.Where leases provide for rent reviews, OPW is pro-actively negotiating with Landlords to achieve best value for money within the confines of the relevant lease terms.OPW RefCountyLocationBuilding NameAddressRentable SqMRent PA€LSE1307CarlowCarlowCarlow Temp

Experience gained with the initial implementation of the levy will then be used to inform any further development of measure; in the absence at present of such experience it would be premature to consider whether or how it might be extended.

In that light I cannot comment on the possibility of ring-fencing the funds for a particular use.  Imposing a flat levy on sugary foods and drinks, irrespective of their weight or size, could in fact encourage people to buy larger products, as the levy would be a smaller proportion of the price of a larger product.

The legislation to establish NAMA includes detailed provisions on the staffing of NAMA including the assignment of staff to NAMA from the NTMA. Pages 22 — 24 of the NAMA draft business plan set out details on the proposed level of staffing in NAMA and the allocation of staff to different operational units.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	652	The purpose of the new windfall gains provisions is to apply a higher 80% rate of tax to the profits or gains from land disposals where those profits or gains are attributable to a rezoning decision by a local authority rather than to any value attributable to the work of the landowner. Rezoning is defined in the new provision as meaning a change in the zoning of land in a development plan or local area plan from a non-development land-use (agricultural, open space, recreational or amenity use or a mixture of such uses) to a development land-use (residential, commercial or industrial uses or a mixture of such uses) or from one development land-use to another, including a mixture of such uses. This 80% rate will apply where there is a disposal of land following its rezoning where that rezoning takes place on or after 30 October 2009 (the date of publication of the Report Stage amendment to the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 which introduced the windfall gains provision).This new tax rate will apply in respect of disposals by individuals or companies as part of their land dealing/developing trade or as the disposal of a capital item. The 80% tax rate will only apply to the part of the profits or gains that is attributable to the rezoning decision. Any part of the profits or gains that is attributable to other factors, such as construction operations on the land or the expectation that the land would be rezoned in the future (‘hope value') will continue to be taxed at the normal income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax rates, as appropriate.Subject to certain specified exceptions, the provisions will affect any individual or company who disposes of land that is rezoned on or after 30 October 2009. There are only two situations where such rezoned land may be disposed of without attracting the 80% tax rate:1. Where the land is sold to an authority possessing compulsory purchasing powers solely because of the exercise by that authority of its compulsory purchase powers or where such an authority has given formal notice that it will exercise those powers.2. Where the land is sold by a 75% subsidiary company of the National Asset Management Agency.The new provisions make no distinction between the disposal of a single site by a person who is not a builder or developer and multiple or ongoing disposals taking place as part of a building or development trade.  However, in common with all taxation measures, I will review the application of the "windfall tax" measure to once-off disposals of sites for housing in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill.  The new provisions do not contain a definition of "development land suitable for housing" as such a definition is not required as the 80% tax rate is not confined to land that is rezoned solely for housing purposes but also applies where land is rezoned for commercial or industrial uses or a mixture of these uses.

These issues relate to a potential Budgetary measure. In that context I would point out that it is the usual practice for the Minister for Finance not to speculate or comment in advance of the Budget on what it will contain and I do not propose to deviate from that practice.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from increasing the Capital Acquisitions Tax rate by 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% or 5% could be in the region of €10 million, €20 million, €30 million, €40 million and €50 million respectively.  However, it should be noted that this estimate is based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact of such an increase, which could lead to a less than expected result from a change to the tax rate. In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in theeconomy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 184 together.I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Anti-Contraband and Anti-Counterfeit Agreements concluded between the European Community together with participating Member States and Philip Morris International (PMI) and Japan Tobacco International (JTI) on 9 July 2004 and 14 December 2007 respectively.  These agreements provide a legal basis for co-operation between the European Anti Fraud Office, together with the Customs Services of the participating Member States and the tobacco manufacturers concerned in tackling the illicit trade in counterfeit and contraband cigarettes. This is implemented through a combination of sharing of information on counterfeit cigarettes and ensuring that legitimate product is not diverted into the illicit trade, through a combination of tracking and tracing consignments and carrying out due diligence checks on customers. The agreements also provide for both an upfront payment to be divided between the participating Member States and the European Commission and also payments in respect of certain qualifying seizures of cigarettes.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the payments received to date under these agreements are as follows:2007 — No payments received.2008 —  €965,378.52 received on 5 September 2008 in respect of 2007 from JTI.—  €959,703.49 received on 24 December 2008 in respect of 2008 from JTI.2009 — No payment received to date but payment is expected before the end of 2009 from JTI.These payments are in respect of Ireland's portion of the phased payments due over 15 years under Article 8 of the JTI Agreement. Ireland is ineligible for similar payments from PMI because it did not accede to this Agreement until 19 April 2005.No seizure payments, (i.e. payments in respect of seizures of genuine branded cigarettes of 50,000 cigarettes or more manufactured by the companies concerned that have not been released for consumption in the European Union) have been received from the companies concerned between 2007 and the present date. However one payment of €18,101.22 was received on 22 December 2006 in respect of a seizure of Philip Morris cigarettes made at New Ross, County Wexford on 6 December 2005.  In addition to these agreements, Revenue also concluded a national Memorandum of Understanding with JTI on 4 November 2009 which provides for co-operation and exchange of relevant information.  While no payments flow directly from this type of agreement, it is valuable in developing intelligence in the fight against tobacco smuggling.

However, Revenue sheriffs, county registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt within certain geographical boundaries known as a "bailiwick" which equates geographically with "county". Data on the net receipts of some taxes can be linked to bailiwicks to provide an estimated breakdown of receipts on a county basis.The following table sets out the estimated breakdown of net receipts for VAT (Domestic) for the years 2005 to 2008 inclusive.

The OECD do not collect this information annually, but instead use the results of the Comparison of Employment in the Public Domain (CEPD) survey. The results of the most recent survey from 2005 are presented in the table below, and are available in the OECD publication "Government at a Glance." The OECD point out that no international comparative data presently exist for public employment due to methodological difficulties and differing definitions.Due to the difficulty of standardising figures across 26 countries, these figures are not directly comparable with annual figures given by the Department of Finance for public service employees.

The interest of the assets of the dissolved Company become vested in the Minister for Finance.  The Minister may waive his interest in said assets, where appropriate, under the State Property Act (1954).  An application has been received from Lorcan Estate Resident's Association (LREA), which is currently being dealt with by the Chief State Solicitor's Office.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	666	The Government took steps in October 2007, via an amendment to the Central Bank Act 1997, to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and supervision of retail credit firms engaged in specialist or so-called sub-prime lending by the Financial Regulator. Such lenders were not previously subject to financial regulation in respect of lending activities. The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code. This regulatory regime has been in place since 1 February 2008 and is being implemented by the Financial Regulator. Consumer credit, including sub-prime lending, is also regulated in Ireland under the Consumer Credit Act 1995. The Act makes detailed provision for the form and content of loan agreements and for advertising of consumer credit.Some non deposit-taking mortgage lenders are required to notify charges under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended) to the Financial Regulator for approval. However interest rates are excluded from this requirement. Also, legal fees tend to be imposed by 3rd parties and then passed on directly by the institution to the consumer. In general these do not require approval.  When approving fees, the Financial Regulator takes the following criteria into consideration:promotion of fair competition;commercial justification;passing on any costs to customers; andthe effect on customers or a group of customers.The Financial Regulator has a Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears, which came into effect in February 2009 and which applies to mortgage lending activities with consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State. The Code is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator. Under the Code, where a borrower is in difficulty the lender will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.  I should also point out that people in serious debt or in danger of getting into serious debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	667	It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as far as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be and generally is the last resort for the lender. The preferred method of dealing with cases of arrears should be early intervention and engagement.  In the revised Programme for Government we have stated that we will be:Introducing new measures to protect families having difficulties with their home mortgage payments;Examining ways of expanding the existing options available for dealing with debt situations;Examining ways of expanding existing state sponsored mortgage-support measures;The commitments contained in the revised Programme for Government span the broad area of personal debt management and its legislative framework and, as several relate to the responsibilities of several Government Departments, they will require close collaboration in the period ahead. Further work is ongoing on these issues with a view to early results.  The Law Reform Commission's recently published Consultation Paper on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement has made an important contribution to this whole area. The Government are carefully examining their recommendations and relevant officials will be closely liaising with the LRC in regard to its remaining body of work.In relation to the position of mortgage holders generally, the Irish Bankers Federation published a Statement of Intent on 10 November which provides further reassurance to homeowners who find themselves genuinely unable to maintain mortgage repayments on their principal private residence. The Statement of Intent has been agreed and supported by all IBF members and is a welcome development. It is also welcome that the IBF Oversight Committee on the implementation of the Statement of Intent will include representation from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).This follows on from the IBF and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)   Operational Protocol on consumer debt, which was recently put into effect. The Operational Protocol will enable MABS and the IBF to continue to work together effectively when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors who approach the MABS Service for assistance.  It should be noted that there are already other important arrangements in place to assist consumers who have fallen into arrears or are in danger of falling into arrears.The Government provides support for payment of mortgages under the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme. This scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Service on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's principal private residence. Furthermore, people in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code sets out requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.  The Financial Regulator also has in place a Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. This Code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator. Under the code where a borrower is in difficulty the lender has to make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and the lender has to give consideration on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing the type of mortgage, or capitalising arrears and interest.Obviously cases will arise where the arrears persist despite newly agreed changes in repayment schedules. The Code provides that where such situations persist, the lender may reserve the right to enforce the mortgage agreement. However, it must wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence.  Furthermore, as part of their recapitalisation scheme, A.I.B. and Bank of Ireland will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate with the banks.

The answer to the Deputy's question is that it entirely depends on the contractual terms of the loans and the security provided for each of the loans when they were advanced by the institution. The issue can only be assessed on a case by case basis and depends on the contracts entered into for the loans including whether the borrower entered into cross collateralisation arrangements.

The other agencies brought on board at the planning stage of this multi-agency operation were An Garda Síochána, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Defence Forces including the Naval Service and the Air Corps, and also both Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs, Belfast, and the PSNI. In addition, the European Anti Fraud Agency, participated in order to co-ordinate international assistance and the necessary follow-up investigations abroad. All of the Irish agencies concerned participated fully in the operation and provided the necessary operational support based on their respective expertise.  The estimated retail value of the consignment is around €46.7m.Charges have not yet been preferred against any of the individuals arrested, as the investigation has not yet been completed. However, it is expected that a file will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in due course.  As regards, the level of co-operation between Customs and An Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners have assured me that the multi-agency approach is now standard practice in all large-scale fiscal smuggling operations and that, in this particular operation, the high level of co-operation contributed directly to the success achieved.

If that person's employment is in the public service then he or she is subject to the public service pension-related deduction in respect of the earnings from that employment. This liability arises under section 2(1)(b) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  I should add that there is an effective exemption of the first €15,000 of qualifying earnings from the public service pension-related deduction, insofar as the rate of contribution on earnings up to that amount in a full year is zero per cent.

Where a UK VAT-registered supplier sells goods, including coal, to a VAT-registered customer in this state the transaction is not subject to UK VAT and the Irish customer must self-account for Irish VAT, which in the case of coal is at 13.5%.  If a UK VAT-registered supplier sells goods to unregistered customers here the UK supplier must charge UK VAT on these supplies where the total of the supplies is less than €35,000 in a year.  Where the total value of supplies by a UK VAT-registered supplier to unregistered customers in Ireland exceeds €35,000 in a year the UK VAT-registered supplier must register and account for Irish VAT on all such supplies.In addition, the EU VAT Directives provide that any VAT registered trader who exports goods to a VAT registered person in another Member State must complete a VIES Statement detailing all the VAT registered customers in other Member States to whom he/she has supplied goods in respect of which that customer is liable for payment of the VAT due. The VIES Statements form the basis of compliance programmes in Member States.  Council Directive 2008/8/EC (amending Directive 2006/112/EC) provides for the more frequent filing of VIES Statements and provides that traders may submits Statements on a quarterly or monthly basis.  The increased frequency of filing the VIES Statements will further counter instances of potential evasion of VAT.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the issue of coal supplies by UK suppliers to Irish customers has been the subject of compliance enquiries in Revenue Regions.  It has also been brought to the attention of Revenue's Investigation & Prosecution Division who conducted enquiries with their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  The current position is that significant infringements of VAT legislation have not been identified. However, the risks of non-compliance in this area are being kept under continuous review.

This was part of the Government's response to employment difficulties by investing in labour intensive areas which will promote and sustain domestic employment and achieve other policy objectives.  Overall capital investment in 2009 is still about 5% of GNP — very high by international standards — and the current competitive environment for tender prices means that a higher level of infrastructure can be procured with a lower level of resources.As the Deputy is aware, capital investment generally supports employment directly as well as addressing issues that will help in sustaining employment, such as the development of key economic infrastructure including major transport projects, water services, school building, Science Technology Innovation capital etc.  The overall objectives set out in the Smart Economy strategy, including the identification of investments that help maximise labour intensity, will inform Government consideration both of 2010 allocations and allocations thereafter.

Under Section 4 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, there is an obligation on the employer who utilises this method of payment to provide a statement of wages and deductions to the employee (i.e. a payslip) as soon as may be after payment has been effected. However, I am advised that within the Civil Service there has been a considerable movement towards the provision of on-line payslips. This obviates the need in most cases for the issue of hard copy slips and the expenditure on payslips is small. While the potential for further reduction in making available payslips to employees is limited by the Payment of Wages Act, the increasing use of on-line pay slips will reduce remaining costs.

They provide a very effective automatic solution to reduce energy usage by switching off artificial lighting when there is either sufficient natural daylight or when the space is unoccupied.  It has long been the policy of the Office of Public Works to install this equipment in new office developments.  It is often not economically feasible to retrofit such equipment into existing lighting installations.  However, where other works, such as lighting refurbishment, are undertaken, the investment is usually justified.It is not practical to estimate the savings already accrued, or indeed the possible savings, if a more targeted campaign in the installation of lighting sensors was undertaken.  Savings are dependent on the cost of installation, the type of lighting installed, the occupancy profile of the building and the natural light available.  Lighting sensors form one part of the many solutions that are used to minimise energy wastage in public sector buildings.  It is the policy of the Office of Public Works to use the technology in all new build and refurbishment installations (where there is practicable reasonable return on the investment).  Other more sophisticated lighting control systems are also used, where appropriate.

In July 2009, the Group agreed a report, which recommended that a centralised liquidity mechanism (CLM) is put in place for credit unions as soon as possible.  Such a mechanism would compliment the introduction of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme for credit unions and further bolster public confidence.The function of the CLM would be to receive deposits from credit unions for the purpose of providing liquidity to other credit unions in need of temporary liquidity support. Such support should take the form of loans and be subject to formal loan agreements between the CLM and the credit union being supported. The CLM would require legislative provisions addressing Corporate Governance, Functions and Powers, Liquidity Operations, Regulatory Oversight and Funding and Investment Policy.  Detailed rules would be required in relation to areas such as its key function, the creation of the fund, terms and conditions of the liquidity assistance provided by the CLM, collateral requirements, and mechanisms for drawdown and underwriting.  On account of the risk potentially arising from the CLM's activities and the need to safeguard the movement and the regulatory system, it is essential that the CLM governance, operational and regulatory arrangements are clearly set out in legislation.The Registrar of Credit Union has prepared draft heads of Bill to amend the Credit Union Act 1997 to establish a Central Liquidity Credit Union membership of which would be limited to Credit Unions.  The objects of the Central Liquidity Credit Union would be the receipt of funds from its members by way of subscription for shares, the investment of the funds of its members in a safe and secure manner, the making of loans to solvent members in need of liquidity support and borrowing of funds from other sources.  This first draft was circulated to the credit union representative bodies for observations.  We are now considering their responses and will reconvene the Joint Review Group at an early date.

My officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area and will continue to do so, on an ongoing basis.In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has initiated a review in order to provide the Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing gambling architecture in the State. The review, amongst other things, will consider:the recommendations contained in the Report Regulating Gaming in Ireland;the existing law regulating gaming lotteries and other forms of gambling in the jurisdiction;international developments, in particular the experience of the UK's Gambling Commission;developments in relation to remote gambling (e.g. via the internet and mobile phones).As the Deputy may be aware, due to pressure on the betting sector, I decided to defer the introduction of the increase in the betting duty provided for in Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 pending a review. Accordingly, the Finance Act 2009 contains a provision for continuing the existing betting duty rate of 1% unless and until an order is made bringing the 2% rate into effect, or alternative betting  taxation arrangements are enacted. This decision is based on the premise that the betting sector will engage in constructive discussions about putting in place a fair and workable tax base for the sector.  Such discussions will, inter alia, touch on issues such as online/phone betting, which is largely untaxed, and look at proposals that could potentially bring this area into the tax net, if possible, while also protecting Irish employment in the sector. The precise form and level of taxation that might be applied will also be considered in that context.

I recently announced, following discussions with the motor industry, the introduction of a new VAT Margin Scheme in respect of second-hand cars with effect from 1 January 2010. Under the Margin Scheme, dealers will account for VAT on their profit margin, that is, on the difference between the cost of acquiring the car and its reselling price. This will apply to all second-hand cars purchased by dealers and resold on or after 1 January 2010.In relation to the introduction of a scrappage scheme, as the Deputy will be aware, taxes are considered in the context of the Budget process. It is the usual practice for the Minister for Finance not to speculate in advance of a Budget on what it will contain; and I do not propose to deviate from that practice.

The initial phase of the centralisation process commenced in January 2009 with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin City to the PCRS.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  The PCRS has processed over 55,000 medical card applications since the start of 2009.The HSE has informed my Department that the transfer of the case load from the two local health offices included a backlog of some 6,500 open cases which are being dealt with as a matter of urgency by the PCRS, and as a result, resources which would have been deployed in customer relations and phone answering have been assigned to deal with this backlog.  The HSE is arranging that additional resources are deployed to respond to phone queries, the majority of which relate to the outstanding applications.The Executive has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  The HSE has recently put in place a national on-line system to allow local health offices track the current status of applications in the PCRS.The centralising of the medical card application process is facilitating a number of enhancements to the level of customer service associated with these applications.  The HSE has indicated that later this month a facility will be available where a person can view the status of their medical card application on-line and if a mobile phone number is supplied with an application, updates by text message will be delivered to the applicant's phone.I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications (Under the new arrangements, the Executive will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours);Equitable application of eligibility across the country;Consistency of service provision to customers;Clearer lines of governance and accountability; andImproved unified data.My Department is currently in discussion with the HSE about putting in place a dedicated telephone number for Oireachtas members for enquiries about applications being processed by the PCRS.The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.

The (Pensions) Abatement Act 1965 provides a legislative basis for the suspension or reduction of an allowance (pension) where, after retirement, a scheme pensioner is employed in an agency / organisation in which the superannuation scheme paying the pension applies. In such cases remuneration and pension, for the specified period of re-employment, should not exceed the uprated remuneration for the post from which s/he retired. I am informed by the employer that the individual concerned works 91% of the wholetime equivalent (WTE) in this instance and that under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009  the pension related deduction is payable on all earnings from this employment.However, the pension related deduction does not apply to pensions and, accordingly, no such deduction has been made from the pension in payment to the person concerned.

Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services. In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP. In June 2006, I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards. For medical card and GP visit card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income. Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work. I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.

Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption  Bill  2009 when enacted.The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement or have been effected prior to the commencement of the new law.The issue of transitional measures for prospective parents who are at a definable stage in the adoption process when the Bill is enacted and who wish to continue to adopt a child from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, is being examined.  Prospective adoptive parents have waited a long time and it is my intention to be as flexible as possible in relation to applicants.My officials, in consultation with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, have been doing preparatory work on a possible bilateral agreement with Ethiopia. Consideration of this is at an early stage.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	702	Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) 32 local health areas.Under the HSE's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  The initial phase of the centralisation process commenced in January 2009 with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin City to the PCRS.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  The PCRS has processed over 55,000 medical card applications since the start of 2009.The HSE has informed my Department that the transfer of the case load from the two local health offices included a backlog of some 6,500 open cases which are being dealt with as a matter of urgency by the PCRS, and as a result, resources which would have been deployed in customer relations and phone answering have been assigned to deal with this backlog.  The HSE is arranging that additional resources are deployed to respond to phone queries, the majority of which relate to the outstanding applications.The Executive has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  The HSE has recently put in place a national on-line system to allow local health offices track the current status of applications in the PCRS.The centralising of the medical card application process is facilitating a number of enhancements to the level of customer service associated with these applications.  The HSE has indicated that later this month a facility will be available where a person can view the status of their medical card application on-line and if a mobile phone number is supplied with an application, updates by text message will be delivered to the applicant's phone.I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications (Under the new arrangements, the Executive will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours);Equitable application of eligibility across the country;Consistency of service provision to customers;Clearer lines of governance and accountability; andImproved unified data.My Department is currently in discussion with the HSE about putting in place a dedicated telephone number for Oireachtas members for enquiries about applications being processed by the PCRS.The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.

The guidelines are aimed at health professionals, teachers, members of An Garda Síochána and any other persons/ organisations involved in providing services to children.  This includes those involved in sporting, community and voluntary organisations. A revised version of the Children First guidelines will be published in the near future.The Department of Education and Science has devised Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures for primary and post-primary schools.  These Guidelines and Procedures are based on the Children First guidelines and give direction and guidance to school management and staff in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse, with the protection and well-being of the child being the most important consideration.  The Guidelines and Procedures set out the steps to be taken by school management and staff in dealing with suspicions or allegations of child abuse. I have requested the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy regarding the procedures followed after a report is made to the HSE.

The OMCYA has been allocated €1,500,000 from Dormant Accounts for the development of a structured programme of youth cafes.  Final decisions on the operation of this programme are still under consideration and it is anticipated the funding will be made available over 2010 and 2011.The focus of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) which is now under the remit of the OMCYA is not on the provision of youth cafés.  However a number of the facilities built under the YPFSF include a youth café area incorporated within the facility.  The objective of the Fund is to attract "at risk"  young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.The Youth Affairs Section that transferred from the Department of Education & Science to the OMCYA as of 1 January, 2009 has also provided funding in recent years to a small number of youth work projects that provide youth cafe facilities for young people.

Most food and drink sold by retail shops is chargeable at the zero VAT rate.  This includes most basic foodstuff, such as bread, butter, tea milk, vegetables, etc.  Certain items of food and drink are specifically excluded from the scope of the zero-rate and are taxable at rates of 13.5% and 21.5%.Food and drink liable to the 21.5% VAT rate include sweets, chocolates, confectionary, crisps, ice-cream, frozen deserts and similar frozen products, savoury snack products, soft drink and alcohol.  The type of products attracting this higher rate therefore includes the high sugar food and drink which might potentially contribute towards obesity, while more health products, such as fruit and vegetables are zero-rated.

It also identifies the particular role of accredited authorities in this regard.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	724	The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) is a self financing body. The setting of fees for the pharmacy profession is governed by the Pharmacy Act 2007.  It requires the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) to make an application for ministerial consent to any fees that it proposes to charge.  This process allows for the consideration, and examination, of the Society's fee proposals by my Department.  The PSI, when setting a fee for retail pharmacy businesses for the first time in 2008, engaged consultants to develop an evidence-based methodology for the determination of these fees.  The process included a comparative analysis of comparable international pharmacy regulators.The PSI recently applied for my consent, which I granted, to decrease its fees for the continued registration of pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants and retail pharmacy businesses for 2010. I have also recently refused an application by An Bord Altranais for my consent to an increase in registration fees for 2010.The PSI is obliged by the Pharmacy Act 2007 to submit its audited annual accounts and Annual Report to the Minister for laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The PSI also prepares an annual service plan and corporate strategy, which it submits to the Minister.With respect to the medical profession, the Medical Council is the statutory body charged with responsibility for the registration and regulation of medical practitioners in the State. Under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 modern governance arrangements apply to the Council including the production of a Statement of Strategy, Business Plan and Annual Report. The Act also provides for the Council's annual accounts to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The 2007 Act requires the Minister to ensure that the Council's Statement of Strategy, Business Plan and Annual Report are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It requires the Council to lay its audited accounts before each House of the Oireachtas.

To examine the equity, effectiveness and appropriateness of existing arrangements for compensating persons who suffer cerebral damage at, or close to, the time of birth.2. To review the clinical literature and other evidence on the causes of cerebral injury in infants.3. To review the existing legal framework within which persons seeking compensation must process their claims.4. To collect appropriate data on the incidence of brain damage caused in infancy.5. To review existing services for persons who suffer cerebral injury.6. To examine alternatives to that tort system whereby the care of brain damaged infants can be provided for including systems based on the no fault principle.7. To examine strategies that might be used to reduce the incidence of cerebral damage at birth.8. To make such recommendations as the group sees fit.The Group had undertaken a significant amount of work by early 2004 when it ceased to meet due to the dispute with hospital consultants on the introduction of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.  In 2006 I asked the chairman, Dr. Peter McKenna, to reconvene the group with a view to having a report produced.  The Group met on a regular basis until 2008.  Due to the pressure of other commitments in 2008 and 2009 it has not proved possible to complete the report to date.  However, members of the Group have continued to be in contact and work on the preparation of the report has continued.  It is intended that a meeting of the Group will be convened in order to review progress in the New Year.  I will await the Group's report before giving further consideration to a wider no fault compensation scheme for the health services.

The advice of the Health Information and Quality Authority on pre-hospital care issues will be a significant factor in determining how services should be organised so that clinical governance, patient safety and quality standards are met.  As the specific question raised by the Deputy is a matter for the HSE, it has been referred to the Executive for direct reply.

The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted. The Bill commenced its second stage process in Dail Eireann on the 18th November.With regard to the issue of ‘independent' adoptions, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the provisions set out in Part 13 of the Adoption Bill which identify the restrictions on a person in seeking to make arrangements for adoptions.  It also identifies the particular role of accredited authorities in this regard.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I have considered all the relevant advice available to me in relation to the potential public health benefits of HPV vaccination in the prevention of cervical cancer and the wider policy implications for its possible introduction into the National Immunisation Programme.  I accept the consensus view of the relevant expert bodies that the introduction of a universal high uptake vaccination programme in young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer incidence.  All of the clinical advice available to me indicates that, in the context of the limited resources available, the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme should take precedence over the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme.  Accordingly, CervicalCheck, the national cancer screening programme commenced in September 2008. To date, more than 250,000 women have been screened.In relation to cancer prevention and screening measures, my next priority is a colorectal screening service for men and women.  This is supported by Prof. Tom Keane of the National Cancer Control Programme and also the Irish Cancer Society.  There are around 2,200 new cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed each year in Ireland and around 950 deaths.  A successful colorectal cancer screening programme has the potential to reduce incidence by 14.7% and mortality by 36%.  I remain committed to the introduction of a cervical cancer vaccination programme at the earliest possible opportunity in accordance with clinical priorities.

I understand from the Shannon Airport Authority (SAA) that airline and passenger feedback of the facility to date has been very positive. Having completed Preclearance at Shannon Airport, both the airlines and passengers enjoy the advantages associated with arriving at a Domestic Airport terminal in the U.S. This has enabled significantly faster passenger processing times through these terminals and shorter connection times for onward destinations.Operational decisions about the use of the preclearance facilities are a matter for the Airport Authority and the United States Department of Homeland Security and the airlines concerned. The next phase of Preclearance at Shannon is to extend its use to general aviation traffic. The necessary infrastructure is in place for General Aviation Preclearance and my Department, in conjunction with the SAA, is working with the U.S. authorities to start this phase of Preclearance as quickly as possible.

Ireland's first National Cycle Policy Framework, which I announced in April of this year, makes clear the significant level of ambition that I have for cycling.  The actions on behalf of cycling that I have taken since then, as reported on http://www.smartertravel.ie/progress-updates, demonstrate my commitment to achieving the goals of the framework.In relation to education of young people regarding cycling standards, I view this as a key intervention that can deliver lasting benefits. On this basis, I have recently established a Working Group on the Establishment of a National Certificate for Cycling for School Children with representation from the Dept of Education and Science, the Irish National Teachers Organisation, the Road Safety Authority, An Taisce's Greenschools Travel Programme, the Dublin Transportation Office, a number of local authorities and my Department.

The office is hosting a Ship Finance Seminar on 1 December to provide an overview to Irish based companies on current obstacles and opportunities in the global shipping markets. The slowdown in global demand coupled with underlying problems in the international ship finance sector have created difficult market conditions for Irish and foreign shipping groups. Despite these difficult conditions, a number of companies involved in the international ship finance and management sector continue to be based in Ireland. This number was boosted recently by the announcement by TBS Marine Inc, a US listed shipping group, to establish and domicile its European operations in this country.

The Oral hearing on the railway order application, which was adjourned by An Bord Pleanála earlier this year, will recommence on 30 November. The project is being procured as a PPP and two tenders have been shortlisted. The next phase of procurement must await the outcome of the statutory approval. As I have stated previously the start and completion date of the project will be contingent on the statutory planning approval process and the public procurement process. The project will also be submitted to Government for a final decision at the conclusion of the procurement process.I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 128 on 5 November in relation to expenditure to date on the project. €159 million was allocated to the RPA, following the supplementary Budget in April, to progress Luas and Metro projects, including Metro North, in 2009. I understand from the RPA that the estimated outturn for expenditure on Metro North will be approximately €30 million. Decisions on the Exchequer allocation for future years will be taken as part of the Estimates process for each year.

The Agency expects to lodge an application for a railway order in respect of Metro West next year. Metro West will be procured as a PPP. The start and completion dates for this project will be determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate. The current funding environment is very difficult and it will not be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescale envisaged at its launch. Nevertheless, I am seeking to progress planning of Metro West to ensure we are in a position to move speedily to construction as soon as financial circumstances permit. The commencement and completion dates for this project will also be contingent on the relevant statutory planning process and the procurement and contract award processes. Expenditure incurred to end-September 2009 on Metro West is €9.4 million. €159 million was allocated to the RPA, following the supplementary Budget in April, to progress Luas and metro projects, including Metro West, in 2009. I understand from the RPA that the estimated outturn for expenditure on Metro West will be approximately €6 million.  Decisions on the Exchequer allocation for future years will be taken as part of the Estimates process for each year.

I understand from Iarnród Eireann that an application for a railway order for the DART Underground will be submitted to An Bord Pleanála in early 2010. It is intended to procure the DART Underground project as a PPP. Iarnród Eireann is planning to commence the formal procurement process during 2010. €404 million was allocated to Iarnród Eireann, following the supplementary Budget in April, to progress the rail safety and development programme, including the DART Underground project. I understand from Iarnród Eireann that the estimated outturn for expenditure on the DART Underground project is approximately €15 million. Decisions on the Exchequer allocation for future years will be taken as part of the Estimates process for each year. The start and completion dates of Transport 21 projects in planning, such as the DART Underground, will in each case be determined by the outcome of public consultation, the statutory planning approval process, the public procurement process and the availability of financial resources determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate.

I understand that the Consumer Protection Act 2007 makes it an offence for a trader to engage in a misleading commercial practice, which would include the provision of false information in relation to a "products usage or prior history" to the extent that the information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that the average consumer would not otherwise make. The National Consumer Agency enforces this legislation and provides advice for prospective buyers in its Guide to Buying a Car.

Steps to this end include the following:(a) Where possible early pre-trial negotiation and settlement;(b) If necessary the use of court procedure to lodge/tender money in a court;(c) Mediation or arbitration.I am informed that avoiding unnecessary costs is a cardinal principle in the conduct of litigation by the CSSO and Attorney General's Office and procedures are in place for that purpose. There are also measures in place to insure, in so far as possible, a single legal team represents State bodies. The Deputy will appreciate that there are cases involving Government Departments and their agencies in which serious legal issues arise which can only be resolved by the court and mediation and arbitration are not real options.The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies makes clear that where a legal dispute involves another State body every effort should be made to mediate, arbitrate or otherwise before expensive legal costs are incurred. The Arbitration Bill 2008 which I have promoted and which is before the House will further streamline our arbitration code in line with best practice internationally. Rules of Court continue to be developed to facilitate adjournment of proceedings in our courts to permit mediation. It is my view that a more structured approach to mediation is required in our legal system than exists at present. The Final Report of the Law Reform Commission on Alternative Dispute Resolution is expected in the near future. It is keenly awaited by the Government.

Based on the information provided by the Deputy it would appear that the person referred to in the Deputy's question falls into the latter category. However, officials in the Citizenship Division of my Department inform me that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person concerned. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant mustbe of full agebe of good characterhave had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four yearsintend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisationhave made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the StateIn the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.

In general, removals are carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return. In other cases, it is necessary for removals to be carried out by way of charter flights. Larger charters are organised to remove disruptive deportees that commercial airlines will not take on account of previous disruptive behaviour on board aircraft. Bigger charters are organised to return larger numbers of deportees in a more efficient way than using schedule flights. Deportations are always carried out with due regard for the dignity of the deportee.

Attendees at the conference came from a broad range of groups and organisations including those representing brain injured persons, the elderly and the intellectually disabled. Submissions received and views expressed at the conference have been examined for consideration during drafting of the detailed provisions of the Bill, which is now underway.

I would moreover point out that the role of the Private Security Authority is to control and supervise persons providing security services and to maintain and improve standards in the provision of those services. A system of licensing ensures that only those persons who are qualified to the required standards, and vetted by the Gardaí, are permitted to operate in any of the licensable sectors of the industry.While the purchase of an intruder alarm system does not require a license, it is an offence under section 37 of the Act to install one on a commercial basis without a PSA licence, unless otherwise exempted. A core function of the Authority is to investigate all those operating illegally, outside of the licensing regime, and also those who engage their services. It has been an offence since August 2006, under Section 38 of the Act to engage unlicensed contractors and consequently a person found to have engaged such a contractor is committing an offence. In this regard, the Private Security Authority can, pursuant to Section 13(1) of the Act investigate any security services being provided by any person.

I have been advised by the Authority that the licence fee has not been increased since 2005. In setting the fee, the Authority is mindful of the need to balance licensing fees with general Government policy that the cost of regulation should not be a drain on general Exchequer resources. I will ask the Authority to review the fee structure in the context of its strategic plan for 2010-2012.

I am informed that generally, with long-term leases, rent reviews and lease breaks are provided for on a rolling five year basis. I understand that where there is provision for a rent review or a lease break, the OPW does enter into negotiations based, in part, on current market values. As regards my own Department, there are currently three offices occupied by Department staff where rent is paid. The rent in each case is fixed but where there is both a desire to continue to use the building in question and where there is a provision for an imminent rent review, I can inform the Deputy that my Department will be negotiating for a significant downwards review. In some cases, this process has already been initiated well in advance of the formal review date with a view to reducing over expenditure in this area.

This is a long standing principle of our system of justice.  The role of the Gardaí is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP.  The Director, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law. I am informed by the Garda authorities that expertise is available within the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation for the investigation of the type of crimes referred to by the Deputy. Such investigations are also conducted in conjunction with other appropriate agencies, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Office of the Financial Regulator.

In this regard, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to have any involvement with an individual application. However to be of assistance in the matter, I have had enquiries made with the Tribunal in relation to the application referred to by the Deputy. I understand from the Tribunal that arrangements are in place between the Applicant's solicitors and the Tribunal to hear the case in question on 7 December, 2009.

These consultations are well advanced at this stage. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to her.

The availability of such a permit, which will be granted by the District Court subject to compliance with statutory conditions and payment of the specified fee, will relieve nightclubs of the necessity of repeatedly applying for special exemption orders in order to remain open beyond normal licensing hours. Under existing arrangements, operators of nightclubs may apply at regular intervals to the District Court for special exemption orders and such orders may be granted by the Court subject to compliance with conditions set out in section 5 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927, as amended. Special exemption orders normally expire at 2.30 a.m. (1.00 a.m. on Monday mornings), unless the Court, for stated reasons, considers it expedient to grant the order for a shorter period. With the addition of 30 minutes drinking-up time, premises benefitting from special exemption order may remain open until at 3.00 a.m. (1.30 a.m. on Monday mornings). The regulation of licensing hours, including those applicable to nightclubs, is a matter for individual Member States and generally reflects the unique historical, social and cultural aspects of the country concerned. Member States generally have regard to factors such as their alcohol consumption patterns and levels of alcohol-related harm as well as public policy objectives such as promoting public health and maintaining public order.

Personnel attached to Community Policing are eligible to go forward for promotion having met criteria set out under the provisions of these Regulations. There is no provision for a special promotion system for Community Gardaí or indeed for any other cadre within the Garda organisation.

As a result, any decision taken in relation to the adult brother of the person concerned applied equally to the person concerned.The brother of the person concerned was granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of his marriage to an Irish national, until 26 May 2000. This permission was subsequently renewed until 26 May 2001. This permission also applied to the person concerned. The person concerned formally withdrew his asylum application on 24 June 1999.The adult brother of the person concerned and his Irish spouse separated in 2000 and, as a consequence, his application for renewal of his permission to remain in the State was refused. This decision applied equally to the person concerned.In 2003, the person concerned applied for a certificate of naturalisation but this application was refused as the person concerned was deemed to have insufficient periods of legal/reckonable residence in the State.The marriage of the adult brother of the person concerned was annulled by Court Order dated 22 June 2004. As a result,  a notice of intention to deport letter, as provided for under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), issued to the person concerned on 3 August 2004.The case of the person concerned was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of refoulement following which, on 1 December 2005, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this Order was served on 7 December 2005. The person concerned was deported the following day.Further representations dated 6/03/2009 were received from the person concerned asking that his Deportation Order be revoked, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). Following consideration of the information submitted, the Deportation Order was affirmed and the person concerned and his legal representative were advised of this decision by letter dated 27 April 2009.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must remain outside of the State.

However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The application of the person concerned was received on 27 June 2005 and, as such, was received too late for consideration. In any event as the child referred to in that application was born after 1 January 2005, he would not have an automatic entitlement to Irish citizenship. The person concerned was made aware of the non-acceptance of her IBC/05 application by letter dated 2 August 2005.The person concerned, again through her legal representative, subsequently submitted a request under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) seeking the permission of the Minister to consider an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with those Regulations which came into force on 10 October 2006.

Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2009 up to 31 October, 263 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 215 to children. One good behaviour contract in respect of a child has been agreed.I am further informed that in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2008, 203 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 247 to children. Three good behaviour contracts were agreed in respect of children. In addition, one civil order was issued in respect of an adult.In setting up the regime the intention was that these interventions — warnings, good behaviour contracts and referrals to the Juvenile Diversion Programme — would address the problem behaviour.  If they succeed, there will be no need to apply to the courts for an order.  It is only if they fail to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question, that a court order will be applied for.

This represents an increase of just over 33% in the total number of Garda Reserve and trainees from 31st October 2008. On that date there were 112 operational members of the Garda Reserve based in the Dublin Metropolitan Region with a further 63 in training in that Region.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	819	The issue of the monies seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau being used to fund community projects and drug services in disadvantaged urban communities is one which is raised on a periodical basis.This is primarily a matter for the Department of Finance and the view on this issue is that while it is accepted that there may be some potential symbolic value in the idea that the suggestion is one which is problematic and raises a number of particular difficulties including as follows.Firstly the Constitution requires and Government accounting principles provide that public monies be spent only as voted or approved by Dáil Éireann unless otherwise provided by statute.A policy of ringfencing monies obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose, sometimes described as the hypothecation of revenue, would run contrary to the normal Estimates process.Under this process, revenue which has been accumulated by the Criminal Assets Bureau is paid into the Government's Central Fund. It is this Central Fund from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment including the provision of drug services.While allowing for a very small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.It could also be argued that a significant proportion of the monies secured by the Bureau are already owed to the Exchequer as it often relates to non-payment of taxes and social welfare fraud.In the case of drugs services the Government is already allocating very considerable resources to a wide range of Government Departments and State Agencies as well as to the Community and Voluntary treatment sectors to tackle the issue of drug misuse. There are also very practical difficulties with the proposal as the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the Bureau in any given year in addition to the potential delays through the possibility of legal challenge to court disposal orders is problematic in terms of the provision of ongoing fund to drugs programmes or projects. Such a revenue source would not facilitate the proper planning of drug treatment provision or other such programmes by organisations involved in the delivery of services.There is also the problem of additional costs which would accrue in the administration of any scheme to divert CAB funds to community programmes. It would mean additional administrative costs without any additional revenues being generated.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	820	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all agencies involved in Operation Samhna, which led to the seizure of an estimated 120 million cigarettes at Greenore, Co. Louth in October.  This multi-agency cross border operation was led by officers of the Revenue Custom's Service and supported by An Garda Síochána, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Irish Naval Service, and the Air Corps.  Officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) were also prominent.  The European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF was involved from the outset and they will coordinate the follow-up investigations in the Philippines where the vessel was loaded.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the seizure resulted in nine arrests.  Following interviews, all of the persons arrested were released without charge, pending the preparation of an investigation file by the Revenue Commissioners, once all necessary inquiries have been completed.I am advised that there is excellent level of cooperation and sharing of information that between these organisations.  While the Revenue Commissioners have primary responsibility in relation to cigarette smuggling, a multi-agency approach is adopted where appropriate.Both organisations also work closely together on other issues and I wish to commend the ongoing success of our Joint Task Force on Drugs through which An Garda Síochána, Revenue's Customs Service and the Irish Naval Service come together and  co-operate closely in joint operations targeting drug trafficking.Both An Garda Síochána and the Customs Service are working side by side at the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) in Lisbon which is an excellent example of inter-agency cooperation.  The Deputy will recall that in November 2008, with the assistance of the Lisbon Centre, Operation Seabight resulted in the seizure of 1.5 tonnes of cocaine off our south west coast from the yacht "Dances with Waves".  This was regarded as a very significant drug seizure globally.

The person referred to by the Deputy was informed of the decision to refuse this application on 18 September 2009.   A request for review of this decision was received on 27 October 2009 from his legal representative and the decision to refuse this application is currently under review.

I understand that the Group is now considering the results of a consultation exercise which has just concluded.  I have been informed that the Group is hoping to report towards the end of this year.

In 2009 to date some 321 new hosting agreements have been approved.  The immigration authorities have also ensured that researchers and other highly skilled workers are specially facilitated in terms of residence permission and family reunification where relevant.

This building contains a number of educational, recreational and support service facilities and as such it is not possible to indicate the precise costings of the workshops within the overall figure.Two workshops have been fitted out to provide training in construction skills and industrial cleaning.  Two assistant industrial supervisor posts were agreed to run these workshops.  However, due to the Moratorium on Recruitment and Promotions in the Public Service we have not been able to fill these posts. We are currently examining the options, within the confines of the Moratorium, to address this issue.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	825	I wish to inform the Deputy that on 20 November 2009 there were 139 persons in custody in the centre the subject of this Parliamentary Question.The aims and objectives of open centres is to provide a place of detention aimed at the rehabilitation of offenders through education and training linked with a regime which encourages a sense of personal responsibility and self respect in order to assist  them leading law-abiding lives on their return to the community. Generally speaking the profile of offenders sent to open centres includes either low risk offenders who are serving short sentences for minor offences or offenders nearing the end of longer sentences whose transfers have been approved as part of a sentence management programme.The centre has a modern purpose-built education centre which is equipped with both practical and general purpose classrooms.  The education centre caters for approximately 59% of the prisoner population on a weekly basis.  Subject areas available to prisoners who attend the education centre include Home Economics, Health Education, Art/Craft, Woodwork, Computers, Music, Physical Education and Science. Among the certification options available are Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, FETAC, ECDL and Open University.Occupational training is also available to prisoners in catering, laundry and horticulture/farm workshops. Two new workshops have recently been fitted out to provide training in construction skills and industrial cleaning.  Two Assistant Industrial Supervisor posts were agreed to run these workshops. Due to the moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the Public Service, the Irish Prison Service has not been able to fill these posts. We are currently examining the options, within the confines of the moratorium, to address this issue.I have not received any complaints in relation to prisoners detained in the centre not being properly vetted nor has my attention been drawn to any persons suffering from a heroin addiction being sent to this centre. Prisoners transferred to an open centre have, in each case, a wide range of factors taken into account prior to transferring including the nature of their offence, length of sentence, engagement with the therapeutic services and behaviour while in custody.  All prisoners are medically assessed on committal to prison and treatment needs are determined based on the clinical presentation.Prisoners are monitored on an ongoing basis and if they present with a medical difficulty, are again medically assessed and, if necessary, transferred elsewhere for appropriate treatment.The Irish Prison Service Canine Unit does not currently provide a drug detection dog service to the centre but that situation will change when further dogs and handlers complete their training in 2010.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	826	Current staffing levels and configurations for each of the prisons were established in the context of the Change Agreement reached with the Prison Officers' Association in 2005.  The Agreement involved substantial changes to staff deployment which could only be achieved over time.  At present, staffing levels and configurations are actually quite close to what was envisaged when the Agreement was reached with the Prison Officers Association.In 2008 a new accommodation block, which is not isolated and forms part of the prison complex, opened in Loughan House, open centre requiring additional staffing. New staff levels were established following agreement with the Prison Officers Association. The Deputy will appreciate that in a large organisation such as the Irish Prison Service, surpluses and shortfalls in staffing have to be managed on an ongoing basis.  However, I am advised that the IPS is satisfied that there is an adequate level of staff in Loughan House at present.  Of course, staffing levels in all prison facilities will continue to be kept under review in the context of the Department of Finance Moratorium.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The costs of translating documents into Irish are met from my Department's Administrative Budget and unfortunately cannot readily be distinguished from the cost of providing administrative services generally.  Accordingly the information sought by the Deputy could not be compiled without the application of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.However, I can inform the Deputy that in order to meet public information obligations in relation to official publications, be they in English or Irish, it is my Department's policy to issue CDs or to use other IT based publication tools such as PDF formats. This policy also covers the publishing of documents, such as annual reports, on my Department's website.   I have taken a personal interest in this issue and consequently directed that my Department ensures that where hard copies of documents are required, they are prepared for publication by the use of in-house copying equipment. As a consequence of implementing this policy, printing and postal costs are kept to an absolute minimum. I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate the importance of this policy given that my Department's Administrative Budget for 2009 comprises only 77% of such expenditure in 2008.I can also inform the Deputy that, in common with other categories of expenditure, my Department seeks to provide Irish language services with an eye to securing value for money. To illustrate this, the Deputy may wish to note that since February 2003 my Department has been involved in a major on-going Irish language project, the translation of the Rules of Court. To facilitate the efficient and effective completion of this project my Department has employed an in-house translator principally to oversee and carry out the translations of these Rules. In December 2004 the 1,200 page Irish translation of the District Court Rules, 1997 was published. This translation is available on the Courts Service website www.courts.ie. It is expected that the Irish translation of the Circuit Court Rules, 2001 will be published in the coming months. The translation of the forms contained in these Rules are currently before the Irish Legal Terms Advisory Committee for verification. By engaging an in-house translator instead of seeking outside service providers my Department estimates that it has made significant savings on this project.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	830	The Department of Foreign Affairs and our network of Embassies and Consulates work closely and cooperatively with other Government Departments and State Agencies to optimise the promotion of Ireland overseas. With a view to more effective coordination of the Government's overseas promotional activities, the document Building Ireland's Smart Economy envisages Ambassadors in major markets taking an active role in this regard. In implementation of this Action Point, Ambassadors in the major markets have been instructed to more actively pursue trade and economic promotional activity and convene regular meetings with State Agencies, which are represented on the ground, to coordinate and report on promotional efforts.Close cooperation also takes place between my Department and other Government Departments and Agencies to ensure that the best use is made of the promotional opportunities presented by Ministerial visits overseas. Embassies are expected to identify possible economic promotion events to be included in Ministerial itineraries. This is particularly the case in relation to Ministerial visits abroad for St. Patrick's Day, where every effort is made to ensure that, as was the case this year, the themes, programmes and messages for these visits have a strong economic content. Earlier in the year a letter was issued from my office to the offices of other Ministers nominating a focal point in the Department (the Promoting Ireland Abroad Division) to liaise with these offices and our Embassies abroad so as to ensure that, throughout the year, Ministers are aware of promotional opportunities in overseas markets.Last September, with a view to stimulating and enhancing economic links with the overseas Irish, I organized the Global Irish Economic Forum, which was held at Farmleigh. It brought together international business, cultural and political figures with Irish links, or a strong interest in Ireland. The Forum was convened with two broad objectives: to explore how the Irish at home and abroad, and those with a strong interest in Ireland, could work together and contribute to our overall efforts at economic recovery; and to examine ways in which Ireland and its global community could develop a more strategic relationship with each other, particularly in the economic sector.A range of themes and specific proposals emerged from the Forum, including the issue of a new global Irish network. Work has already begun in my Department on the establishment of such a network, composed of those invited to Farmleigh. The Government has established a new inter-Departmental Committee of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General to the Government to consider and take forward the work of the Forum. This group will report directly to Government, which will review progress on a regular basis.In October this year, in implementation of the recommendations contained in the US/Ireland Strategic Review, I chaired the inaugural meeting of the Irish-American Leadership Council in New York. The Council brings together the national leadership of Irish-American business, community, philanthropic and cultural organizations throughout the United States. It is intended to act as a point for collective consultation and advice for the Government across a wide spectrum of issues.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	831	The core objective of Ireland's aid programme is to contribute to the elimination of extreme poverty and hunger. The programme, which is administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, is sharply focused on the least developed countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa. We have long term strategic programmes in nine priority countries, and also work in close cooperation with Non-Governmental Organisations, the UN and other multilateral organisations. The Government recognises the important role volunteers can play in the development programme. The Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre in Dublin works to encourage and facilitate the strong public interest in global development, and in volunteering.Over the past year, Irish Aid has worked to increase public awareness of all available overseas volunteering opportunities. Two successful volunteering fairs have been organised in the Volunteering and Information Centre this year, with up to 900 individuals attending. Over twenty overseas volunteering organisations, many of which are funded by Irish Aid, participated in the fairs in order to recruit professionals for particular assignments in developing countries. Irish Aid hopes to organise similar overseas volunteering fairs in Cork and Limerick early in 2010. The Volunteering and Information Centre has also facilitated more than 70 other events this year which focused on overseas volunteering.In addition, Irish Aid is now in the final stages of recruiting sixteen young people for the 2010 United Nations Volunteers internship programme. Through this programme, 55 Irish interns have had the opportunity to work with the United Nations since 2006. Despite the current budgetary pressures, I believe it is important that we continue to fund this recruitment programme as part of the overall Irish contribution to development.In recent months, I have ensured that Irish Aid has worked closely with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and other Departments to support volunteer placements in the domestic and international voluntary sector. While there are many opportunities for volunteers to engage with Non-Governmental Organisations in Ireland, the identification and placement of large numbers of people in appropriate overseas assignments is more challenging. Irish Aid is actively engaged with a range of volunteering organisations to identify placements which will promote development in the poorest countries and provide volunteers with an opportunity to make a real contribution in the fight against poverty and hunger.The aid programme has also played a strong role in promoting the importance of health, safety and security issues across the volunteering sector. Through an agreed code of practice, volunteering organisations have agreed to address issues such as training and induction, cultural awareness, logistical support, transport and accommodation, monitoring, reporting and evaluation. This reflects the importance of ensuring that all volunteering assignments are suited to an individual's capacity and experience and are of benefit to the host organisation and community in the developing world.All aspects of the Government's aid programme are constantly under examination in order to ensure that they contribute to maximum effect to the fight against global poverty and hunger. I can assure the Deputy that any proposals in relation to the further development of volunteering opportunities overseas receive would receive detailed consideration on this basis.

In addition, I have personally met with a number of victims' groups. It is essential that, as we seek to move to a better future for all the people of this island, we do not leave behind those who have suffered most from the conflict in the past.This obligation informs the Government's contacts with the British Government where we consistently raise issues which are the legacy of the Troubles, at political level as well as in ongoing official contacts. The broader question of how to respond to the difficult outstanding issues from the Troubles, such as how best to meet the needs of all victims and survivors, was examined in detail by the Eames-Bradley Consultative Group on the Past, which reported to the British Government earlier this year. The Government is working closely with its British counterpart to consider how the recommendations of the Consultative Group on the Past might be taken forward.

However, a provision to terminate the lease on these premises in 2010 has recently been invoked.Ground floor of Findlater House, 27 -31 Upper O'Connell Street, Dublin 1 which has a total floor area of 523.4 square metres at cost of €417,450 per annum. The lease on these premises was negotiated by the Office of Public Works on behalf of my Department.All other rent commitments relating to properties in the State occupied by the Department of Foreign Affairs are discharged by the Office of Public Works.In addition, 109 properties are rented by my Department outside the State for use primarily as offices and official residences.  The projected total rental cost of these properties in 2009 is €15.518m.  Rental agreements vary from country to country in accordance with local law and practice.  Leases are usually for a fixed period and any include a rent review clause. Rent increases on renewal of leases are generally in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the particular country.  Rent levels abroad are reviewed each year. In addition, earlier this year all our Missions were instructed to explore the scope for negotiated reductions, having regard to local market conditions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	834	I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 362 together.I refer the Deputy to my reply to Oral Question 60 on 18 November 2009, which was as follows:The Goldstone Report is a serious and important document, which seeks to sift fact from allegations and rumour, and to determine so far as possible what happened in and around Gaza in the conflict at the beginning of this year, and how to pursue accountability for any violations of international humanitarian law which occurred. The members of the Fact Finding Mission led by Judge Goldstone, and including retired Irish Colonel Desmond Travers, are to be commended for the diligence and fairness with which they have attempted to carry out their mandate, including in rising above the regrettably one-sided nature of the original Human Rights Council Resolution which led to the establishment of the Mission.Ireland has spoken in favour of the Report in our current capacity as observers at the Human Rights Council, and voted in favour of the Resolution on the Report at the UN General Assembly on 5 November. Ireland was one of five EU member States to vote in favour. Some partners opposed the Resolution while most abstained, because of issues which had as much to do with the terms of the Resolution as with the Report itself.We ourselves had some reservations about the terms of the Resolution. We felt that it was premature to be asked to ‘endorse' the Report as a whole and made this clear in our explanation of vote. However, on balance, we decided to support the resolution in order to send a political signal as to the importance that we attach to the report and the issues it raises.While supporting the resolution, we made clear that, like many other States, we will need time to carefully consider the complex political and legal issues involved in some of the very wide-ranging recommendations of this lengthy Report. Our vote in favour does not pre-empt that consideration, or mean that we will necessarily agree with every word in the Report. Its recommendations intentionally have the potential — which I welcome — to set new benchmarks in international legal accountability for military actions, and for that reason require the most careful political and legal consideration by all States. This will not be a speedy process.It is not for the Government to conclude if the Report's findings are accurate as to fact: that will be the task of the investigative and judicial mechanisms it calls for. Nor do we have information of our own on which to make a judgement. But clearly the Report marshals a strong case to be answered.In the first instance, the Report calls for all sides in the conflict to establish authoritative and transparent investigations into the allegations, and we fully supported that call, which was the main operative effect of the General Assembly Resolution. The possibilities of action by international courts, or national courts under universal jurisdiction, are among the alternative measures suggested if those local investigations are not held.The conflict in Gaza has served to exacerbate many of the problems already facing Gaza, including in the environmental sphere and related issues of sewage treatment and the availability of drinking water. While the conflict did involve some additional destruction to the infrastructure in both areas, the main problem is the continuing blockade of construction materials which is preventing the urgent action necessary to avoid huge environmental problems. I have repeatedly stressed the urgent need for an end to the blockade and a full opening of the crossing points to Gaza to normal commercial and humanitarian traffic, and movement of people, and I repeat that call today.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	835	The former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, announced a £5 million endowment to create the Tony Blair Chair of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool in June 2007, at the time of former Prime Minister Blair's departure from office. The Chair was created by the Irish Government in recognition of Prime Minister Blair's instrumental role in the Northern Ireland peace process.The endowment was awarded to the University of Liverpool in recognition of the world-leading research, teaching and promotion of Irish studies carried out by its Institute of Irish Studies. The Institute was founded in 1988 as a result of recommendations made following the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 for a dedicated academic body to research and teach Irish Studies. Since its inception, the Institute has played a key role in developing and informing peace programmes in Northern Ireland and has worked closely with the British and Irish Governments during the peace process.As well as establishing a professorial Chair of Irish Studies, the endowment funding also supports capacity building in the Institute for Irish Studies, including through provision for several postgraduate studentships.The consolidation of peace in Northern Ireland is a policy priority for the Government. The deepening and strengthening of British-Irish relations and the support for projects fostering lasting reconciliation and mutual understanding remain key elements of this process. The endowment was also significant in ensuring the future development of the Institute as a leading centre for Irish studies and was an important commitment of resources to the future of Irish studies in Great Britain. The fostering of Irish studies in Universities internationally is an important part of ensuring that Irish culture and heritage can be studied by future generations.    The budgetary allocation for the endowment was provided for in Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and the endowment funding was paid in 2008.Vote 28, of course, is separate from Vote 29 which funds the Government's development aid programme. In 2008, Ireland's total overseas development assistance amounted to €920 million, of which €768 million was provided for from Vote 29. This was an increase of €49 million on the total overseas development assistance funding of €871 million in 2007, of which €726 million was provided for from Vote 29. The decrease in the overseas aid budget to which the Deputy refers took place in 2009.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	836	Earlier this year I received representations from members of a group called the "West Papua Indigenous Organisation", a group seeking self-determination for West Papua.  West Papua is no longer a United Nations Trusteeship. Following the departure of the Dutch and a brief period of UN administration, Indonesia took over the administration of Papua (formerly Irian Jaya) in 1963 and it became a province of Indonesia following a UN-supervised ‘Act of Free Choice' in 1969, the legitimacy of which is disputed. Proposals to divide the region into three provinces in 2003 fell through. However, two provinces, West Irian Jaya (now referred to as West Papua) and Papua Province, have since been created and this division was legitimized by a decision of the Constitutional Court, which argued that despite the illegality of its formation, West Irian Jaya (now West Papua) was de facto a functioning province. The government subsequently issued a regulation on 16 April 2008 which clarified the status of the province of West Papua and put it on an equal footing with that of the province of Papua.   Despite being rich in natural resources, Papua and West Papua are the least developed areas of Indonesia and their populations are the poorest. Grievances against the central Government remain strong, particularly in relation to the implementation of the Law on Special Autonomy, enacted in 2001, which, at least on paper, provides the region with wide-ranging political authority and generous revenue-earning provisions. Other problems faced by the people of West Papua relate to interaction with the security forces in the province; the influx of migrants from other Indonesian regions; under-development in infrastructure, education and health; and the perception of neglect of the province by the central authorities.Together with our partners in the EU, Ireland respects the territorial integrity of Indonesia and is committed to a united, democratic, stable future for the country. We believe that the most productive approach to dealing with the situation in West Papua, including the situation in relation to human rights issues, is through dialogue with the Indonesian Government. In this context, we have encouraged the Government to seek peaceful solutions in conflict and potential conflict areas in Indonesia, including West Papua. We have also raised issues relating to the human rights situation there.We will continue to urge full implementation of the Special Autonomy Law for Papua. We recognise, however, that the Law was established prior to the division of Papua into two provinces and that this has resulted in major problems in its implementation. Ultimately the central Government needs to provide a legal foundation for the province of West Papua and the Special Autonomy Law should consequently be revised. In this respect, we welcome the commitment of the President of Indonesia, Dr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, to promote the accelerated development of the region through the implementation of the socio-economic aspects of the Special Autonomy Law. We hope that real progress will be made during his second term in office which has just begun.I will continue to monitor the political situation in Indonesia. Human rights issues are regularly raised in discussions with the Indonesian authorities and, together with our EU partners, the Government will continue to take every opportunity to raise concerns regarding Papua in contacts with them. I am delighted in this respect that an EU-Indonesia Human Rights Dialogue was launched at the EU Foreign Ministers' Troika meeting with Indonesia in Jakarta on 9 November last. Ministers agreed that the first working session in the Dialogue should be held during the first half of next year. They agreed also that it should be forward looking, constructive and focus on concrete cooperation in the protection and promotion of human rights.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	839	As the Deputy will be aware from my previous replies to him on 16 September and on 20 October, I am aware of this case and we have been following it closely, through our Embassy in Tehran.    Following his arrest at his home on 9 July and his subsequent appearance at one of the televised show trials, Dr Kian Tajbakhsh was sentenced on 20 October, reportedly on allegations of espionage and playing a role in the public unrest which followed the disputed June Presidential elections in Iran . Unfortunately, like many of those arrested in the aftermath of the protests, Dr Tajbakhsh's future situation remains uncertain. There is even some confusion about the extent of the accusations against him and indeed the precise length of his sentence. His lawyer was only in a position to confirm that the sentence is in excess of 12 years. However, there are some indications that it may be as lengthy as 14 or 15 years. Dr Tajbakhsh remains in detention in Tehran, as he awaits a date for his Appeal.His case continues to be dealt with actively by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents US interests in Iran. We understand that he has had limited access to his lawyer and to his family. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the situation in Iran, post-election, remains tense and complex and the legal system to which Dr Tajbakhsh is now subject is both opaque and slow to proceed. Many hundreds continue to remain in detention in Iran and it is still not clear when, and by what process, these will be properly tried or released.The US has raised this case directly with the Iranian authorities in the context of the dialogue which began at Geneva on 1 October. It was to be hoped that progress in that wider diplomatic engagement, which Ireland supported, would have had a positive impact on Dr Tajbakhsh's case. However, latest indications are that prospects for an early agreement on the nuclear issue would appear to be receding.  It was to be hoped that progress in that wider diplomatic engagement, which Ireland supported, would have had a positive impact on Dr Tajbakhsh's case. However, latest indications are that prospects for an early agreement on the nuclear issue would appear to be receding. Given his dual US nationality, the progress of Dr Tajbakhsh's case seems likely to be caught up in the development of the wider US-Iran relationship for some time to come.The EU has been vocal in its reaction to the deterioration in human rights generally in Iran since the disputed Presidential elections, with a particular focus on the maltreatment of those in detention and the need for due legal process to prevail. Ireland has strongly associated itself with the expression of these concerns. Senior officials of my Department have met with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland on several occasions since the June elections, to convey my strong concerns on these matters to him.The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to bring these matters, and the case of detainees such as Dr. Tajbakhsh, to the attention of the Iranian authorities. We will also avail of the opportunity to express our concerns about the marked deterioration of human rights in Iran, both nationally and in an EU and international context, as we did most recently in discussions at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, the General Affairs and External Relations Council and the European Council. Ireland has, along with EU Partners, also co-sponsored a resolution on the human rights situation in Iran at the current UN General Assembly session in New York.

The Ambassador to Italy is also Ireland's Permanent Representative to the Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), all international organisations based in Rome.The overall operating budget figures for each Embassy as detailed below relate to: salaries, travel, post and telecommunications, office machinery, office premises expenses and incidental expenses.In regard to Embassy premises: the Embassy to the Holy See is owned by the State, where the Chancery and Ambassadorial Residence are combined in a single building. Premises expenses, as detailed below relate to the maintenance of the building.    In the case of the Embassy to Italy, both the Chancery and the Residence are rented properties and the premises expenses figures primarily relate to these rental costs. The Residence is rented on favourable terms as the Irish State has rented the property for over fifty years. The Chancery is rented on a long term lease having moved into its current premises in 1996.It should be noted that there is no possibility of combining either the premises or Ambassadorial duties of these two Missions, as apart from having very different purposes, the Vatican will not accept the accreditation of an Ambassador who is also the Ambassador to the Italian Republic and neither will they accept the accreditation of an Embassy with the same address as the Embassy to the Italian Republic.Embassy to ItalyEmbassy to the Holy See2008 Operating Budget€1,873,034€763,3792008 Premises Expenses (these figures are included in overall operating budget above)€528,865€139,242Current Staff Numbers*8 Locally employed staff

The purpose of these Funds is to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and efforts to create better understanding between people on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, and to assist local initiatives aimed at tackling sectarianism. Details of the guidelines and application process for the two Funds are available on the Department's website (www.dfa.ie ).The two Funds do not provide grants for capital expenditure or building work, including preservation work. The majority of funding is used for programme work in support of reconciliation and anti sectarianism initiatives.

The meetings have taken the form of informal breakfast meetings with, on average, 13 people in attendance. The first meeting was held in April and focussed on the emerging markets in Latin America. The second meeting, which took place in July, concentrated on Science, Technology, Innovation and International Education. The most recent meeting took place earlier this month and focussed on the Irish Crafts Sector and how my Department can best help to promote it internationally.  Each meeting brought together representatives of State Agencies, private sector companies and relevant Government Departments.  It is anticipated that the next meeting of the consultative mechanism will take place in early 2010.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	843	The situation in Zimbabwe continues to be of great concern to the Government and to the European Union as a whole. While we have seen some improvements in the economic sphere in recent months, this has not been matched in other crucial areas, including respect for human rights, the rule of law and security sector reform.Areas of particular concern include the continued failure of President Mugabe to address the issue of senior government appointments in a manner consistent with the Global Political Agreement (GPA). The retention of Gideon Gono as Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and Johannes Tomana as Attorney General is detrimental to the interests of the country; their removal is vital to the building of confidence among international donors and investors.Other causes of ongoing concern are the continued farm invasions, delays to the land audit provided for in the GPA, the failure to reform laws to allow for meaningful press freedom, the lack of progress on security sector reform and the abuse of the judiciary including politically motivated arrests. The continued intimidation, harassment and violence directed against political activists and members of Zimbabwean civil society are of grave concern. The most recent crisis concerned the arrest and indictment in early October of the MDC nominee for Deputy Minister for Agriculture on treason charges and culminated in the disengagement by the MDC from their Zanu-PF partners in government.Zimbabwe's neighbours have a critical role to play in encouraging reform, and can bring the greatest influence to bear in achieving progress in implementing the power sharing agreement. In that regard, the recent summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), who are the guarantors of the GPA, committed both parties in the unity government to enter talks on the full implementation of the GPA. This is a positive development and, with our EU partners, we will continue to support any such efforts to secure full implementation of the GPA and a unity government that delivers on the promise of reform.Ireland has worked closely with our EU partners in developing a consistent approach to Zimbabwe. In keeping with other international donors, we do not provide funding to the Zimbabwean Government, but respond to the humanitarian needs of the Zimbabwean people through support for the work of multilateral and non-governmental organisations. Thus far in 2009, Ireland has committed funding of over €5.24 million to a range of humanitarian programmes in Zimbabwe, focussed on food security, tackling HIV and AIDS, human rights and supporting civil society organisations who provide essential services for the population. While the re-opening of political dialogue with the EU represented a step in the right direction, this dialogue has now stalled. The EU has repeatedly stated its willingness to re-engage with the Zimbabwean Government. Re-engagement, however, remains conditional on the agreed goals set out in the GPA being met. These include restoration of the rule of law, commitment to the democratic process, and respect for human rights. We will continue to monitor the situation and press the inclusive government to fulfil these obligations.

The SIDOs were appointed on two-year contracts to provide opportunities for persons with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity.A network of 33 LSPs have been set up throughout the country by the Irish Sports Council (ISC) to coordinate and promote sport at local level especially amongst specific target groups such as older people, girls and women, people with disabilities, unemployed people, and those who live in identified disadvantaged communities.  The special dormant accounts funding was in addition to the annual funding provided to the LSPs by the ISC for programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.  The ISC has allocated €6 million to the LSPs in 2009.  The continuation of the SIDO scheme from 2010 will be dependent on the outcome of the 2010 Estimates deliberations.

The submission will be considered in the context of policy responses for the tourism industry as a whole, as well as the general economy, in the forthcoming budget.I consider that there are real opportunities to grow Ireland as a food tourism destination and I recognise the potential to greatly enhance the experience of tourists visiting Ireland through the provision of good food and enjoyable dining experiences.  Under section 8(1)(a) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion or development, including promotion of particular sectors such as food tourism, are functions of Fáilte Ireland. Insofar as Food Tourism is concerned, Fáilte Ireland is leading and working with Government Departments, Agency partners and Industry stakeholders, including the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI), to position Ireland as one of the world's outstanding authentic food tourism destinations and to position Irish Food Experiences at the core of Ireland's Tourism Brand.  Sustainable development is crucial to success and Ireland's reputation as a green and natural island will be explored as part of the strategy development.The depth and variety of food-based tourism products that Ireland has to offer is being highlighted and supported by advertising the wide range of food festivals taking place around the country. Examples include a Taste of Dublin, a 'Taste of Ireland' Food Festival as part of the Derby Festival at the Curragh, the Connemara Lamb Festival and the Waterford Food Festival. Fáilte Ireland is also recognising and promoting excellence in the sector through sponsorship of a number of awards including the Georgina Campbell Best Breakfast award and the RAI awards initiatives.Fáilte Ireland is also supporting a number of trade groups including the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Good Food Ireland, the Fabulous Food Trails and the Whiskey Trail to assist them in furthering their activities in this area. Support is being provided in the form of direct marketing supports as well as "in-kind" supports in the form of reductions in fees for training members of groups in areas such as developing menus and in improving online capability.To assist businesses in becoming more effective and efficient, Fáilte Ireland is providing a range of business support services. These supports include a Business mentoring and coaching service, a Business advisory service, the Optimus programme and Performance Plus — online business tools. Fáilte Ireland also provides restaurant sector specific supports including:A chefs workshop programme: sweat the menu, reduce the cost and savour the profit,A front of house productivity programme andA quality food toolkit CD resource.

This research is now feeding into the development of a natural heritage strategy, part of which is focussed specifically on ecotourism.Ecotourism is one of the themes for the new Tourism Learning Networks, which are being run on behalf of Fáilte Ireland in 2009. In January 2009, Fáilte Ireland, in association with the Greenbox project, launched an "Ecotourism Handbook" which is a practical guide to both existing tourism businesses and those who wish to start new businesses.Fáilte Ireland is committed to the promotion of high standards in environmental practice across all sectors of tourism.  In this context, it has recently contracted for the establishment of a ‘green label' for tourism, which would be available to tourism establishments.Failte Ireland has also been involved with a group in the Burren to establish it as a destination for ecotourism.  This project involves training in environmental standards, certification and the development of a holistic ecotourism experience in the area which meets the needs of international consumers, as highlighted in recent research.During 2010, Fáilte Ireland intends working with other industry groups in the development of sustainable environmental practices and ecotourism experiences.In relation to upgrading staff skills and management capacities, I am informed that, in 2009, Fáilte Ireland is providing training for 6,000 students/trainees across a range of craft based programmes.  Fáilte Ireland is also providing funding to ten Institutes of Technology and the DIT to facilitate the training of 2,047 students in skills and supervisory areas, up to Further Education & Training Awards Council (FETAC) 6.Fáilte Ireland has a range of capacity building programmes designed and delivered specifically to meet the development needs of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and microenterprises (MEs). These programmes take the form of peer learning networks, seminars, workshops, mentoring and coaching sessions. It is expected that approximately 6,200 senior managers and owner/managers of tourism enterprises will benefit from these programmes in 2009.The Renewed Programme for Government includes a commitment to position Ireland as an important international cultural tourism destination.In relation to developing niche cultural tourism markets with globally recognised branding, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, in association with the tourism and arts bodies and cultural institutions under its aegis, is engaged in a Cultural Tourism Initiative, which is building on cooperation and synergy between these bodies.  The aim is to enable Ireland to more effectively market cultural tourism and address the needs of overseas and domestic tourists who wish to experience Ireland's cultural and artistic resources.A Steering Group, consisting of representatives of the Department, State tourism agencies, cultural institutions and State arts organisations was established to identify and pursue specific actions in line with the goals of the Initiative.  Actions taken to date have included more cohesive integration of marketing arrangements for cultural attractions, and the development of downloadable audio guides.  The Cultural Tourism Initiative is also working with the Irish Film Board to encourage the use of locations of cultural value in Ireland as venues for film and television production.The Initiative will be reviewed at the end of 2009 in order to decide what further actions may be necessary. Fáilte Ireland have progressed a number of new initiatives in this area over the past 12 months, including the further development of the traditional culture experience, the further development of the literary tourism experience and the marketing and awareness of our cultural offering.In addition, the development of cultural tourism markets is also being advanced by the marketing of the national cultural institutions, the promotion of Culture Night in September to a wider number of towns, and progress being made in relation to major national cultural projects such as the Druid in Galway, the Limerick City Art Gallery in Limerick, the Niland in Sligo, the Waterford Theatre Royal and the re-development of the National Concert Hall.Culture Night was held on 25 September 2009 in 11 cities and towns.  The cultural institutions remained open until late in the evening thereby encouraging people of all ages and from all backgrounds, from both Ireland and abroad, to experience a wide range of cultural activity.

Both the 1999 and 2002 grants have been drawn down in full.Grant allocations are subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which include, for allocations above certain specified thresholds, the execution of a deed of covenant and charge.  This places a charge on the grantee's title to the property and is intended to protect the taxpayer's investment by ensuring that the facility remains in sporting use for at least 15 years.  The Department's legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO), deals with the grantee's solicitor in executing this Deed. I understand that the CSSO has written to the Department on 23 November stating that the legal requirements in respect of the grant in question have been completed.  Following receipt of this notification, the Department will write to the organisation in question seeking the submission of an up to date tax clearance certificate for the grantee with a view to issuing formal approval.  When formal approval is received by the grantee in question, it will be a matter for the club to submit valid, paid invoices which in turn will be submitted to the Office of Public Works for certification in advance of payment of the grant.

Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of September 2009, the transfers to the DAF have totalled some €513.90m.  Funds reclaimed since April 2003 total some €181.27m.The value of the DAF at the end of September 2009, net of liabilities, was some €49.76m.  This figure excludes €46.47m maintained in a Reserve Account to meet future reclaims by account holders and to cover expenses associated with the operation of the DAF.The process in place with regard to support from the DAF provides for consideration of applications received on foot of advertised measures.  The only Dormant Accounts application processes involving this Department in 2009 concerned the Dormant Accounts Additionality Measure in RAPID areas. The priorities for the 2010 Programme will be considered over the coming months.The overall objective is to ensure that dormant accounts funds are disbursed in a manner that optimises their effectiveness.  To achieve this objective, the key underlying principles seek to promote additionality, take into account government policies and priorities, support programmes or projects that can make a demonstrable difference and can achieve discernible impacts, ensure good value for money, display a clear and identified.  It is also necessary for promoting groups or organisations to demonstrate that they are capable of undertaking and managing the project and funds should be disbursed to projects or programmes that are sustainable.With regard to funding for breakfast clubs, I understand that the Department of Education and Science in conjunction with the Department of Social and Family Affairs address the current provision of school meals.  As this is currently a mainstreamed programme, the principle of additionality, from the DAF could only be met where disbursements are for purposes that are additional to and not a substitute for mainstream government spending. Any additions to the current school meals programme would be a matter in the first instance for the Departments of Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs.

As outlined in that response, I am very concerned at the proliferation of headshops and I have raised these concerns in many fora.  My concerns in relation to the selling of substances that are represented as being "legal highs" or "herbal highs" centre on the potential health hazard arising and the fear that use of these products may act as a gateway to the use of illicit drugs.The matter has been discussed at the first meeting of the Oversight Forum on Drugs, set up under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, in October.  This Forum, which I chair, is comprised of representatives, at senior level, from the various parties involved in the implementation of the Strategy.Also under the Strategy, I have had meetings in recent weeks with the Minister for Health & Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality & Law Reform and headshops were among the issues considered.  I also discussed headshops at meetings in the past two weeks with the Garda Commissioner and senior Revenue officials.Under the new National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 it is proposed (i) to monitor the activities of headshops, and all businesses involved in the sale of psychoactive substances, with the objective of ensuring that no illegal activity is undertaken and (ii) to ensure that steps are taken to reform legislation in this respect where it is deemed to be appropriate.  Meanwhile, An Garda Síochána and Revenue's Customs Service are working to ensure that no illegal substances are sold in these premises.

In 2009 to date, my Department expended €15,092 on the translation of such documents, as well as a total of €26,069 on the associated printing costs.With regard to the wider context, my Department has worked, and will continue to work, with Departments and other public bodies to assist them in meeting their translation obligations under the Official Languages Act in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible.  In addition, I wish to again reiterate that the obligation under section 10 of the Act to publish documents simultaneously in Irish and English applies only to a limited number of key documents published by public bodies, including annual reports and accounts and documents setting out public policy proposals.I have long advocated that documents such as these should be published by way of CDs or the internet, rather than hard copy.  This is the general rule that my own Department now follows and I am aware that a number of other public bodies also adhere to it. Indeed, the Coimisinéir Teanga specifically advocates this approach to public bodies in the guidebook on the Act that his Office published and circulated in 2008 and the Government adopted a similar policy last year as one of a number of measures designed to reduce costs across public bodies.Name of State DocumentCost of translating into IrishCost of printing€€Statutory Instrument re: Island Transport Services63391Statutory Instrument re: Western Development Commission Superannuation Scheme*1,109RAPID information leaflet for the ploughing championships97NilDepartment of Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs’ (DCRGA) Appropriation Account 200884NilDCRGA Annual Output Statement 20093,000NilDCRGA Annual Report 20081,252NilIrish Language Scheme 2009-20121,050NilInvitation to the 2009 National Famine Commemoration130553Programme booklet for 2009 National Famine Commemoration1261,504National Drugs Strategy 2009-20169,29022,512Total 2009 to date15,09226,069*The cost of translation was not incurred in 2009.

The means by which legal recognition will be effected may include legislation and in any event will require careful consideration and consultation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	862	Child benefit is a monthly payment made in respect of qualified children to assist in the costs associated with child rearing and in the alleviation of poverty in larger families.  Currently the standard monthly rates of child benefit in respect of single births are €166.00 in respect of each of the first and second child and €203.00 for the third and subsequent children.In addition, with regard to multiple births, parents of twins are paid child benefit at one and a half times the standard rate for each qualified child. Child benefit is paid in respect of multiple births of triplets or greater at double the normal monthly rate for each qualified child. Furthermore a special grant of €635.00 is paid in respect of multiple births at the birth and further grants of €635.00 when the children reach age 4 and 12 years. These higher payment rates of child benefit are in recognition of the additional costs associated with multiple births.As you will be aware, the rates of Child Benefit have increased significantly since 2001, having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children.Partly as a result of this, and partly as a result of an increase in the number of eligible children, overall expenditure on Child Benefit grew from just u under €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008.The Government was able to direct substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years. However in view of the current economic crisis, the Government has had to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances. Excessive borrowing and an unsustainable increase in the national debt will hamper our ability to fund social services, including welfare, in the future. We must find an appropriate balance between protecting the most vulnerable people in the short term and taking necessary action to avoid prolonging our current economic difficulties.It is in this context, that the Government is considering how savings might be made in Child Benefit. We are considering a range of options, including, but not limited to, those set out in the reports of the Commission on Taxation and the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.The Government has not yet made a final decision on the future of Child Benefit payments including the level of payments in respect of twins/multiple births. I can assure the Deputy that in considering this issue, we are mindful of the needs of families that have come to rely on their Child Benefit income. Our final decision will be outlined on Budget day.

Expenditure levels for the Department are being considered as part of the estimates and budgetary process for 2010. All social welfare schemes are being examined as part of this deliberative process.Improvements to the back to education scheme were announced in the April supplementary budget and came into effect from 1 st May 2009. In general, in order to qualify for participation, an applicant must now be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course. The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to 9 months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department's facilitator programme. People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme. A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.The back to education allowance has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseeker's. The fact that over 18,700 applications had been approved by the end of October, compared to 11,646 participants in the 2008/2009 academic year, demonstrates the increased level of interest in the scheme. The conditions of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of its objectives and changes in the economic climate.

Neither I nor the Department has any function in relation to decisions on individual claims.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.To qualify for rent supplement a person must satisfy a number of conditions including that they must be a bona fide tenant, be habitually resident in the State, have a housing need and satisfy a means test.  Also, the Health Service Executive must be satisfied that the accommodation is suited to the persons needs and the rent payable is within the prescribed limits.The timescale for determining applications for rent supplement is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements, information from landlords etc.  In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.Under existing arrangements, an appeal against a decision on entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance or rent supplement is made in the first instance to a designated appeals officer in the HSE.  A person may, if they so wish, make a further appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, if they are dissatisfied with the decision of the HSE appeals officer.The Executive does not maintain records that would readily provide the information requested by the deputy.  However, in response to the deputy's query, the Department has surveyed the community welfare service concerning the average processing times for rent supplement decisions and appeals. Figures supplied to the Department indicate that, for the eastern region, it takes between two and twelve weeks to process a rent supplement claim, with the average duration being between three and four weeks.  The HSE's Appeals Office in the eastern region has stated that it takes an average of ten weeks to decide on a rent supplement appeal.The social welfare appeals office does not distinguish between supplementary welfare allowance appeals and other supplements such as rent supplement. The average time taken to process an appeal to the social welfare appeals office is estimated to be 8 weeks approximately.The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the Executive. However, this has to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the demands of natural justice and the need to ensure that every case is fully investigated.  While certain cases may take more time to process than others, overall, I am satisfied that the Executive makes every effort to decide rent supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner.

Many recipients pay more than €24 because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have, over and above the appropriate rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance, towards their accommodation costs.The Executive has advised that the person concerned is in receipt of her full entitlement to Rent Supplement based on her income from One-parent Family Payment, Part-time Earnings and Maintenance.

This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.An application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received by the Department on 23rd June 2009. This application was referred to one of the Departments Medical Assessors who found that the child in question was not medically eligible for Domiciliary Care Allowance.A letter issued to the person in question on 7th August 2009, in which she was advised of the decision to refuse Domiciliary Care Allowance on medical grounds. In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor specially designated for this task.Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

The Order sets out the basis on which the Society shall be governed. It provides that there shall be a Central Council which shall exercise the powers of the Society, organise the Society and control and manage the affairs of the Society. Membership of the Central Council is by way of appointment by the Government or by election in accordance with the rules of the Society. The Central Council in turn elects an Executive Committee.The number of Government appointees is governed by the Order as being not less than one third of the total membership of the Central Council. One of the Government appointees is an official from my Department.Most recently, I have been informed in broad terms of the proposed governance changes which will shortly be presented to the Central Council. When my Department receives the formal report from the Society as to its proposed restructuring it will then be subject to interdepartmental and inter agency discussion. Thereafter I will bring before Government any statutory changes deemed necessary.  While industrial relations are, in the first instance, a matter for the management of the Society, I am not aware of any industrial relations difficulties within the Society.

My Department has taken a number of steps to address this issue and to promote the sale of these units, including increasing the limit for local authority loans.  However, in the current market conditions sale is not always possible; accordingly, in order to avoid leaving properties vacant for lengthy periods, my Department has provided a number of alternative options for authorities to consider in ensuring that the units involved are deployed for other housing purposes, including the temporary transfer of units for use under the social housing leasing initiative.It should be noted, however, that it is not intended that such transfers will result in the units concerned being added automatically to the permanent social housing stock.  All units transferred will retain their affordable housing status and, accordingly, authorities have been advised that the option for sale of properties, either as affordable housing or under the incremental purchase scheme, is to be retained in all units approved for transfer to social leasing, and that such units should be allocated where possible to households who have indicated that they have the means and aspiration to purchase these units in the future.The issue of compliance with planning permission is a matter for the relevant local authority.

A programme of work to install water meters for all non domestic users will be completed by the end of 2009.  A waste water charge is levied based on the water in/water out principle, an internationally recognised approach for charging for waste water services.  The consolidated charge is levied on non domestic customers who are in receipt of both water and waste water services from the local authority.The Department does not hold any information on the number or percentage of customers that have opted for one service only.  A charge for water, only, would arise where a customer is connected to the public water supply but is not connected to the local authority's waste water infrastructure.Details of the consolidated water and waste water charge for each local authority area for 2009 are set out in the following table.ChargeCarlow2.30Cavan2.51Clare2.98Cork City2.35Cork2.16Donegal2.31Dublin City1.64Dun Laogh/Rath.2.34Fingal1.94South Dublin1.76Galway City1.60Galway2.07Kerry1.66Kildare1.49Kilkenny2.94Laois2.45Leitrim2.28Limerick City2.30Limerick2.60Longford2.40Louth1.95Mayo2.26Meath2.65Monaghan2.11Offaly2.90Roscommon2.12Sligo2.30North Tipp.2.40South Tipp.2.00Waterford City2.35Waterford2.66Westmeath2.38Wexford2.71Wicklow3.04

The Act is structured with a starting position of a universal liability for residential property in respect of the charge.  It then exempts certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most significant exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.Other exemptions include buildings that are newly constructed but unsold and which form part of the trading stock of a business; buildings with heritage merit; buildings let directly or indirectly by local authorities for social housing purposes or which are the subject of a shared ownership arrangement with a local authority; buildings let by voluntary bodies; and buildings in respect of which commercial rates are payable.  In addition, an exemption applies where a person purchases a property for use as a principal private residence, provided that that person disposes of the original property within six months of the annual liability date, and where a former spouse has an interest in a property following a divorce or separation but no longer resides there.  Exemptions are also included for a situation where a relative of the owner lives rent-free in a property, as long as the property is within two kilometres of the owner's residence, and where a person is forced to vacate his or her home through long-term physical or mental incapacitation.

The draft Bill proposes to give statutory effect to the recommendations of the Working Group that had been established to review the management of dog breeding establishments. The Working Group recommended that a dog breeding establishment be defined as ‘a premises containing more than 5 female dogs, aged over 4 months, with breeding potential'.The draft Bill proposes that all dog breeding establishments be required to register with the relevant local authority, that they pay a registration fee and that they meet a minimum set of veterinary, welfare and other standards, together with some associated requirements. It is also proposed to amend a number of the existing dog control provisions.The Hunting Association of Ireland (HAI) made submissions to me in relation to their activities and the nature of these. As a consequence and in recognition of the "not for profit" basis of these activities, and as communicated to the HAI directly and in response to representations on their behalf, I decided to provide exemption in the legislation in respect of the payment of registration fees. The HAI has made clear that their premises operate in accordance with comprehensive and appropriate standards. Accordingly, I do not consider that this aspect of the legislative regime should cause difficulty to their members.Regulations made under the Control of Dogs legislation will also be amended on foot of such revised primary legislation.I intend to publish a draft Bill as soon as possible.

It follows, therefore, that a building that is not habitable is exempt from the charge.  While the Act does not define what might constitute a habitable, building, my Department has issued guidelines to local authorities to assist in the application of this provision.  Local authorities have been asked to consider factors such as the building's structure — if it has a sound roof and whether it is affected by damp — and the availability of services such as sanitary facilities and a water supply when considering whether or not a building is suitable for use as a dwelling.

The authority has indicated that the library in Belturbet is its number one priority for funding.Following detailed consideration of the priority lists submitted by all local authorities, a limited two-year Capital Programme for Public Libraries was announced, amounting to €8.5 million in 2009, which will contribute towards the development and refurbishment of a range of public libraries throughout the country.Unfortunately, it was not possible to allocate funds to Cavan County Council for the Belturbet project at that time in view of the limited capital funds available, the high level of applications from library authorities across the country and the focus, in 2009, on ensuring deliverability of those projects which were assisted in this programme. The Belturbet library project, along with a number of other applications, will remain under consideration for capital funding over the lifetime of the Programme should additional funding become available.

An evaluation was made on the basis of circumstances, or a combination of circumstances, which might result in Dublin City Council not being in a position to meet the volumetric contractual commitment which forms part of the public private partnership agreement in respect of the facility and thus being required to meet the cost of the capacity not then being availed of. The projection was based on an assumed shortfall of 180 ktpa and an assumed penalty of €100 per tonne to arrive at a potential exposure of €18m per annum assuming that the shortfall continued indefinitely and/or it proved impossible to re-negotiate the provision in the agreement or sell-on some or all of the capacity to a third party at a rate which might offset in whole or in part the liability which would have arisen.

Due to changes in methodology, it is not possible to provide comparative data for earlier years.Regarding the trend in homelessness nationally, indications in that regard can be obtained by reference to the number of households assessed in the triennial statutory assessments of housing need as requiring social housing due to homelessness.  The results of the triennial assessments are published in the relevant Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library and on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.Regarding action to address homelessness, I refer to the reply to Question No. 119 of 14 October 2009, which outlined action being taken under the Government's Homeless Strategy and the associated Implementation Plan.The issue of homelessness, including relevant risk factors, has been the subject of extensive research both in Ireland and internationally.

In relation to drinking water, the EPA published its annual report on the provision and quality of drinking water for the period 2007-2008 in April 2009.  The report contains the results of monitoring data for 2007 and highlighted that overall compliance with drinking water standards in 2007 was 97.2%.The EPA published a report on urban waste water discharges in Ireland for population equivalents greater than 500 persons for the years 2006-2007 in July 2009.  This report sets out the result of monitoring data in this two-year period and indicated that while 90% of waste water receives secondary treatment, or better, the overall compliance rate for treatment plants was 31%.  A significant proportion of the non compliance was due to inadequate sampling by the local authorities.Compliance with the relevant standards for both drinking water and waste water treatment standards is a key priority for my Department.  Since 2007, I have strengthened the regulatory regime governing both drinking water and urban waste water.  The European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 prescribe quality standards to be applied and related supervision and enforcement procedures in relation to supplies of drinking water.  Under the Regulations, local authorities are responsible for the supervision of group water supplies, while the EPA is responsible for the supervision of public water schemes.The Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations, 2007, provide for an authorisation system for all wastewater discharges to waters from treatment plants or collection systems owned or controlled by local authorities. Introduced on a graduated basis since 2007, local authorities may not cause or allow discharges from wastewater facilities except in accordance with EPA requirements.Continued capital investment in water services infrastructure is critical to achieve increased compliance with the relevant standards for drinking water and waste water.  There has been significant progress in delivering improved water and waste water infrastructure under my Department's Waste Water Investment Programme since the monitoring periods covered by these reports.  My Department has allocated €500m in capital funding for 2009 under the Water Services Investment Programme.My Department works closely with the EPA and the local authorities to identify actions needed to resolve issues relating to the operation of drinking water and waste water treatment plants.  A key priority has been to address drinking water schemes which appear on the EPA's remedial action list. These are schemes identified as being at the risk of not complying with drinking water standards.  All local authorities have been asked to provide the EPA with a summary of the action programme being implemented to address such schemes by 30 November 2009.My Department also chairs the Water Services Training Group which is responsible for identifying and delivering appropriate training to local authority personnel involved in the delivery and operation of water and waste water services.

The 2009 capital provision is €500 million, of which an estimated €270 million will be spent on the provision of drinking water supplies.  The operational costs for local authorities in providing water and wastewater services in 2007, based on the Annual Financial Statements for that year (the most recent year for which audited information is available), was €646 million.Local authorities charge non-domestic customers for the water services they provide while the operational costs of domestic water services are funded from the General Purposes Grants from the Local Government Fund.  The total General Purpose Grants allocated to local authorities in 2009 exceeded €900 million.

The latest figures available to me indicate that a cumulative figure of 8,595 households have transferred to private rented accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  Based on this figure, inclusion of these RAS dwellings in the charge would result in an additional income of approximately €1.7 million.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	899	The Environmental Protect Agency is responsible for compiling the national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland and for reporting these to the European Union and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  These inventories are compiled on an annual basis using the good practice guidelines established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The results become available in preliminary form about 11 months after the end of a calendar year, and they are then finalised and submitted as required to the EU and to the UNFCCC over the following 5 months.The National Inventory Report 2009, which reports on actual emissions in 2007 and previous years, is available on the Agency's website (www.epa.ie).  Preliminary greenhouse gas emissions data for 2008 are expected to become available from the Agency towards the end of 2009.  Data for 2009 will not be available until late 2010.The Agency also has responsibility for developing annual national emission projections for greenhouse gases (GHG) for all key sectors of the economy, in collaboration with relevant State and other bodies. Emission projections serve to inform national policy initiatives, such as the annual Carbon Budget, and allow Ireland to comply with EU reporting obligations on projections (e.g. Council Decision 280/2004).  The Agency produces GHG emission projections annually as this allows the most recent environmental and other policy developments to be taken into account as well as updates to key assumptions (such as revisions to anticipated economic growth).The Agency released projected emissions figures in March, 2009, updating  those published in September 2008, and taking account of the sensitivity analysis used in the ESRI's Economic Shock scenario, which assumed that GDP will contract by 8% between 2007 and 2010, grow by 33% between 2010 and 2015 and 25% between 2015 and 2020.Based on this, the Agency has projected that, with full implementation of all announced emission reduction measures, the "distance to target" for Kyoto compliance will now be between 1.3 and 1.8 million tonnes per annum over the 2008-2012 period.A report entitled Ireland's Greenhouse Gas Projections 2008-2020 is available on the Agency's website (www.epa.ie).
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	900	I do not accept the premise on which this question is based: there is no failure to meet the targets set under the Kyoto period 2008-2012. The National Climate Change Strategy signalled the possibility of supplementing greenhouse gas emission reductions with the purchase of up to 3.6 million carbon units on average each year in the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012 or 18m units in total costing €270m, at a projected unit price of €15.  Use of the flexible mechanisms available under the Kyoto Protocol provides a valid means towards meeting the legally binding targets.Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency has been designated as purchasing agent for the State and in 2008, the Agency purchased 3.455m certified emission reduction units at a cost of some €52m. To date in 2009, they have purchased 1.8m units at a cost of €21.6m. No carbon units were purchased in 2007.In December 2006, my Department entered into an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to invest €20 million for the purchase of carbon units in the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund. The investment was made in 2006 on foot of a once-off provision from the Department's vote.In January 2007, prior to the designation of the National Treasury Management Agency as purchasing agent, my Department committed €10 million each to the Carbon Fund for Europe and the BioCarbon Fund operated by the World Bank.  Management of these investments is a matter for my Department and, since enactment of the 2007 Act, payments are made by the Agency through the Carbon Fund process as they arise. In 2008, my Department refunded €3.72m to the Carbon Fund in respect of these investments in the World Bank. Further payments of €1.9m to the World Bank have been made to date in 2009. Periodic drawdowns are a feature of these investments. The amount to be paid each year is not predetermined and in general payments will be made as purchasing transactions progress.These investments with the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are expected to yield some 3m carbon units at a projected cost of some €26m during the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012. The monies invested in actual purchases or committed to international carbon funds are therefore expected to yield in total, some 8.3m units in the 2008 to 2012 period, at an average cost of about €12 per unit.The economic downturn has implications for the purchasing programme. The most recent EPA projections suggest that with full implementation of all announced emission reduction measures the purchase requirement for carbon units will now be between 1.3 and 1.8m units per annum or between 6.5m and 9m units in total over the 2008-2012 period.   In the circumstances, the National Treasury Management Agency has been asked to put its purchasing programme on hold for the foreseeable future.Ireland is on course to meet its targets for the Kyoto period with significantly fewer carbon credit purchases than had been envisaged originally.  Purchasing requirements to ensure Kyoto compliance are being kept under review and will be revised as necessary in the light of future projections. If it transpires that more credits have been bought than are needed in the 2008-2012 period, they can be carried forward for use after 2012 in the next commitment period.

Earlier this year, following an extensive consultation process, which incorporated the receipt of 235 submissions, the General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was prepared in my Department and approved by the Government.  The Noise Nuisance Bill is included in the Government Legislation Programme published on 16 September, 2009.The issue of noise nuisance caused by intruder alarms was raised in many of the submissions received. Measures to tackle this problem, including through the issuing of fixed payment notices, are currently being considered by the Department in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.

This includes newly-established businesses.Under the provisions of the Local Authority (Rates) Act 1970, it is open to a local authority to make and carry out a waiver scheme in respect of rates payable to it by ratepayers generally or any class of ratepayers.  Any such scheme requires the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  However, any reduction in or waiver of rates in respect of some ratepayers is likely to result in a local authority being forced to increase the rates burden on other ratepayers in order to make up the shortfall.

There is then a further month's grace period to pay the charge, giving a total of three months during which the charge may be paid before penalties for late payment commence.  Given this length of time and the relatively modest nature of the charge, I do not consider that an instalment payment plan is merited in this case.

This Directive became law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations, 1999.   Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009, specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for the following pollutants:sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead  (2002);carbon monoxide and benzene (2002);ozone (2004); andpolyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air (2009).Benzene, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury are all carcinogenic.Where the indicative level for any pollutant is exceeded, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 require the local authority concerned, following notification by the EPA, to develop a long-term air quality management plan to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants.The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants through its website: http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data/. My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report on Air Quality in Ireland 2008 (September 2009). This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2008 based on data from 30 monitoring stations. In addition there were a further 18 monitoring stations operated by local authorities to measure black smoke. The Report did not identify any area in the country where ambient air quality is exceeded and confirmed that Ireland is in compliance with the air quality standards in force for all pollutants.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	921	I propose to take Question Nos. 458 and 459 together.Government policy in relation to waste management is grounded in the internationally recognised hierarchy of waste options. The most favoured option is waste prevention, followed by minimisation, reuse, recycling, recovery and the least favoured option of disposal to landfill. This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive to divert waste from landfill. Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.The Programme for Government agreed in 2007 included a number of objectives relating to waste management, among them a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and to act on the conclusions.  An important milestone was reached recently with the delivery of the report of consultants engaged to carry out a study to underpin the conclusion of the review. This report will act as a launching pad for putting in place the policies that we now need to mark a new departure in our approach to waste management. I intend to develop a new policy statement on waste management arising from the recommendations in the report, which I shall bring to Government as soon as possible in 2010.  This will set a policy context which will ensure that waste management services are delivered by the public and private sectors in an environmentally progressive and cost efficient manner.Also, in conjunction with the launch of the report, I announced increases to the landfill levy to drive waste from landfill in order to meet the challenging EU targets. The levy will increase to €30 per tonne by 2010, to €50 in 2011 and to €75 in 2012. This will have the effect of driving our waste higher up the waste hierarchy. These charges should not increase costs to consumers. We have seen significant drops in landfill gate prices in recent years, but no comparable drop in waste charges.Combined with changes to the way the waste market is organised and by continuing to alter our approach to how we manage our waste through the rationalisation of waste services this should ultimately lead to a more cost efficient service for users of public and private waste management services.

Annual allocations to local authorities for House Purchase and House Improvement lending totalling almost €31m were notified to local authorities in July, an increase of €9m (or 40%) on the 2008 allocation of almost €22m.  It is important to note that these allocations represent borrowings ceilings rather than financial provisions. Since the allocations were made, a further €2m has been allocated to those local authorities who sought increased lending capacity for 2009.  No set borrowing limit has been put in place for the Home Choice Loan scheme.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	924	The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has for many years worked towards assessing the extent of the radon problem in Ireland. In July 2008 the RPII published the results of a three-year baseline study on the exposure of the Irish population to ionising radiation, which includes radon. This report, Radiation Doses Received by the Irish Population, is the most comprehensive assessment of radiation exposure ever undertaken in this country.The Report found that, as is the case in the majority of other countries, radon is the principal source of radiation exposure in Ireland, representing over 56% of the dose received by the Irish population. In terms of reducing our exposure to radiation radon is the area where the greatest impact is possible.Since 1998 the Building Regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004 an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) was published incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This guidance document is aimed at ensuring that radon protection measures are carried out more effectively.In relation to houses built before 1998, the Government's approach, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate on awareness-raising. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary. The RPII, in partnership with local authorities and the Health Service Executive (HSE), has carried out targeted information campaigns in high radon areas and in some instances where areas of particularly high radon levels have been found they have written directly to householders in these areas. This encourages householders to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department: Radon in Buildings — Corrective Option. The RPII has also issued guidance: Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide. In addition, the website of the RPII provides a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and can offer specific advice and recommendations.The Scheme of Housing Aid for Older People is available to assist older people, generally over 60 years, to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out to their homes. Where a suite of works is being grant aided under this scheme, local authorities may also, as part of the package of works, assist with the provision of radon remediation works, where applicable.My Department has already given approval to a number of local authorities to undertake, on a sample basis, radon surveys of their housing stock in high incidence areas. In addition, the RPII have directly contacted local authorities with known areas of high radon concentration to encourage them to test local authority housing stock for radon and, where necessary, to take remedial action. A number of local authorities are already taking action in this regard and it is intended to build on their, and the RPII's, experience in this area.Members of the public can access information on radon on the RPII website, www.rpii.ie. Publications and information leaflets about radon can be downloaded free of charge. The RPII can also be contacted on freephone 1800 300 600.On Thursday, 19 November, 2009, my colleague Michael Finneran, T.D. Minister for Housing and Local Services opened Ireland's Seventh National Radon Forum in the Royal College of Physicians, Dublin. The theme of the Forum was "towards the development of a radon control strategy for Ireland". The aim of the Forum, in addition to raising public awareness, was to provide the opportunity for those with an interest in radon to meet and discuss issues of mutual interest.My Department will continue to work closely with the RPII, the HSE, local authorities and other interested agencies to raise public awareness and to promote radon testing and remediation works. This multi-agency approach to dealing with radon is in line with international best practice, as recommended by the World Health Organisation's International Radon Project which was co-funded by the Irish Government.

For the purposes of this reply, ‘State documents' are being interpreted as core corporate documents, statements of policy and strategy documents, and do not include leaflets, application forms, posters and similar publications.As set out in the Department's Irish Language Scheme 2009-2012, the Department undertakes to provide bilingual versions of these core publications preferably in the one cover (either hardcopy or electronic publications). However, where the length of any bilingual publication would reduce its effectiveness or involve excessive additional cost, separate Irish and English language versions are provided. It is not the intention of the Department to translate large documents which are of a technical nature or have a small circulation.The Department has made a significant investment in the preparation, design and maintenance of both the English and Irish Language versions of its core website (www.environ.ie). A dedicated ‘Publications' area has been designed where electronic copies of all publications, in both languages, are hosted and available for the public to download.  In line with the Department's environmental policies, every effort is made to limit where feasible the use of paper and printing, and increasing amounts of the Department's publications are now only printed on demand. Overall, the Department is committed to monitoring and gauging the level of demand for its services in the Irish Language by carrying out annual audits of its Scheme and a review of measures undertaken.The total cost of translating the 26 ‘State documents' as described above since 2008 has amounted to €39,299.

While a householder is free to choose which measures to install in his or her home, the householder must undertake works attracting grant payments of at least €500, not including the BER grant.The scheme, which is open to all householders in homes built before 2006, is stimulating the upgrade of a significant number of homes to the optimum standard achievable and to date approximately 31,000 households have been grant approved.All works carried out under the scheme are underpinned by a comprehensive Technical Specification and Code of Practice for contractors which ensure that works undertaken represent best value for each homeowner's investment and also best value for all public monies expended.In general, all products used must be fit for purpose, improve the energy efficiency of the building and have no detrimental impact on the structure, viability, quality or safety of the property.  All insulation products must meet relevant product standards. One underlying objective of this Scheme is to put in place materials that will achieve a level of performance in the home, equivalent to the standard required in the most recent update of Part L of the Building Regulations.  Thus, the objective for Wall Insulation is in as much as is physically and economically feasible, achieve a U-value of 0.27 W/m2K for external walls.  The inability of a homeowner to commit to undertaking works to the requisite specification would preclude their qualification for the grant.Contractors must ensure that, in the case of insulation, an optimal whole-surface solution is provided where physically and economically feasible e.g. this comprises internal or external insulation of all walls exposed; or in the case of roof insulation that this comprises insulation of the whole surface of the ceiling/roof-space as appropriate.  All grant applicants are required to use a Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) registered contractor and in applying accept that their application relates to works which are economically and physically practicable and which will secure the optimal energy efficiency improvements to its home.Partial works are only accepted in very exceptional circumstances e.g. where it is not physically possible to provide complete roof insulation coverage due to small inaccessible areas of the roof, or where a home may require significant additional modifications over what would normally be expected and that such modifications would make the initial investment inappropriate compared to the benefit the homeowner will get out of the investment.  Where only part-home coverage is achieved, this must be detailed in the Declaration of Works (grant request) and the contractor must inform the customer that this may impact on their ability to draw down support from the scheme.Taking this approach ensures that the homeowners gets best value for their money and that the Exchequer gets best leverage for its investment.

Phase I of this Programme was aimed at facilitating the delivery of broadband services in cities and towns that did not have broadband at that time.  The Government approved the building of the Phase I MANs in March 2002.  Phase I has so far delivered optical fibre based networks to twenty-seven towns and cities throughout the country.  All twenty-seven are operational and open for business.A further ninety-four towns, with populations in excess of 1,500, were identified as locations for MANs under Phase II of the Programme on the basis that there was no DSL broadband available from the incumbent service provider in each of the locations.  The Government approved the building of the Phase II MANs in November 2003.  Fifty-nine of these MANs covering sixty-five towns have been completed to date.  The Kinsale MAN is due to be completed in quarter two of 2010.Bray, Wicklow and Arklow were not included under Phase II of the MANs Programme as DSL broadband was available in all three towns at the time of the Government decision.

I have no direct involvement in that process.  The Gate process, which is run by the CER working with EirGrid, is designed to streamline the connection process.The current Gate 3, was the subject of extensive public consultation by the CER prior to its final decision in December 2008.  In keeping with the Government target of 40% of electricity consumption to be from renewable sources by 2020, Gate 3 provides for almost 4000 additional megawatts of renewable generator connection offers.The CER and EirGrid have calculated that around 5800MW of renewable capacity will be required to deliver the 40% target in 2020.  There are currently 1,400 megawatts (MWS) of renewable generation plants connected to the electricity grid.  Currently, there is approximately a further 1400 MWs of capacity in additional projects, which have received connection offers and which have been accepted into the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) programme.  These projects were part of the Gate 1 and Gate 2 processes, and will typically be built and connected to the grid over the next two or three year period.The question of developing projects beyond the Gate 3 process will depend on the level of take up by developers and on the roll-out of the transmission grid to safely and securely accommodate steadily increasing amounts of intermittent power generation.The projects in Gate 3 were selected by the CER on a "first come first served" criterion.  Connection offers are scheduled to issue between late 2009 and early 2011.To ensure this process operates efficiently and transparently, and to keep the industry stakeholders informed of the ongoing work, the CER has established a Gate 3 Liaison Group involving all stakeholders, including the renewable industry associations.  The objective is to ensure the connection offer process is completed as quickly and as effectively as possible.

As part of this energy efficiency drive, the Government has also committed to achieving a 33% energy saving across our public sector institutions by 2020.On 8 May this year I published the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) which sets out  90 actions that Government is either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the national energy efficiency targets.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately €1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.Together with Minister Gormley I launched the National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery earlier this year.  The Programme entails a three pronged approach to addressing the legacy of older housing with poor energy efficiency standards.The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retro-fitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.  A list of eligible measures and fixed grant rates is set out in the following table:MeasureFixed grant rate€Roof Insulation250Cavity Wall Insulation400Internal Wall Insulation2,500External Wall Insulation4,000High Efficiency Boiler with Heating Controls Upgrade700Heating Controls Upgrade Only500Building Energy Rating Assessment200The Warmer Homes Scheme also provides support for low income housing for insulation and other energy efficiency improvement measures.  This scheme is managed by SEI and implemented by local community groups.  Measures include cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  These measures are provided free or at a nominal cost to the householder.  Advice is also provided on minimising energy use.Some €20 million has been made available to the Warmer Homes Scheme in 2009.  This represents a very substantial increase on previous years and the WHS is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes this year.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also set aside some €25 million for two initiatives designed to address thermal inefficiencies in local authority dwellings.  Of this, €20 million has already been allocated to local authorities to improve the energy efficiency of dwellings and apartment complexes, to a BER standard of C1.  €5 million has been set aside to support a number of demonstration projects that will achieve a BER rating in excess of C1 and will inform the future improvement of the overall local authority stock.In the business sector, the greatest cost-cutting and energy saving potential lies in improving the energy performance requirements of new non-residential buildings, improvement of existing buildings, encouraging more businesses and public bodies to actively address their energy use and to use the most energy efficient plant, machinery and equipment.In an effort to realise this potential, Sustainable Energy Ireland launched in 2009 a €6 million programme that offers grant assistance to the business and public sectors.  The programme allows important cost-cutting energy efficiency measures to be installed at significantly reduced cost to businesses across the country.   Over 80 projects are currently underway under the programme.  As a result of the work carried out, annual savings are expected to be approximately €2.6 million, alongside 12kt CO2 reductions.A dedicated support programme has also been established by SEI offering free energy management training, advice and support to any business that is willing to show a commitment to becoming more energy efficient.SEI's Large Industry Energy Network also engages all of the largest energy using enterprises (in manufacturing and services) where the 120 member companies collectively spend over €800 million p.a. on energy.  Recently published analysis shows that by spending €1.9 million these large companies avoided energy costs of €60 million in 2008 alone.Government has also extended the Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme to take account of additional categories including energy efficient IT infrastructure and electric vehicles. The Scheme allows businesses to make the right economic decisions that will support ongoing savings whilst increasing cash-flow in the year of purchase.  Companies can now write off the full capital cost of energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase.  The ACA scheme currently covers equipment accounting for at least 60% of the energy used by industry in Ireland.The Public Sector Energy Efficiency Programme is designed as the main delivery mechanism for coordinating and encouraging energy efficiency actions by our public sector bodies.  It is providing free energy assessments of up to 400 public buildings in 2009.  It is providing professional advice on energy management and energy efficiency improvement measures and aims to train 150 public sector building managers this year.  SEI is also developing best practice guidance materials and facilitating specialist workshops on matters such as public street lighting, water services, and ICT.Regulations are currently being finalised in my Department that will include new energy efficient public procurement rules and these will be in place in the coming months.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on SEI's database of highly energy efficient products.  This database was developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme for energy efficient technologies.SEI is also tasked in these regulations with producing general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and these will be progressed in conjunction with the new OPW National Public Procurement Office.I am also currently finalising proposals to bring to Government on a new Programme — the Energy Demand Reduction Target (EDRT).  The EDRT programme will involve the promotion of energy services by energy companies in Ireland. There is significant potential to further reduce energy costs and related greenhouse gas emissions in homes and business across the country whilst creating employment and developing a market for energy services in Ireland.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	933	The Government has set a target of 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020.  Electricity accounts for approximately one-third of energy consumption in Ireland, with another third of energy consumption in the transport sector and a further third in the heat sector.  The 40% target for renewable generation is consistent with the EU target addressed to Ireland under Directive 2009/28/EC to increase the contribution from renewable sources to 16% of all energy consumed (to include electricity, transport and heating) by 2020.  Renewable generation contribution made up 11.9% of all electricity consumed in 2008 compared to just 4.4% in 2003.  Ireland has an EU target of 13.2% for renewable electricity to be achieved by 2010, which will be met and probably exceeded. The promotion of the sustainable generation and use of energy is being supported in a variety of ways in the electricity, transport and heat sectors, as well as through the promotion of energy efficiency across the economy.Renewable electricity generation is currently supported through the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) programme which has been in operation since 2006.  There are currently 1,400 megawatts of renewable generation plants connected to the electricity grid and wind powered technology is the dominant technology.  More than 100 individual wind farms have been connected with a combined capacity of around 1100 MWs. 240 MWs of hydropower are connected.  The balance represents biomass plants mainly landfill gas.  There is approximately a further 1400MWs of capacity with signed grid connection offers, which are due to be built and connected to the grid typically over the next two to 3 year period.  Furthermore, under the Gate 3 process being run by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), a further 4000MW of additional renewable electricity capacity is due to receive connection offers over the next 18 months.The current REFIT scheme supports wind, small hydro and biomass generation.  REFIT is being expanded to cover offshore wind, ocean energy and anaerobic digestion/CHP.  The estimated cost of REFIT when State Aid approval was obtained from the European Commission in 2007 was €150 million over a period of 15 years.  The Government has a target of 500MW from Ocean Energy, by 2020.  Ireland's Ocean Energy Strategy is being overseen and implemented by the Ocean Energy Development Unit in Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) working in partnership with all key players.  Ocean energy technologies are still in the research and development phase globally.  Work towards the commercialisation of ocean energy technology continues in Ireland and abroad. The Government was set a target for Renewable Heating of 12% by 2020.There are a number of schemes in place to support the target including the Greener Homes Scheme (which supports domestic renewable heating), the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme, which is aimed at institutional, industrial and retail users of heat, and the Combined Heat and Power Programme (CHP).  The cost of the Reheat and CHP programmes in 2009 is estimated at €5.2m while the cost of Greener Homes is estimated at €15.3m.  Biofuels offer one potential means to counter high emissions levels in the sector.  The Government is committed to the sustainable development of an Irish biofuels market in line with overall EU biofuel policy developments.  The National Biofuel Obligation, from next year, will provide the market with long term stability and will incorporate the EU Commission's Guidelines on Sustainability Criteria, as soon as these are published.  As a result of the Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes, introduced in 2005 and 2006 (the schemes are valued at over €200 million), the market penetration rate for biofuels as a percentage of road transport fuels has increased from zero to just under 2% in 2008.The Government has committed to achieving 20% energy savings across the economy by 2020.  As part of this energy efficiency drive, the Government has also committed to achieving a 33% energy saving across the Public Sector by 2020.  I launched the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) in May 2009.  The Action Plan sets out 90 actions that the Government are either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the energy efficiency targets whilst reducing our CO2 emissions by approximately 5.7 million tonnes.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately €1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.

The target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, will equate to around 225,000 cars on Irish roads.  An Inter-Departmental/Inter-Agency Taskforce on electric vehicles is chaired by my Department and comprises the Departments of Transport, Finance, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), ESB, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is also joining the Task Force in light of its statutory responsibilities for the regulated networks.  ESB Networks has a pivotal role to play in terms of delivering the necessary infrastructure and charging points roll-out of electric vehicles.  Both my Department and I are liaising closely with ESB Networks on progressing the infrastructure programme.  ESB is also playing a lead role in the work of European energy utilities and other players to ensure standardisation across Europe.

The programme will provide up to 4,000 domestic customers investing in micro-scale projects with a financial payment for electricity exported back to the grid.  The ESB advise that 92 customers had signed up for the scheme by September 2009.  The microgeneration programme also provides for two-way metering, to be installed without additional charge to the customer.  The electricity producer is paid a price of 19 cent per kilowatt-hour, which will help to offset the start up costs.  The micro technologies in question include wind, solar and hydro as well as combined heat and power.  It is the case that micro-scale electricity production will benefit the participating customers upfront by offsetting their purchase of electricity from their electricity suppliers.  I have asked my Department to develop the microgeneration framework further to enhance and facilitate take-up.Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has also launched a Micro-generation Pilot Programme, involving research and field trials, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis, of micro-scale projects.  The field trials will address a range of issues including grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.  Full details of the field trials, the criteria for applications, the involvement of the different technologies and customer groups and the exact level of support are available on of the SEI website (http://www.sei.ie/Grants/Microgenpilot).  40 applications have been approved to date.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	939	While global energy costs have declined over the last year, Irish energy costs remain a significant concern for all sectors of the economy, having risen significantly above EU average in recent years.  This is primarily due to structural factors including Ireland's high dependence on imported fossil fuels, geographic isolation, a small and widely dispersed population and programmes of very significant investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment in the networks.  Recognising the concerns of indigenous business and the inward investment community, the Government has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the cost of energy for business.  All electricity users benefitted in 2009 from direct subsidies totalling €567m.  These were made up of an ESB rebate to consumers of €315m, a repayment of certain Public Service Obligation (PSO) levies of €87m and the deferral of some ESB network revenues until after October 2009.In July the Government agreed that these subsidies will continue for large energy users at their current level until October 2010 and will then be phased out over the following two year period.  In line with this Government decision, the ESB Board has agreed to pay a special interim dividend which is being used in the interests of the economy to fund the continuation of subsidies from October 1st 2009 to September 30th 2010.  This special interim dividend is in addition to the dividend in 2009, which will be payable by ESB into the Exchequer in 2010 in accordance with the general dividend policy agreed between the Ministerial Stockholders and ESB in the context of the Strategic Framework to 2020.  Consistent with previous dividends from the company, including the dividend paid by ESB in respect of 2008, current dividend policy is for a continued rate of 30% of profits after tax.

I worked closely with my EU Ministerial colleagues in the Energy Council and Commissioner Piebalgs throughout last year to reach agreement on the Renewable Energy Directive.  The outcome, agreed in December 2008, sets an excellent framework for delivery on Europe's renewable energy objectives and was satisfactory from Ireland's perspective.Under the new framework Directive covering the electricity, heat and transport sectors each Member State must achieve a binding individual national target by 2020 with the aim of contributing to the overall EU target of 20% of renewable energy consumption in the EU energy mix by 2020.  In the transport sector, a minimum target of 10% of renewables (including biofuels and electric vehicles) is set for each Member States.  The best way to reduce Ireland's potential exposure to any speculation in global fossil fuel markets is to significantly increase the use of renewable energy sources and deliver on energy efficiency improvements.

To achieve this my Department promotes the planting of new forests through a range of attractive support measures — the Afforestation Grant Scheme, the Forest Environment Protection Scheme and the Native Woodland Scheme.  These schemes provide 100% establishment grants and annual premiums for up to 20 years.In addition, my Department also provides supports towards the provision of forest infrastructure such as harvesting and management roads, along with grants to encourage forest owners to actively manage their forests and improve the quality of the final crop.  Funding has also been provided for enterprises involved in the production and supply of wood fuels to the commercial and domestic heat sectors.

However, entitlement to compensation is conditional on owners/keepers complying with the provisions of the Disease of Animals Act 1966, any Orders made under this Act and other national or EU legislative requirements relating to movement, identification and other controls laid down under the disease eradication schemes.  In this instance, the herd owner concerned was restricted on the 3 April 2009.  However, there are substantial unresolved discrepancies with regard to testing and registration requirements in the herd in question.  My Department has written to the person concerned on a number of occasions and is in regular contact with him regarding these matters.  While progress has been made in the last year, there are still a considerable number of issues outstanding and it is hoped that, with the continued co-operation from the herd owner concerned, the remaining discrepancies can be cleared.  Compensation will continue to be withheld until the matters concerned have been resolved.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	948	Statutory Instrument No. 14 of 2008, European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2008 gives effect to a series of European Directives concerning the protection of animals including Council Directive 98/58/EC of 20 July 1998 which lays down minimum standards for the protection of animals bred or kept for farming purposes.  Among the issues covered in Council Directive 98/58/EC is one relating to freedom of movement which requires that an animal not be restricted in such a way as to cause it unnecessary suffering or injury and where an animal is continuously or regularly confined, it must be given the space appropriate to its physiological and ethological needs in accordance with established experience and scientific knowledge.My Department has an inspection regime in place, which requires that all farm enterprises be inspected regularly to ensure compliance with national legislation.  Mink farms are among the farm enterprises that are inspected regularly by Veterinary Inspectors of my Department and the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence.  Farms are inspected to assess compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes.  Inspections on these farms have to date, found that the farms are operating in compliance with current legislation.High animal welfare standards are an essential component of modern farming and Ireland was among those member states that earlier this year supported the adoption at EU level of a Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare.  The Deputy will be aware that under the renewed Programme for Government there is a commitment to phase out fur farming over three years and my Officials are currently assessing the legislative changes required to give effect to that commitment.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	953	The disposal of fallen animals is subject to EU Regulations, notably Regulation (EC) No 1774 of 2002.  These regulations require that animals which die on-farm must generally be disposed of through approved knackeries and rendering plants.  My Department's contribution to the Fallen Animals Scheme ceased with effect from 14th April 2009.  This was as a result of budgetary constraints and also reflects the greatly reduced incidence of BSE in this country.  However I have continued to provide financial support for the collection of certain fallen animals, in particular bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national BSE surveillance programme.With the ending of the Fallen Animals Scheme the cost of collection and rendering for animals not covered by the new scheme became a matter for negotiation between the individual collectors/rendering plants and their customers.  My Department is continuing, within the boundaries of legal requirements, to make every effort to facilitate measures to maximise flexibility and enable reduction of costs in the rendering/collection system.  This includes allowing cross border trade, permitting direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants, considering removal of some costs currently built into the rendering process and encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal (MBM) for energy purposes.Approval conditions have recently been drawn up to facilitate the collection of fallen animals direct from farms by approved rendering plants, including arrangements to provide for TSE testing of these animals where required.  Discussions are also ongoing between my Department and farmer and hunt representatives, to consider the feasibility of extending the network of plants authorised to act as knackeries.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	954	The Foreshore and Dumping at Sea Amendment Bill now before the Oireachtas will transfer certain foreshore functions from my Department to the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In addition, the Bill will transfer responsibility for the Dumping at Sea Acts to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Other than the transfer of functions, there are no significant amendments to the Acts contained within this Bill save for the modernisation of certain phrases and references.  Plough dredging is regulated by the Dumping at Sea Acts as is dumping of dredge spoil at off shore locations,My Department is fully conscious of the requirement for County Councils and Harbour Authorities to carry out dredging on a regular basis, and in all cases every effort is made to expedite the issue of the appropriate Dumping at Sea permit subject to the approval of the Marine Licence Vetting Committee.  In particular, Dumping at Sea permits have been issued to Donegal County Council to facilitate maintenance dredging at Buncrana Harbour on a number of occasions, most recently in July of this year.  This permit remains valid until the end of December 2009.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	955	The holding of the person concerned has been restricted since 2 April 2008 following a post mortem check on animals sent for slaughter which disclosed TB infection in two animals. A TB skin test was carried out in May 2008 on the animals remaining in the herd and a further 9 reactors were identified.  Further tests in the herd have resulted in a total of 25 reactor animals being removed.  Compensation due under the TB On Farm Market Valuation Scheme has been paid in respect of all animals removed from the herd in question.  With regard to the Income Supplement scheme, herd owners who have animals removed as reactors may, subject to qualification criteria, also be considered for additional compensation payments under this Scheme where disease breakdowns results in the removal of more than 10% of animals in a herd and where depopulation is not appropriate.In breakdowns of this nature, the calculation of reactor numbers removed is based on the herd tests that takes place following the disclosure of infection as a result of the post mortem tests.  Therefore animals that disclosed infection in the context of the post-mortem check are not included in that calculation because those animals were not removed as reactors by my Department.  With regard to the calculation of the number of animals in the herd to be taken into account for this scheme, the position is that eligibility is based on the number of animals presented for the first herd test following the disclosure of the lesions and not  the number of animals in the herd at the time of the disclosure of the lesions.  On that basis, the number of animals removed to date is not in excess of the 10% threshold and the herd owner concerned was advised by the DVO in a letter dated 16 October 2009 that he is ineligible under the scheme at this time.  The TB eradication compensation scheme provides an appeal process for herd owners which allows appeals to be submitted to my Department and, should that appeal be unsuccessful, there is an option to appeal the decision to the Agricultural Appeals Office.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	956	My Department had analyses conducted at the Irish Equine Centre on samples of imported poultry this year. This was specifically in the context of the gas flushing of poultry meat.  The results of these analyses are presently being assessed and any follow-up action, including dissemination of information, that is considered necessary will be taken.  My Department is working in close liaison with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on this matter.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has issued guidelines on the handling of gas-flushed poultry.  The safety of food being marketed in the EU is controlled through a far-reaching range of veterinary legislation.  Compliance is monitored by the competent authority in the country of production.  Once food, including poultry meat, is fit for human consumption it can circulate freely within the Union.  There are also extensive controls on products imported from third countries.  Such products must have originated in a country approved by the EU for trade, have been produced in an approved establishment, be appropriately labelled and transported and be landed at an approved border inspection post.  The appropriate  veterinary health certificate, verifying conformity with animal and public health requirements, must accompany the consignment.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	957	While animal feed protein derived from non-GM crop varieties is available on the world market, protein feed materials derived from non-GM soya and maize are more expensive than their GM counterparts.  This is due to reduced cultivation level of the non-GM varieties, and the extra costs associated with ‘identity preservation’ i.e. the process of segregating non-GM from GM crops.  While the additional costs for protein feed materials derived from non-GM soya and maize vary according to the state of the commodity markets and the nature of demand, Irish feed industry sources suggest that there is currently a significant price premium for non-GM soya ex Brazil.  Over 95% of imported soya and maize by-products, used as protein feed materials for Irish livestock, are declared as having been derived from authorised GM crops.  My Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children is examining the introduction of the new voluntary food GM-free logo as provided for in the Programme for Government.

I have, however, made provision of €9.75 million in 2009 to meet the existing commitments under the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme and the preceding equivalent schemes.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	959	There are 5,594 County Galway farmers in the Suckler Welfare Scheme.  These farmers had 75,887 animals eligible for payment in 2008.  The number of animals payable for 2009 will not be known until all the measures have been completed and all the information has been returned by the farmers and processed by my Department.  Under the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, 3,485 farmers in Co.Galway have been affected by the reduction in the maximum payable area to 34 hectares, resulting in a cumulative reduction of €2.8 million in their payments.  However, 8,750 farmers have not been affected by this reduction in the maximum payable area.Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to protect expenditure for major developmental measures in the agrifood sector.  To achieve this objective, savings had to be found in other areas and I decided, reluctantly, to reduce expenditure under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme for 2009 by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares.  However, notwithstanding the reduction in funding, the total amount available under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme in 2009 is €220 million.  This represents a substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best-funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	960	The introduction of electronic identification (EID) for sheep was agreed at EU level in late 2003. At that time, it was agreed to defer the implementation date until January 2008. The Council revisited this issue in December 2007 when it was agreed that the deadline for the compulsory introduction of EID should be set for 31 December 2009, 6 years after the original decision was taken.  I have no discretion as regards the date of implementation.  I have always had the greatest reluctance in relation to the mandatory introduction of EID.  My consistent view has always been that the introduction of EID of sheep should only have been introduced on a voluntary basis.  There is, and always has been, a lack of sufficient support from the other EU Member States or from the European Commission for a voluntary scheme.In the discussions in Brussels, a number of measures have been negotiated intended to minimise any inconvenience in its introduction.  In particular, provision has been made to exempt from EID, lambs under 12 months of age and that are intended for slaughter.  This means that the vast majority of Irish sheep will not be affected by the EID requirement.  Primarily only those animals retained for breeding over the coming years would have to be electronically tagged and so the additional costs to farmers in any given year are being kept to a minimum.  Given that 70% of Irish flocks have less than 100 sheep, the vast majority of farmers will have a maximum additional annual cost of €30.If EID is largely confined to replacement breeding stock in 2010 it is likely that no more than 450,000 sheep will be subject to EID.  The additional overall cost is estimated to be approximately €700,000.  The European Commission for its part has estimated the cost of an electronic identifier to be within the range of €1-€2.  It is my intention that the scheme to be introduced during the course of next year will be implemented in consultation with the stakeholders and will take appropriate account of Irish conditions.

The basic legal requirement is that animals which die on farms must generally be disposed of through approved knackeries and rendering plants.  Burial of fallen animals is only permissible under licence in remote areas i.e. islands and listed mountain or bog land areas.  Farmers who wish to bury animals on-farm should apply to their local District Veterinary Office for a burial licence.

As with all agri-environmental schemes, payments in REPS are justified on the basis that they compensate farmers for income lost and additional costs arising from their undertakings.  There is also provision for a small "transaction cost".  My officials are currently in discussions with the European Commission on a new agri-environmental scheme and it is my intention that farmers leaving REPS will be able to apply for it.

When the Early Retirement Scheme was suspended it became apparent that there were a certain number of farmers who had their preparations to apply for the Scheme completed or close to completion at that point.  Consequently, I took the decision to re-open the Scheme temporarily on 23 September 2009 with limited additional funding with a view to accepting as many as possible of the applications that fell into this category.  My Department received a further 175 applications up to the closing date of 30 October 2009.  These applications are currently being examined.

The Milk Quota Trading Scheme has been very successful on both fronts.  Since its inception, the Trading Scheme has allowed more than 2,800 sales of quota to be conducted, accounting for the trade of 375 million litres of quota.  This means that the Trading Scheme has facilitated about 2,000 quota holders in exiting from milk production at a market rate of return for their quota that has typically been far in excess of anything they could have achieved under its predecessor, the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme.In providing this attractive means of exit, the Trading Scheme has ensured that quota has moved smoothly from those no longer wishing to remain in milk production to those who can use that quota to make their dairy enterprises more efficient.  Most importantly, those seeking quota have been able to purchase it in far greater quantities (up to 80,000 litres) under the Trading Scheme than under the Restructuring Scheme, which has been critical to their efforts to increase efficiency.  In this manner the Scheme is contributing to a progressive improvement in the competitiveness of milk production in Ireland.

The grant awards, which are part of a strategy to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the industry, will contribute to total investment in the region of €168 million.  Details of the awards are in Appendix 1.This Beef and Sheepmeat Investment Fund is financed by my Department and managed by Enterprise Ireland. The selection of projects followed careful assessment and evaluation by an expert committee comprising members from Enterprise Ireland, my Department, Bord Bia, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, private industry and academia.  The investment will support increased scale and efficiency in primary processing, and added value in further processing for retail, food service and manufacturing outlets. No overall increase in processing capacity within the sector is envisaged.  The fund is expected to achieve over €400 million in additional sales and exports, and a net expansion of 800 in employment following its completion in 2012.

In excess of €19 million was spent on the Programme in 2008 and in 2009 expenditure is expected to be in the region of €15 million.  Funding for the aquaculture and fish processing sectors is covered under the National Seafood Development OP 2007-2013. A draft OP was advertised for public consultation in October 2008 as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment.During the consultation both the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on behalf of the Central Fisheries Board raised concerns regarding the granting of aid to projects where environmental issues arise relating to compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and sea lice control on salmon farms.  The Department is in close liaison with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the European Commission with a view to agreeing an approach that will give the necessary assurances on the concerns raised that can facilitate the approval of the National Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013.The Decommissioning Scheme which was launched in February 2008 has led to 46 vessels being decommissioned and €36.6m paid to vessel owners over 2008 and 2009. In total 6,913 GTs and 19,356 kWs have been taken out of the Irish sea-fishing fleet which means a greater share of quotas for those remaining in the industry.  The Decommissioning scheme is now closed.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	976	My Department and its agencies working with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has developed a comprehensive plan to deliver compliance with the EU Birds and Habitat Directives for wild fisheries and aquaculture over a three year timeframe.  A meeting between the Department, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, relevant Agencies and DG Environment took place in Brussels on 13 May 2009 to discuss the plan with a view to securing DG Environment's support for the approach set down in the plan.DG Environment advised at that time that it was, in principle, favourably disposed towards Ireland's plan subject to a positive response to the issues raised and further clarifications from the Irish authorities on the details of the plan.  However, it has more recently advised that it remains concerned about some aspects of the planned approach to delivering compliance for aquaculture licensing.  The most recent views of DG Environment are being examined.  In the meantime a programme of baseline data collection funded by the Department is being undertaken by the Marine Institute.  Appropriate Assessments have been carried out by the Marine Institute in recent months prior to the opening of wild fisheries at Castleisland, Co. Kerry, and Dundalk Bay.The National Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 draft was advertised for public consultation in October 2008 as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment.  During the consultation both the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on behalf of the Central Fisheries Board raised concerns regarding the granting of aid to projects where environmental issues arise relating to compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and sea lice control on salmon farms.  Pending resolution of these issues, the National Seafood Development Operational Programme has not yet been adopted.The Department is in close liaison with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the European Commission with a view to agreeing an approach that will give the necessary assurances on the concerns raised that can facilitate the approval of the National Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013.

Every effort is made by my Department to expedite the determination of all outstanding cases having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all relevant national and EU legislation.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	978	A total of 23 staff are scheduled to transfer from my Department to the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government to facilitate the transfer of functions under the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill 2009.  This number is comprised of 18 administrative staff currently based in my Department's offices in Johnstown Castle, Wexford.  Five engineering staff members are also scheduled to transfer.  The process of selecting engineering staff has yet to be completed.The transfer of these functions will not affect the overall staffing levels within my Department's Fisheries Division in Clonakilty.  Following the transfer of functions as envisaged in the Bill it is expected that there will be scope for internal reassignment of duties which will increase the number of staff working on aquaculture licensing.

Nonetheless, in light of reductions in  budgets combined with increased expectations in terms of places in higher  education there is a shared understanding across the sector of the need to  ensure that maximum value is achieved from existing resources. In that regard  the Higher Education Authority (HEA) is working closely with the institutions  to effect economies across all levels of activity.  The commitment of the  institutions themselves to accommodating current increased demand at a time of  significant budgetary pressures is very welcome.As the Deputy is aware, the process to develop a new national strategy for  higher education is now underway which affords a timely opportunity to review  the environment for higher education and the challenges and changes that are  impacting on the sector.  An examination of the overall operational, governance  and resourcing framework are important elements of the strategy review.  The  process will consider objectives for participation in higher education as a key  aspect of its work.

There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of  which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching  to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.   Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the  Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the  context of the school building and modernisation programme.  However, in view  of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible  to give an indicative timeframe for the progression the project at this time.It is my understanding that the school has a principal's office, a GP room, 7  permanent mainstream classrooms, 2 prefabs sanctioned for mainstream teaching  and 3 prefabs for use as ancillary rooms. It is also my understanding that the  school has 9 mainstream classroom groupings. Therefore the school has a  classroom for each of its class groupings.However, if there is an accommodation shortage at the school in the immediate  short term, the Department grant-aids the provision of temporary accommodation  in respect of schools requiring interim accommodation to cater for additional  staffing allocations while awaiting the provision of permanent accommodation.It is open to the school authority to apply to the Department for temporary  accommodation.

The research will report on the  progression of third level students from March 2008 to March 2009. This report  will be available early in the New Year. Data on the 2009/2010 entrants will  not be available until summer 2010.  In relation to the issue of the student  services charge, the Government has already announced that it is willing to  accept increases of up to €1,500 (from €900) for the 2009/10 academic year in  individual higher education institutions.My Department is actively engaged in a programme of administrative and  legislative reform of student grants. The overall objective of this reform is  to facilitate the introduction of significant service level improvements in the  administration of student grants.In streamlining the process of applying for a student grant, this year, for the  first time, a downloadable application form was made available on the  www.studentfinance.ie website. The Department is actively engaged in the  development of a new, more user-friendly application form for student grants.  It is planned to make the new application forms available a good deal earlier  in the year so that students can submit grant applications following completion  of the CAO process.

This report  suggests best practice benchmarks of 2.7 cubic metres per pupil per year at  both primary and post primary level.In comparing UK figures against anticipated usage in Irish schools, a number of  factors were taken into consideration.  For example, most UK schools have  catering facilities for students, while most Irish schools do not. The UK  school year is also longer than the Irish school year. Consequently the  expectation is a lower best practice figure for water consumption in Irish  schools.An independent report was carried out for my Department on water consumption in  3 schools.  On the basis of the outcome of this report and taking the UK  position into consideration, best practice water consumption was set at an  average of 2.1 cubic metres per pupil.An internal report on Rain Water Recovery in GRD (Generic Repeat Design)  schools was produced by an independent Building Services Consultant. This  report also suggests water usage rates per pupil in each school at just over 2  cubic metres per pupil per year.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has introduced a Water Conservation  Measures initiative as part of the Summer Works Scheme 2010.  The Department  will monitor the outcome of this initiative using its energy website  www.energyeducation.ie.  Best practice usage may change based on the data  collated under this exercise.My Department has feedback from some local authorities on metered water  consumption.  However, it is not its intention to seek comprehensive  information from all local authorities on this issue at this time.I will arrange for additional background information on water usage in schools  to be forwarded to the Deputy.

There are 31,688 PLC places nationwide.Since its introduction in 1985, there has been a steady increase in older  participants (age 21 and over) so that currently PLC participants are about  equally divided between the school leaver cohort and participants who are  older.Applications for places on individual courses are made directly to the schools  and colleges involved.  Following an interview and assessment of suitability,  conditional offers are usually made to applicants around May for courses  beginning the following September.  For school leavers, these offers are  conditional on successful completion of the Leaving Certificate.  This offers a  clear progression route for school leavers and is an incentive towards  successful completion of the Leaving Certificate.

These projects comprise new schools and major extension and refurbishment projects.Any savings in 2009 relating to this is a deferred or delayed commitment. This commitment will now arise in 2010.The progression of any further large scale building projects at this late stage of the year would not result in a spend on the Department's capital budget in 2009.  This action would only result in further commitments for 2010 and subsequent years.  My priority is to progress the current building programme as announced and I will be announcing a further programme for large scale projects in due course.The ICT grant announced by the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, T.D., on 16 November, 2009 is part of an action plan produced by the joint advisory group, which I established to assist with the progression of the integration of ICT in teaching and learning.The plan builds on the earlier strategy group report, 'Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools".Under the grant, every classroom in the country is to get a teaching laptop, software and digital projector over the next three years as part of a €150 million plan for 'smart schools'.  As a first step, €22 million in grants will issue to primary schools before the end of this year of which €13 million is being provided under the School Building Programme.  Funding for post primary schools will be made available early in the New Year.Each school building programme comprises several elements between which the annual budget is divided.  For 2009, these elements include:Large scale building projects;Smaller scale devolved schemes;Temporary Accommodation Scheme;Summer Works Scheme;Energy Efficiency Scheme;Asbestos/ Radon remediation;Emergency Works Grants;Furniture and equipment;ICT Measures.The school to which the Deputies refer has applied for funding under the large scale capital funding heading.Consistent with all such applications, this application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.The project will be considered for inclusion in my Department's 2010 capital programme.  However, due to the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, no commitment can be given for the inclusion of the project in that or any subsequent capital programme.In the meantime, it is open to the school to which the Deputies refer to apply for funding under any of the other headings under my Department's capital budget which I have outlined like the temporary accommodation Scheme or the Summer Works Scheme to address any immediate needs it might have.

I will arrange for the information to be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1013	For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or guardians, dependent mature students or as independent mature students. An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income must be taken into account.  Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference to their parents' income. The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where  appropriate.In order to establish a candidate's status as an independent mature student, documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate's address from 1st October of the year preceding entry to college. In considering whether a mature student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.The documentary evidence normally required by a local authority or VEC to establish independent residence includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas or ESB bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a Government Department. In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to produce such proofs of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable reasons, the awarding authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other documentary proofs. While an affidavit, if accompanied by other supporting documentation, may be considered as evidence of independent living, an affidavit in isolation is not considered acceptable as sole proof of residency.The Deputy will be aware that, in witnessing an affidavit, the role of a Commissioner for Oaths or practising solicitor is to witness the signature of the person making the affidavit. They do not verify the contents of the affidavit. An affidavit is generally confined to such facts as the person swearing it is able of his or her own knowledge to prove. It is considered that it is likely to be of little value where a candidate is unable to provide any form of documentary evidence to support his or her assertions in this regard.My Department has reviewed the use of affidavits in the context of proof of independent living and is satisfied that the current practice in this regard is both reasonable and appropriate.

Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.The school to which the Deputy refers has applied to my Department for capital funding for a large scale extension project.  The application has been assessed in accordance with published prioritisation criteria for large scale projects and assigned a band 1 rating. This rating takes account of enrolment patterns in the school.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme. However, in view of the level of demand on my Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

It is targeted as a support to individual pupils to enable them to attend Protestant schools.I have made clear that I am prepared to work with the Protestant fee-charging schools to identify particular problems and issues that may be arising in some of their schools, or in respect of some students in their schools, and to examine how these might be addressed in a manner consistent with the Constitution.In this regard I have met with Protestant educational representatives, including the Church of Ireland Board of Education; Monaghan Collegiate School; the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland and the Committee on Management for Protestant Schools. In addition, my officials have also met with the Secondary Education Committee. I have explained that a simple reversal of the measures taken in Budget 2008 applicable to all Protestant fee-charging schools and determined solely on a denominational criterion was not legally possible.I believe that engagement between my officials and representatives of the Protestant schools is the best way to seek to resolve the issues that are of concern.

These bodies seek to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications and are paid as soon as possible.Co. Wexford VEC has confirmed to my Department that, contrary to the Deputy's information, 3 members of staff are deployed on a full-time basis, as well as 0.5 of an officer for the peak period and two staff members during the late summer. In addition, a senior member of staff is involved in processing the grants in 2009.The VEC has also confirmed to my Department that the biggest delaying factor in the processing of grants this year is that applicants have submitted incomplete application forms and have not provided the required supporting financial information. These incomplete applications require subsequent phone calls, e-mails and letters, frequently on more than one occasion, before they are fit for adjudication.

The Deputy will be aware, however, that in 2009, aid for school books was restricted to schools that have been included within the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) scheme.  DEIS is the action plan for educational inclusion and focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.This payment was made in the form of enhanced capitation to DEIS schools.  In 2009, over €3.81 million was paid to 673 DEIS primary schools. The enrolment in those schools on 30 September 2008 was just over 102,000 students.At post-primary level, over €3.19 million was paid to 203 DEIS schools, with a combined enrolment on 30 September 2008 of just over 61,000 students.The Renewed Programme for Government provides for funding to be made available to allow schools to provide grant assistance for books.  The precise level of additional grant support will be considered in the context of the estimates and budgetary process for 2010. Schools will be advised of the arrangements following this process.YearNumber of students at primary levelNumber of students at post-primary levelTotal Number of students2009 (DEIS only)102,35761,166163,5232008156,145129,020285,1652007142,157128,056270,213

The scripts of all candidates who appealed their Biology results were already reviewed during the appeal stage to allow for the application of the revised marking scheme, and 56 students received an upgrade as a result at that stage. Once the appeals were finalised, the scripts were reviewed in the case of a further 1,887 students of the total of 20,101 Higher Level Biology candidates whose score was within 3 marks of the next sub-grade, and a further 621 candidates received an upgrade.  The scripts were therefore reviewed in the case of all candidates who had the potential to benefit from the revised marking scheme. All the students involved were contacted by the State Examinations Commission and the CAO was informed of the revised results. This resulted in a change in the offer of a college place for 44 students.No area of human activity can be guaranteed to be error free. What is important is to have systems in place to identify errors when they arise and to rectify them as soon as possible. While it is regrettable that the problem arose in this case it is important to acknowledge that the steps taken demonstrate that the State Examinations Commission has a transparent, fair and robust system of checks and balances in place.Within Higher Level Biology in the Leaving Certificate 2009, 4.5% of the candidate results were upgraded. Overall out of nearly 380,000 Leaving Certificate grades awarded 2,697 have been upgraded. This represents 0.7% of the grades awarded.

I understand that FAS is taking a number of measures to assist apprentices who have been made redundant secure the relevant on-the-job training phases necessary to complete their apprenticeship.The Institutes of Technology have been working closely with FÁS to facilitate apprentices complete their training as quickly as possible and summer blocks in off-the-job training phases were held in a number of the institutes in 2009.In addition, a new education programme has been developed by the Institutes of Technology for redundant apprentices, who cannot otherwise secure the job placements required in order to complete their normal apprenticeship programme. The programme focuses on developing core skills in maths, ICT and business in order to facilitate students progressing to other higher education programmes or to completing their apprenticeship at a later stage. Programmes commenced in September 2009. Participants will receive a FETAC Level 5 Certificate in Construction Technology or Certificate in Engineering Technology for this programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1026	Following a review by the Institutes of Technology of the scope to utilise vacant capacity, it was decided that placing people on programmes which had already started could disadvantage both existing students and the new students, some of whom may have been some time out of the formal education system. As an alternative 280 places were made available on a direct entry basis to a range of newly developed accelerated Level 6 Certificate programmes, which commenced between February and April 2009. Under this initiative unemployed persons were offered the opportunity to complete the first year of a standard two year programme in an accelerated manner so that they could move to the second year of the programme in September 2009.Institutes of Technology also used spare capacity to provide over 900 places on a range of newly developed part-time transition programmes. These programmes were developed to assist unemployed people who may be some time out of the formal education system to find out more about the type of third level courses that may be suited to them and to build their confidence to return to education by developing some of the necessary skills for studying at third level.2,500 new places have been made available for unemployed people on part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses from September 2009. All 2,500 places are on courses that support the goals of the "Smart Economy" and particularly those relating to specific skills needs of exporting sectors identified by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. The scheme is open to people who have been on the Live Register for at least six months or who have been awarded statutory redundancy.In addition, an additional 1,500 PLC places were allocated to VECs nationwide, bringing the total number of approved PLC places to 31,688 for the 2009/2010 academic year.The scope to develop further responses is under consideration in the context of ongoing discussions with other Government Departments on developing appropriate upskilling training and education responses for unemployed people.

The key arrangements are as follows. First, Enterprise Ireland will have responsibility for marketing and promotion of the "Education Ireland" brand overseas and will lead the development, promotion and marketing of international higher education.  Second, Fáilte Ireland will continue to have responsibility for development and promotion of the English language sector; Third, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, and subsequently the amalgamated qualifications body announced under the 2009 Budget, will have responsibility for the regulation of international education programmes, including the introduction of a quality mark and code of practice for Irish providers of education to international students. Fourth, a new High Level Group on International Education will be established under the chairmanship of the Department of Education and Science and will bring together the key Government departments and agencies involved with the education providers themselves.  The first phase of the Group's work will be the preparation of an action plan for enhanced performance.  There has been considerable progress made to date in implementing the new arrangements.My Department is currently working with the various stakeholders to re-allocate existing resources to support the new organisational arrangements.  The International Education Board Ireland, a body under my Department's aegis, is being wound up and the staff and financial resources transferred to Enterprise Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.  The Advisory Council for English Language Schools will be wound-up and the responsibilities and staff will be transferred to the National Qualifications Authority.  I expect that the new arrangements will be in place by the beginning of 2010.My Department is currently finalising arrangements for the High Level Group. In advance of this, it has been convening an inter-agency committee to facilitate greater collaboration and co-ordination among the State bodies involved in promoting international education.  My Department is also represented on the Inter-Departmental Committee on Student Immigration and has been working closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Government Departments to facilitate a co-ordinated approach on this issue.The forthcoming Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill will provide a statutory underpinning to the Quality Mark and code of practice.  In advance of this, responsibility for the internationalisation register, currently maintained by my Department as a list of approved programmes which non-EEA students can attend if they wish to avail of access to the labour market during their studies here, will be transferred to the NQAI early in the new year, facilitating a more joined-up regulatory approach.

The group has met on eight occasions since its establishment in February 2009.A vibrant responsive higher education system will be crucially important in terms of Ireland's future development and the Strategy Group are cognisant of the need to fully engage with all stakeholders in the sector and wider society. A first round of consultation was completed in the summer under which an open call for written submissions elicited a significant and valuable response. More than 100 submissions were received and are available on the Higher Education Authority website: www.hea.ie. I understand that the Strategy Group are undertaking additional detailed consultations to fully inform the development of the new strategy. I expect that the overall process of finalising the strategy report will be completed early in the New Year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1029	The rationale for the introduction of bursaries or other measures to encourage high quality students to undertake priority areas of study would be to address a perceived lack of interest on the part of students in undertaking programmes in particular disciplines. Some €2.5 million per annum is allocated to the Discover Science and Engineering programme, funded by Forfás, to promote the take up of science, engineering and technology in schools and colleges, as well as an awareness of the importance of these disciplines in wider society. The latest figures from the CAO show that the number of people accepting third level places on engineering courses this year increased by almost 21% on 2008/09. In  addition, the number of computing and science place acceptances is up more than 25%. This suggests that students are recognising the value of pursuing such disciplines. The introduction of targeted bursaries or other measures will be considered further in the light of industry views and the significant increases in enrolments that have taken place this year.An Inter-Departmental Committee was established in February 2008 with a view to drawing up an Implementation Plan for the National Skills Strategy. The drafting of the Implementation Plan which is being co-ordinated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is at an advanced stage. However, the changed economic circumstances will certainly have an impact on  the extent to which the targets contained in the National Skills Strategy can be addressed in the short term. The Implementation Plan is being updated to reflect these changing circumstances.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1030	The Government's Framework for Building Ireland's Smart Economy committed to the expansion of summer schools in science and engineering with an emphasis on innovation and commercialisation. As the Deputy may be aware, there is currently a substantial calendar of summer schools in place across higher  education institutions, targeted at both second-level and primary level pupils. Summer schools in the area of science and engineering cover a wide variety of activities, ranging from hands-on experimental work, science theory and career advice. These are designed to stimulate interest in science and engineering courses generally. The scope, including funding implications, for incorporating or expanding innovation and commercialisation activities within summer school programmes is being explored by my Department with the Higher Education Authority.In relation to the young scientist competition, the event has been expanded this year to include a new business programme that will provide selected students with the opportunity to develop the business knowledge they need to turn their innovative ideas into commercial opportunities. The new programme creates a forum for 40 students to be mentored by leading executives and professionals from BT, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Bombardier, Bord Gáis Éireann, IP Innovations, UCD, TCD, Engineers Ireland and Bank of Ireland. The students will gain practical business knowledge from the mentors through a series of workshops and master-classes on subjects such as: protecting intellectual capital, global marketing, international business, stakeholder communications, innovation principles, and business strategy. In addition, appropriate arrangements are being made so that summer placements in higher education institutions will be available for the top performing students in the competition next year.The Smart Economy Framework also makes reference to raising the profile of the National Student Enterprise Awards run by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and encouraging greater participation in enterprise related programmes.Responsibility for the CEBs rests with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand that arrangements for the National Student Enterprise Awards 2009/10, including their timing and their location to a central Dublin venue, should ensure a higher profile for the programme. Furthermore, the Taoiseach announced the establishment of the Sean Lemass Award in June 2009, which will be presented to the overall winner of the Student Enterprise Awards. A fundamental aim of the award will be to encourage greater participation by students at second level in entrepreneurial activities, to encourage more schools to take part in enterprise award schemes, and to raise the profile of the schemes. The initiative will now be taken forward by an inter-agency group which will include officials from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, along with representatives of the Transition Year Support Service, the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1031	I wish to inform the Deputy that significant progress has been made since December 2008 to enhance the role of ICT in education. The Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, published in 2008 re-iterates Government policy to pursue the investment in school infrastructure, within available resources. The Framework commits to working to enhance the role of ICT in the education system, working in partnership with industry to invest further in the provision of equipment and connectivity.My Department has recently participated in an industry advisory group to explore possible approaches to implementing the recommendations set out in the Strategy Group's Report, Investing Effectively in Information and Communications Technology in Schools 2008 — 2013.  This industry advisory group which was chaired by Paul Rellis, Managing Director of Microsoft Ireland, and comprised members of ICT Ireland, the Telecommunications and Internet Federation, the Irish Software Association, officials from my Department, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the National Centre for Technology in Education, published its report on the 16th of November. The report, which is entitled Smart Schools = Smart Economy, makes a number of recommendations including the establishment of an ICT in Schools Steering Group, with key stakeholders participating in the group i.e. teachers, parents, Government, industry and students.   The Report also identified the need for significant investment in ICT for schools over the next three years.  In this regard as a first step, €22 million in grants will issue to primary schools this month.  In line with the Strategy Group and Industry Group Reports I have requested that schools give priority to ensuring there is a teaching laptop and digital projector in every classroom.  It is intended that funding for post primary schools will be made available early in the new year.Progress in other areas includes the prioritisation of the role of the school's ICT coordinating teacher, with the support of the school principal, as central in the provision of ongoing ICT support and advice to schools. A handbook, Planning and Implementing e-Learning in your School, has been provided for principals and ICT co-ordinating teachers, and nationwide seminars for Primary level on e-Learning are due to be rolled out over the coming weeks. The range of digital content, available on the web portal Scoilnet, is being extended.In the area of broadband, my Department is currently awarding contracts under the second phase of the Programme and the indications from the recently completed evaluation of tenders are that this will mean enhanced bandwidth for schools.  The indications also are that there will be significantly less schools dependent on satellite technology for their broadband connectivity.I am also working with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy & Natural Resources, to pursue the Government objective of equipping second-level schools with 100Mb per second of broadband connectivity and installing wireless local area networks.  In this regard, 78 post primary schools have been selected to participate in a pilot project.  I have been informed that the evaluation process has been completed, the preferred bidders selected and contract negotiations are expected to be completed shortly for the connectivity phase of the project.

Donegal projects referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.A list of 61 applications from Co. Donegal schools currently seeking major capital works building projects is attached for ease of reference.In the context of addressing accommodation needs in the short term, the Department grant-aids the provision of temporary accommodation in respect of schools requiring accommodation to cater for additional staffing allocations while awaiting the provision of permanent accommodation.A table compiled from information sent to my Department by schools in Co. Donegal is as follows, which shows a list of schools in the county using rented prefabs as temporary classroom facilities.

The allocation for 2009 is €192 million. In order to minimise the impact of the new annual charge of €300A maximum family rate of €650 appliesCharges have been confined to eligible post-primary children and children availing of concessionary transportWaivers continue to apply in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical cardEligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs still travel free.Parents were facilitated to pay the annual amount in two instalments — in July and December.While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, it is not envisaged that there will be a change in the payment arrangements or a reduction in the amount charged.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1040	The Deputy will be aware that teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of special classes for pupils with a Mild General Learning Disability (MGLD) the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was not fulfilled in two classes in the school referred to by the Deputy and therefore the school no longer qualifies to retain the classes. The school has retained one MGLD class however.  The special classes which have closed pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.All children with MGLD who were in the classes that have been suppressed will be able to receive teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model. Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature. My Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.The Deputy will be aware that my Department's policy is to support the inclusive education of students with special educational needs across the schools system. In this context, a range of supports are provided to schools to enable them cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports available include additional teaching support, special needs assistant support, school transport and grants for the purchase of teaching materials and specialised equipment.The purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer. When the Government was introducing the moratorium in the public sector earlier this year I secured a special arrangement for education which ensured we could fill teacher and SNA posts. The concession also provides for the filling of Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all schools and the first allocation of posts of responsibility in new schools.Under the Dormant Account Scheme 100 DEIS schools serving the most disadvantaged communities were invited to apply for grant assistance to progress towards achievement of digital school status. This school had already been awarded Digital School Status and was excluded from the scope of the scheme since the rationale of the scheme was to assist schools to progress towards achieving digital school status. In view of the limited funds available for the scheme, it was necessary to target eligibility under the scheme.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has approved an emergency works grant to enable the school to address the health and safety issues relating to the playground area. My officials will be in contact with the school in this regard.

The decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.While I will have to await the outcome of these deliberative processes, I can confirm that there are no plans to close small schools at the moment other than those that would arise in the normal course under the current sustainability limits. I fully acknowledge the attachment of local communities to their schools and the association of the school with a sense of place.However, I am of the view that my Department will have to examine the implementation of more strict guidelines in relation to the number of pupils required for the sustainability of schools.The Deputy may be aware that building projects involving amalgamation of schools already attract a high band rating within the Schools Building Programme.

While these figures include the cost of translating documents into languages other than Irish, the cost element in respect of non-Irish translations is not significant.In order to reduce printing and distribution costs my Department adopted a corporate policy during 2008 requiring publications to be web based and documents are printed only in exceptional circumstances. The total cost of printing official documents was €908,346 in 2008 and is €266,386 to date in 2009.My Department does not record the cost of printing documents which have been translated into Irish. Where an official publication is translated into Irish and requires hard copy distribution, it is usually printed as part of a single bilingual document and my Department is not in a position to quantify the element of the overall printing cost which was attributable to the inclusion of the Irish language text. The documents translated into Irish in 2008 and 2009 include a wide range of document types ranging from forms, circulars, questionnaires, and school inspection reports to official publications. Where it is necessary to have hard copies of these documents they are printed within my Department if possible or are forwarded to professional printers. The number of documents which are sent for printing outside my Department has steadily declined since the introduction of my Department's policy of using web based publishing wherever possible.
