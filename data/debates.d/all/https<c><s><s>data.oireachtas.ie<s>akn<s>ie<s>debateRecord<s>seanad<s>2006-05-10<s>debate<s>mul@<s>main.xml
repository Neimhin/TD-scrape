        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_8">It is generally accepted that one of the great successes since the foundation of this State has been the significant contribution made by a civilian unarmed and professional police force, which has remained loyal to the State and whose members have put their lives on the line for this State and have made great sacrifices for peace and order over the past 85 years. It is now a matter of serious public concern that it appears a collision course has been set between the Garda Síochána and the Government on the issue of the reserve force.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I ask at this stage that some common sense be brought to the situation, that people move back from the brink, that space be provided and that conciliation be considered. I call specifically on the GRA to sit down with the Minister now to work out its difficulties on the issue, whether it is an issue of resourcing or operation for the new reserve force. If that happens, the Minister should make an announcement stating that he will postpone by perhaps one or two months the establishment of the reserve force to provide people with that space and the time to sort out the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">It is not in the interest of the country for such a collision to occur. It is certainly not in the interest of the Garda Síochána that it should be advised to take part in politics. Of course, while each individual garda votes in the general election and is entitled to put questions to people on doorsteps, their representative organisation is not entitled to involve itself in a political campaign. It is utterly wrong and is against the spirit of the Garda Síochána and its contribution to the State. It is against the law, which is something it needs to understand, given that all parties in this and in the other House, bar one, the paramilitary party, Sinn Féin, were in favour of the establishment of the reserve force.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I ask the Government, and specifically the Minister, to consider providing space at this time so the matter can be sorted out and the situation can be turned into a win for everyone.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I agree with the points made by Senator Brian Hayes. The matter is heading over the brink at this stage, which is generally recognised by people. Politicians and public representatives have handled themselves very well on the matter to date. They have made clear their concerns. My father was a founder member of the old Garda representative body and, while Senator Hayes will be too young to remember, gardaí did not even have votes at that stage. I recall the first time my father voted, about which he was very excited. The State has a long understanding of the relationship between the Garda force, the Legislature and public representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Both sides must recognise certain realities. The Garda reserve force is a legislative reality. It exists and it will have to remain. On the other hand, the Garda Representative Association's valid concerns about its professionalism and the professionalism of the force are equally valid, which must also be recognised. As I have said previously, I am a consistent admirer of the Commissioner, who is an extraordinarily talented man. He is doing a very good job in extremely difficult circumstances. I know from listening to him on the radio this morning that what he said came from the heart. I also believe that the Minister has shown time and again, even when he has taken a hard public line, that he is prepared to do business if people wish to do business with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I disagree with Senator Brian Hayes that this can be settled by both parties sitting down together. It needs to be resolved through a process of mediation. There are sensible people on all sides of this debate. The Garda Representative Association has valid concerns, the Legislature has made certain decisions, the Commissioner has a high level of responsibility and the Minister has a duty to implement the wishes of Parliament. While there are different points of view on the matter, they are not mutually exclusive. The parties can be brought together through common sense and a process of moving forward. Everybody will have to move slightly from their stated positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I am delighted that Senator Brian Hayes has raised this matter in a way which does not make it a political football. This issue is something about which we are all concerned. It must be dealt with and everybody must take a step back. I propose that the issue is moved into a mediation or arbitration process, with all parties prepared to look positively at the outcome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_16">There are few things more threatening to the perception of a valid democracy than the suggestion that the security forces enter into partisan politics. If, for instance, the armed forces were to take a similar stance, we would be rightly alarmed. However, I do not dispute the right of individual members of such forces to make political representations.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">It appears that the GRA missed this topic when it was proceeding, extremely slowly, through both Houses of the Oireachtas, failed to make representations, let the issue slide and is now in a phase of extraordinary overreaction. It is overreacting to something which the overwhelming majority of the population believes is a good idea. It is not just in confrontation with the Government or even with one party within that Government, but with the Oireachtas and the will of the people. It would be a different matter if a proposal related to the Garda Síochána had been passed by the Oireachtas but was disapproved of by the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The public are bewildered as to why gardaí have such an objection to the reserve force and are coming to very unflattering conclusions about the motives of those gardaí. If the public were to come to similar conclusions about the actions of a teachers' union, that union would have good reason to be concerned about the public perception of its members.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">The GRA should reflect very carefully. If it has legitimate concerns about the safety or vulnerability of its members, they can be addressed. I do not believe any Government wants to put members of the Garda Síochána into a position where they are at risk. However, that is entirely different to saying that the members of the GRA can ignore the wish of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">I ask the Leader for a debate on industrial safety in the near future. There was a 50% increase in the number of fatal industrial accidents last year. A disproportionate number of non-nationals were victims of those fatal accidents, particularly in the building industry. That fact lends support to the assertions of the trade union movement that less than noble practices are prevalent in some sections of the building industry with regard to working conditions. The Health and Safety Authority has said that one of the major pressure areas this year will be the public sector, that is, public administration and the local authorities. The HSA has said that up to one quarter of local authorities are blissfully unaware of their obligations under health and safety legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">A classic element of this country's problems, whether it be in work, road safety or planning, is that we do not enforce the laws we pass. In the area of safety, we must ensure the public sector is a model of best practice, rather than lagging behind other sectors and that those involved in the building industry are particularly careful. I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the report of the Health and Safety Authority because it is an important topic.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_22">Sometimes I wonder how much we appreciate the fact that we live in an open, free and democratic State. We often take it for granted. At the basis of such a State is a reliance upon the security forces, both the Garda Síochána and the armed forces, to uphold the democracy we enjoy. To do that, they must be removed from the political arena. That is not to say they should not have or voice opinions on how the forces are operated but that is very different from them entering the political arena.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">We had one particularly unfortunate situation in the early years of the State, well documented by Senator Maurice Manning and others, when there was a real danger that the police force would be misused for political purposes. Fortunately, we came through that difficulty and now have an excellent and professional service. It is entirely wrong for the armed forces or the Garda Síochána to intervene in politics. Members have their vote and should use it. It is right that they have a vote but to organise political campaigns is not appropriate and must be rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I do not see that there is much room for manoeuvre with regard to the reserve force. The Oireachtas has spoken on the matter and its will is clear. Certainly discussions can take place on the modalities of how the force will be set up, but its actual establishment should and will happen. I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House, as he is always willing to do, to speak to us on the matter. However, on the suggestion that the parties should sit down together, they could do so to discuss how the system will work but not whether the reserve force will be established.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_25">In the 28 years that GRA conferences have taken place, this is the first time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was not invited to address the gathering. In that context, the low morale within the Garda Síochána regarding the reserve force is apparent. When the Garda Síochána Bill was going through this House — and the Minister consistently reminded us that it had the support of all parties in the Oireachtas, except Sinn Féin — why were Members not lobbied by the GRA or the AGSI? All the lobbying took place after the legislation was passed. Why? It is my understanding that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated to the Garda organisations that the reserve force would be included in the legislation but would not be implemented on his watch. That is why the organisations are annoyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I support Senator Dardis's call for the Minister to come to the House. I ask whether the Minister indicated to the Garda organisations that he would not implement the reserve force during his watch. That is my one, straight question and I can understand the frustration and annoyance of the organisations at the sequence of events if that is the case.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_27">We all want to see a resolution of this problem. It is not the Garda Síochána that is in conflict with the Oireachtas but the Garda associations. As far as the principle is concerned, which is accepted and working very well in many other countries, it is our duty to uphold the institutions of the State and not to call that into question. I am rather surprised at Senator Finucane's suggestion that, in some way or another, legislation passed in this House should be deemed to be suspended for a certain period, where ——</p>

          <p eId="para_36">The fairness, impartiality and neutrality of the Garda Síochána is an integral part of the bedrock of our democracy. I strongly support what Senators Brian Hayes, O'Toole, Ryan, Dardis and Finucane stated. For the sake of our democracy, we cannot have the Garda force embroiled in controversy or getting involved in a semblance of politics. That would be wrong. Senator O'Toole touched on the fact that at this stage resolution of this issue will only come about through mediation. Several wise heads are available to the force and the Minister. The parties involved may not be able to meet face to face but the matter must be resolved. Perhaps Senator O'Toole or other members of the House might offer their services.</p>

In my contribution I made the point that I always felt the Government had acted in a positive, courageous and, at times, independent manner to try to find solutions to the ongoing difficulties which exist in the Middle East.

If we do not recognise that and if Palestinian society, which seems to be on the verge of collapse from what I have recently read, does so, who will negotiate and bring about a solution? This problem will continue, not for years but for decades and centuries. I appeal to the Government to continue, even in a more pro-active way, to ensure EU aid is re-instated. Otherwise, in the very near future we will see on our television screens children on the verge of death and absolute, uncontrolled violence. Above all else, we must consider the difficulty and danger that such violence will extend further throughout the world.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_44">For several hours yesterday we debated the crisis in accident and emergency departments. Many Senators outlined the difficulties with and at accident and emergency departments throughout the country. Many of these relate to the abuse and assaults that nursing staff and professional people must endure in such situations. That pales into insignificance when compared with the numbers of assaults against psychiatric nurses. Attacks on psychiatric nurses have increased by an alarming 47% and more than 1,250 were attacked throughout the country last year alone. When we consider this in the context of fewer patients within the psychiatric services, it is an alarming situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The report of the 2003 task force made recommendations, none of which have been implemented by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. I call on the Minister to immediately respond positively to the fears and abuse which psychiatric nurses have had to endure. These assaults have accounted for limb fractures and burns. Assaults of every imaginable kind have occurred, with whatever weapons were available, such as crutches or chairs. It is important that the Minister takes immediate action, before we have another crisis. There is no compensation for the people assaulted in this way by patients. It is not good enough that a professional body, such as the PNA, is allowed to continue in this way.</p>

Regarding Garda resources, questions arise on the use of anti-stab vests and proper radio systems. The Garda Síochána is not properly resourced, despite being told on numerous occasions it is receiving more funding than ever. Those are just three areas in which the force is not properly resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">On the question of the Garda reserve, there is no doubt the Minister informed the associations, the AGSI and the GRA, that the relevant legislation was only enabling legislation and that the reserve would not be introduced on his watch, as stated by Senator Finucane.

The utterances made, which smack of politics, are unfortunate and ill-advised. It behoves all of us in this House and the Dáil that regardless of whether we agree with legislation, it becomes law when on the Statute Book. We are duty bound to support it. Therefore I consider some of the utterances made, whatever the feelings which may have motivated them, to be unfortunate and ill-advised.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Will the Leader indicate when it is proposed to bring the Medical Practitioners Bill before the House? One item exercised the minds of the Members of this House and was raised by all sides, including Senators Finucane and Cummins, along with myself and others. This related to alternative medicine, as opposed to established medicine, as practised in the famous Killaloe clinic. I stated at the time there was a legislative void and the Leader agreed. It is time for the void to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">I have not raised my next issue in the House before because I might be seen to be drawing water to my own well. Senator Ulick Burke is correct. Attacks on psychiatric nurses have been taking place for a number of years. As a practising psychiatric nurse, I have received a number of injuries. It should be remembered that a number of people avail of psychiatric services not because they want psychiatric treatment but because they wish to avoid punishment by the courts. Some of those are people who will attack and injure psychiatric nurses, both male and female. The point was well made by Senator Ulick Burke.</p>

Rural stations are being closed down and the gardaí are still operating with their hands behind their back. There is still no proper PULSE computer system, which they have sought. Gardaí now want their force brought to a level where they could deliver an efficient and effective service. The 2,000 extra gardaí promised have not been delivered.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_72">While I share much of what Senator Ó Murchú and Senator Maurice Hayes has said about the Middle East, I am sure all of us will be encouraged and heartened by the decision of the EU in recent days to not only ensure that humanitarian aid is not suspended, but also to find ways and means to engage in dialogue with the Hamas ministries to ensure that the points the Senators have been making will not happen. We are all encouraged by the swift decision of the Olmert Administration in Israel, following the formation of the Cabinet, when it moved to remove illegal Jewish settlers from Arab homes in the West Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">As someone who is an expert on the peace process in Northern Ireland, Senator Maurice Hayes will agree with me that the building blocks to peace are created by small steps such as these, rather than large leaps. In that respect, it is right and proper that this House continue to monitor what is happening because of Ireland's distinguished role in this conflict and its own courageous disposition, as Senator Ó Murchú has outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">My main reason for speaking are reports over the past few days from America which indicate that Irish people have been involved in illegally trafficking Irish citizens across the Canadian border. Several arrests have been made by ICE, which is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. For those of us involved in the area of immigration reform, this is a bitter blow. It will create a great deal of devastation for the movement towards meaningful immigration reform in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">There are right-wing elements and, sadly, many Irish-Americans involved who are totally hostile to the concept of immigration reform. There are strong racist undertones. I receive e-mails on a regular basis from one individual who is head of a county association in New York and what he conveys, and the racist subtexts in much of what is said, would make one's blood curdle. The Leader may wish to comment on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">I raise the matter in this House as we are on the cusp of summer, when many young Irish contemplate travelling to the United States. If these people are intending to travel and break the waiver programme, I strongly advise they stay within the law. If they do not have a proper visa they should not attempt to enter the United States illegally. This is not only for their own sakes but for the sake of the wider issue of immigration reform, which is close to being resolved.</p>

For any democracy to function effectively the security forces must at all times accept and carry out the will of the democratically elected Government and the Parliament. I ask the Leader to bring a composite motion before the House, incorporating the comments of Senator Brian Hayes, Senator O'Toole and Senator Ryan, to reflect that principle, because it is one on which there can be no compromise. Otherwise we in these Houses serve ourselves rather than the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I support Senator Bannon's call for a debate on volunteerism. It is essential that volunteerism, of which there is a good tradition in this country, is not neglected with the development of a more affluent society and the concomitant demands on people's time. I disagree totally with Senator Bannon that State money is the answer. Volunteerism involves people in the community freely giving of their time in many areas of social activity to enhance the quality of life of others not as well off as they.</p>

The NRA now has a policy of devoting 95% of its budget to national primary routes. National secondary routes and regional roads are also important and we need to review how that money is spent. It is not always difficult to link one national primary road with another — it often only involves ten or 12 miles. Many roads around the country are very dangerous and we must get better value for money for the sums of €500,000 or €1 million that are being spent on two or three miles of overlay. I ask the Leader for a debate on how best to approach the issues of national secondary and county roads because some are in a very dangerous state and people will die.</p>

In fact, the arrangement was made with the Tánaiste's office three or four weeks ago and then her office changed it. We did not know whether she was coming here but obviously she could not as she is in the United States. However, there was no conflict between my office and hers about scheduling. Sometimes a Minister's office will inform us that the Minister will come to the House to make an opening statement while another Minister will attend the full debate but in this case we were not told who would attend the debate. Given that she was in Pennsylvania, she could not be in the Seanad. There was no Seanad scheduling conflict. My office does not engage in conflicts, except political ones, of course.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">Senator Brian Hayes made the point that our police force is unarmed. He spoke about democracy and the representative organisations and expressed his dismay at the tone and content of what was said by the GRA. The gardaí can vote and when politicians call to their front doors, they are entitled to raise points with them. Politicians are looking for their vote and gardaí are seeking to express their opinions. I have often had exchanges at the front doors of houses of both Army and Garda personnel. That is wholesome and proper. We should not get too puffed up about ourselves. We are in favour of the legislation that we have passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">There has been much controversy about what the Minister said or did not say about "his watch". It is easy to get copies of the Official Report and see exactly what Members have said. Senator O'Toole spoke about the GRA and its valid concerns. He suggested mediation.

I was nonplussed to discover from the HSA that the number of deaths that occurred shows an increase of 50%, which is huge.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_181">On Committee Stage, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that some aspects of the amendment merited inclusion. He asked Senators for time to consider the wording in conjunction with the Parliamentary Counsel and to consult the Garda authorities and the banks on the proposal's operational and practical implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The amendment would have the effect of broadening the definition of "account". Having consulted with the relevant parties, the Minister is of the view that inclusion of the proposed amendment would place too heavy a burden on the banks and render the provision inoperable. The Irish Bankers Federation indicated that the effect of the proposed amendment would be that all trust accounts, nominee company and trust company accounts would be unencompassed by the proposed addition to the definition of "account".</p>
          <p eId="para_183">While the names of all beneficiaries of trust accounts are retained by the banks in files, names of beneficiaries would not normally be on the account. As a result, in order to operate this provision, the banks would have to undertake a manual search which would be an unwieldy and virtually impossible task. It may also be difficult, and even impossible, in some circumstances for a bank to ascertain whether an account is held in whole or part by a person for someone else. It would be an unfair burden to put on the banks to uncover detail regarding, for example, an account beneficiary in a large trawling exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The amendment goes beyond what is covered in the terms of the protocol of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the EU 2000. For these reasons, Senator Tuffy will appreciate it is impossible to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that he would revert to the Parliamentary Counsel on these amendments. Their purpose is to permit applications for account information and account monitoring orders for criminal investigations in the State or an EU member state, together with applications from EU member states for orders for freezing property or evidence to be made in private. A precedent exists for such provision with regard to restraint orders in the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Since then, however, the Attorney General has advised against including such provision for such warrants in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The Attorney General was specifically anxious that careful consideration be given to the circumstances in which limits would be put on the issue of search warrants. Without specific provision to the contrary, the issue is left open under current wording. The application could be made in public or in private. By including specific provisions, it would cast doubt on the ability to hear applications in private in other circumstances where no such provision was included. The wording as it stands allows for applications to be made in either private or public.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">In light of the views of the Attorney General on this issue, in the context of such search warrants where the same principle applies, it is, therefore, not intended in the interests of legal certainty and consistency to accept the proposed amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated it was unlikely he would be in a position to accept these amendments. He consulted the Attorney General on them. The effect of amendments Nos. 3 and 5 would be to delete the provision that an account information or account monitoring order made for criminal investigations in the State or an EU member state would be effective as if it were an order of the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">The effect of the declaration of amendment No. 15 would be to delete the reference to an order made for the freezing of evidence to have effect if it were an order of the High Court. The legal advice received on the matter is that it is an important provision for any of these orders to have effect as if it were an order of the District Court or the High Court. This means that it would be an offence, for which a sanction would apply, not to comply with the order.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The orders concerned could be considered to impinge on people's rights and it is not appropriate that such powers should be granted to an individual judge operating without the backing of the court. The order must be made by the court and not by an individual. The provision, as it stands in the Bill, emphasises the judicial nature of this function and ensures that the judge concerned has no doubt that he or she is acting judicially when such an order is made. The reference to the District Court and the High Court in these provisions is important and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">I second the amendment. Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 11 relate to section 8 of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993. There is an important safeguard in that Act that allows a designated judge of the High Court to investigate authorisations and inspect any official documents relating to an authorisation or its application. The Minister said that he would consider this. It is a safeguard that should be applied to this Bill as it was in the 1993 Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I did not mention the other Labour Party amendments. Amendment No. 9 was to be examined by the Minister following Committee Stage. At the very least, legislation should limit the ability of another state to use the information it collects. Under the provisions, it should have to adhere to the wording of the convention. At present, the Bill allows for more than the convention it is supposed to implement. We are trying to be specific in amendment No. 9. The Minister of State might explain how the Government amendments deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Amendment No. 13 covers an area that the Minister said he would consider. We are trying to provide a defence for communications companies which might not be able to access the equipment in another country but which can use their best endeavours to do so.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFahey" eId="spk_144" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_209">Amendments Nos. 6 to 14, inclusive, relate to interception provisions. Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 11 were raised by Senator Cummins and Senator Brian Hayes on Committee Stage. Amendments Nos. 7 and 11 would bring all documentation on notification of member states of interceptions or applications to member states for interceptions within the terms of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993. The amendments sought to allow a review of the interception provisions of this Bill by a judge of the High Court, as is provided for in section 8 of the 1993 Act. At the time the Minister said he would review if it was possible to agree with what was being sought having regard to the provisions of the EU convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Having considered the matter further, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, the Minister is of the view that bringing authorisations under such provisions within the scope of review by a judge of the High Court, as provided for in section 8 of the 1993 Act, would be not just a useful but also a desirable addition for the purpose of independent oversight of all interception. Towards that end the official amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 14 have been brought forward to meet the concerns expressed by the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Amendment No. 14 also extends the provision in section 9 of the 1993 Act to the regime encompassed by this Bill. Under section 9 of the 1993 Act there is a provision for a companies complaints referee, who will be a Circuit Court or District Court judge or a barrister or solicitor of ten years' standing appointed by the Taoiseach. He or she may review complaints from individuals about certain aspects of the Act. The oversights envisaged, however, will not obviously, implicitly or explicitly, allow the designated judge to enjoy any degree of extra-territoriality. The oversight rule would be confined solely to decisions and actions taken domestically by the Minister or the Garda. It would not, for example, extend to non-national decision making. Including this provision would not conflict with the interception provisions of the EU convention. I am grateful to Senators Brian Hayes and Cummins for making these proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Amendment No. 8 was also proposed on Committee Stage by Senator Cummins. The amendment seeks to provide that the interception being carried out here by another member state where technical assistance from Ireland is not required will be deemed to be an authorisation within the terms of the Interception of Postal Packages and Telecommunications Messages (Regulations) Act 1993 and the directions which issued to a telecommunications provider should also apply to these interceptions. Section 26(3) provides that if an authorisation is given under section 2 of the 1993 Act, the Minister will agree to allow an interception not requiring technical assistance to be carried out or continued. As technical assistance from the State is not required in this instance, the effect of an interception under section 26(1)(<i>c</i>), the question of the issue of instructions to authorised undertakings under section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1993 does not arise. The amendment sought, therefore, is unnecessary as the point being made is already catered for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Amendments Nos. 6, 9 and 13 on the part of the Labour Party were previously tabled on Committee Stage. On amendment No. 6 the purpose of this provision is to give effect to Articles 18.6 and 18.7 of the 2000 convention. The provisions included the option of Ireland making a declaration to the EU at the time of ratification of the EU mutual assistance convention that we are unable to provide for immediate interception and transmission of telecommunications to EU member states. In that event, Ireland would be obliged to intercept, record and subsequently transmit telecommunications recordings to the requesting member state if we would make an interception in a similar domestic context. This will be done when the information provided in Articles 18(3) and 18(4) of the 2000 convention is presented by the requesting state. This information relates to issues such as from whom the request is received, the conduct being investigated and the desired duration of the interception etc. The possibility of making the declaration provided for in Article 18(17) is a safeguard and enables us to review the capacity of the telecommunications system we have in operation, prior to ratification.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">On Committee Stage, Senator Tuffy was concerned the provision would allow the Minister to change the law by an executive act. This is not the case. Ireland would be obliged to advise the Oireachtas at the time of ratification of any proposed declaration and in the event of any subsequent amendment to that declaration. The Attorney General's office supports this view and for these reasons I cannot support the proposed deletion.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Amendment No. 9, if accepted, would have the effect of Ireland legislating to provide that information obtained prior to the Minister agreeing to an interception where technical assistance from Ireland is not required would not be used except in the specific conditions provided for in Articles 2(4)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the convention. Ireland cannot legislate to tell other countries what they can or cannot do. We have covered this issue in subsection (5), which provides that the material already intercepted in a number of circumstances, including where an authorisation is not subsequently given, may not be used or may be used under specified conditions which will be outlined by the Minister in writing. These conditions will obviously include, but need not be limited to, those in Article 2(4)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the convention. The point raised is thus already covered in the Bill and, therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Amendment No. 13 requires authorised undertakings in the State to use their best endeavours to access interception equipment in a member state to intercept messages which cannot be directly intercepted in the State. Section 27(2)(<i>d</i>) provides that where the authorised undertaking has received directions to facilitate, and it can facilitate interception by accessing interception equipment in a member state, it will do so by accessing the equipment. To accede to the proposed amendment would run contrary to the provisions in section 27(2)(<i>d</i>) and for that reason I cannot accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Amendments Nos. 10 and 12, which relate to section 26 are merely technical. The first, to section 26(3), replaces the word "allow" with "authorise". This is for the sake of clarity and consistency as "authorise" and "authorisation" are used throughout the provisions. Likewise, the second minor amendment to section 26(4) does not change the meaning but is a clarification and tidying up of the language used.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">In summary, amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 14 cover the issues raised in amendments Nos. 7 and 11. I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 6, 8, 9 and 13.</p>

As the Minister indicated on Committee Stage, subsection (10) of this section provides for a court to have discretion to decide if such evidence is admissible and allows the court, when making such a decision, to consider whether the law of the state concerned allowed for legal representation and cross-examination of the person, and also to consider any other aspect in which the taking of evidence may differ from the procedures used in Ireland. The proposed amendment is therefore superfluous and repetitive. As the Bill stands, the court already has discretion to exclude evidence under section 10 and as the Minister indicated on Committee Stage, it is not proposed to accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">With regard to amendments Nos. 18 and 19, I agreed it is correct that a judge should be satisfied that the section applies to a request from another state for evidence rather than that it should appear to the judge that the request relates to this section. The judge cannot, however, be satisfied before issuing a warrant for evidence that a warrant is necessary for entry or that the occupier has not consented or is unlikely to consent to entry. It is in the order that the judge be reasonably satisfied with regard to these issues. For that reason, I cannot accept these amendments. I thank the Senators for bringing them forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">An amendment similar to this one was tabled on Committee Stage. It requires other member states to serve documents in this country requiring persons to attend hearings in another state within a reasonable time prior to the hearing. As the Minister indicated on Committee Stage, it would not be prudent or correct of us to impose such a provision on other states. The onus is on other states to serve documents in good time if they require a person to attend there. It is in a state's interest to ensure that documents are served within a reasonable time period prior to the hearing. That goes without saying. I consider the amendment to be superfluous in this regard as it would entail placing an onus in Irish law on other states. That is not appropriate and for that reason the proposed amendment cannot be accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">Senators raised this issue on Committee Stage and the Minister indicated then that the subsection Senators wish to delete is an important provision permitting the courts to refuse to grant measures where they do not have jurisdiction. It is a provision that has featured previously in legislation dealing with orders. As has been previously indicated, the same wording may be found in a civil proceedings context at section 13(2) of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act of 1998. I do not propose to accept this amendment as this provision is not only a useful but an essential one. It directs the court to have regard as to whether the order being sought by virtue of the jurisdiction it has is a reasonable order to make. It is important that the court has that ability as orders can be sought by the Minister or the Garda and it is not sufficient to presume that the making of the application in itself constitutes an adequate examination of the powers of the court in this regard. The presiding judge is the only person capable of making a decision as to the extent of the legal powers he or she has with regard to any application.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I appreciate that the wording of this particular provision is a little unwieldy and the possibility of rewording it was examined. However, the wording as it currently stands in section 83 follows on from the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act of 1998. The advice from the Attorney General's office is that it would be inadvisable to break from precedent in this instance and a redrafting could have the effect of omissions by means of inadvertence. For the reasons outlined, therefore, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">This amendment was proposed on Committee Stage. The Minister indicated then that he did not consider that it served any purpose and that he did not propose to accept it, subject to further consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel. The proposed amendment appears to attempt to ensure that any order made under the 1994 Act prior to the commencement of the section is not nullified in any way by amendments made under this section. Such provision is not necessary as legislation is not retrospective and any order made lawfully under the Act prior to the commencement of this section cannot be altered by this section. As has been previously indicated, the provisions of this section amending the 1994 Act do not on the whole refer to orders. Most of the proposed amendments deal with terminology and the clarification of terms. Subsection (<i>h</i>), which clarifies the empowerment under the section of a member of the gardaí to have access or take away a document, is to be construed as authorisation to do so. Subsection (<i>e</i>) clarifies that orders under the section may relate to property in an EU member state. The changing of the name “restraint order” to “freezing order” will not affect the validity of any restraint order made lawfully under the 1994 Act. The change in terminology is simply to bring our terms into line with those in the relevant international instruments. I can now confirm, following further consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel, that the proposed amendment does not serve any purpose and for this reason I do not propose to accept it.</p>

This is important legislation which will strengthen our hand in the fight against terrorism and transnational crime. Effective co-operation among the member states of the European Union and among states worldwide is of increased importance in recent times. We must ensure that our international boundaries cannot be used by criminals to their advantage and that international co-operation among states, both in terms of detection and prosecution of criminals, is maximised.

          <p eId="para_256">I thank the Minister and Minister of State and their staff for the debate on this Bill. Certain issues still require further debate and can be debated when the Bill goes through the Dáil. I support the legislation in principle but have concerns about its provisions. Other legislation relating to the keeping of telephone records by companies, which could be asked to provide this information to the Garda Síochána, was dealt with by the House last year. Many of these provisions are being included in different pieces of legislation and are coming into force by stealth. As Senator Cummins noted, this Bill is very technical. I am not criticising the Government because I realise these provisions relate to Ireland's obligations as an EU member.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">In respect of the intercepting of data, legislation should possibly be consolidated and safeguards introduced to protect people's rights. We should examine the legislation in its entirety and then ensure that our citizens are protected. I withdrew an amendment of mine when the Minister of State explained that it was not possible to place this kind of requirement on another member state. However, this legislation, in conjunction with the legislation in other countries, gives other states powers in respect of our citizens which are quite over-reaching. We need certain powers to deal with crime but we also need to protect our citizens' rights with regard to data protection and other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The Minister should examine the issue in its entirety, consult with the public and interested parties, such as communications companies, and produce legislation that consolidates existing legislation into a single Bill, although I concede that this might not be possible. The issue should be addressed in a comprehensive way and protections with which our society agrees should be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I understand that people in the US are more sensitive about these issues than people in this country. We must be wary because changes brought about by legislation are being introduced by stealth and we may lose sight of the fact that some of our rights are gradually being eroded.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">I join with others in complimenting the Minister and his officials on introducing the Bill and guiding it through this House. The Bill's purpose is to ensure compliance with many obligations and decisions made at EU level. This reflects the growing influence of the EU on domestic legislation, a scenario with which I have no difficulty because it is a positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The issues raised by Senator Tuffy are interesting. Obviously, we must be conscious of people's rights and be particularly vigilant to avoid miscarriages of justice. However, all too often, serious criminals use general rights to avoid detection and prosecution. We should be conscious that this impinges to a large extent on other people's rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Many well-known criminals are at large. In the fight against crime, which, as the Minister of State rightly noted, does not recognise national boundaries, it behoves all states to co-operate with each other to put systems in place that can adequately ensure that the rule of law is applied across the board. It is important to balance the rights of culprits with the rights of victims. I do not see evidence of this in much of the operation of the criminal justice system, a state of affairs of which both Houses should be conscious. My comments are perhaps a counterpoint to Senator Tuffy's comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I am aware that our system is predicated on ensuring that serious miscarriages of justice, like those which pertained to crimes of a political nature witnessed in the neighbouring jurisdiction, do not take place and that innocent people are not incarcerated. However, well-known criminals who are amassing fortunes are at large and it is often the less important criminals who end up in prison. This illustrates the flaws in our system. This Bill is a component of an overall framework which is needed to redress this balance.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">The Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 was introduced in this House over 12 months ago and a number of amendments were made during its passage through the House. I am glad to have the opportunity to return to the Seanad to report on further amendments made to the Bill in Dáil Éireann. One Government amendment and two Opposition amendments were accepted on Committee Stage, while two further Opposition amendments were accepted on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Amendment No. 1 allows for the transfer of parental leave between parents in situations where both parents are employed by the same employer. Such amendments were rejected during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad. However, on further reflection, I was able to accept them on Report Stage in the Dáil. The amendments offer parents some flexibility in how they care for their children by allowing couples employed by the same employer to share their parental leave entitlements in whatever manner they wish subject to the agreement of the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Any provisions that allow for the transfer of parental leave between parents must take cognisance of the burden on the employer from an operational and administrative perspective. The amendment addresses this issue by confining the sharing of the leave entitlement to one employment and offering the option of working out an arrangement that will meet the needs of employers and employees. In situations where both parents work for the same company or employer, it might be suitable that one parent should be allowed to use the other's parental leave. I was happy to accept these amendments on the basis that they provide a balanced solution by offering enhanced flexibility to parents employed by the same company or employer while also recognising the operational requirements of the employer.</p>

Recently, I noticed that Germany is extending its leave for parents to 18 months. It is becoming the norm in EU countries to have longer parental leave than we do. We still have a long way to go in the area of flexibility. The amendment is a good one but more needs to be done. People have a right to flexibility, a matter the Labour Party raised during debates on this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">Amendment No. 2 extends the existing <i>force majeure</i> leave entitlement in section 13 of the Parental Leave Act 1998 to employees in respect of persons with whom they have relationships of domestic dependency, including same sex partners. Many Senators will recall that the absence of a provision extending <i>force majeure</i> to same sex partners was criticised during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad. The Bill as initiated did not make provision for the extension of the <i>force majeure</i> provisions of the principal Act to same sex partners because when the Bill was being considered by the Government, the Law Reform Commission was conducting a consultation process and review of the rights and duties of co-habitees.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">In light of this process, it was decided to await the completion of the Commission's review so that the Government would have an opportunity to consider the issue in a wider sense. Following robust debate in the House on this issue, I undertook to put the matter to Government again. Due to this commitment, the matter was reviewed and I am pleased to say the Government has agreed to the extension of <i>force majeure</i> leave provisions to employees in respect of persons with whom they have relationships of domestic dependency, including same sex couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The amendment reflects the reality of many domestic relationships not covered by the existing provisions where, in an emergency situation arising from an illness or injury of a person residing with the employee, one reasonably relies on the other to make arrangements for the provision of care. To avoid doubt in the interpretation of this new provision, the text expressly states that the sexual orientation of the person is immaterial.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">I acknowledge that the Government has recognised the difficulties of many same sex couples in their daily lives. I welcome the amendment and hope it is a signal from the Government that it will take on board the fuller aspects of Fine Gael's civil partnership proposals, which are widely accepted by the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and other organisations. I also hope that the Government will continue to table proposals to extend equal rights to all citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">This provision would make life easier and give people comfort by letting them know that if an employee were to get sick or be injured, his or her partner would be able to avail of <i>force majeure</i> leave arrangements. I welcome that full equality for all citizens is being introduced to our legislation and I look forward to more of the same. I thank the Minister of State.</p>

Many people do not realise their entitlements and, when something happens, they take holiday leave instead.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_281">My views differ significantly to those expressed. When we discuss civil partnerships, it is important that there is no dilution of the status of heterosexual marriages. Unfortunately, there are many pressures in that area, which have consequently given rise to many marital breakdowns. This is not in the interests of society or the State. Any movement in the civil partnership direction will take full cognisance of that issue. My views are reflected in a strong body of opinion. We do not want negative discrimination against anyone, but the literal interpretation of equality often does not reflect the reality. I would like to think that the status of marriage in particular rather than other forms of relationships will always be the subject of positive discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The Dáil amendment states: "a person who resides with an employee is taken to be in a relationship of domestic dependency with the employee if, in the event of injury or illness, one reasonably relies on the other to make arrangements for the provision of care". I assume that this does not just relate to sexual orientation but also refers to a daughter or son living with parents who may find herself or himself in need of care. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Equally, I wish to echo the point that social and family-centred legislation, which assists people with difficulties in society to strengthen their relationship with those who are near and dear to them, is important. However, as Senator Terry has also recognised, this must always be balanced with the difficulties faced by employers. Recently, I have noted that some employers, particularly small employers, have great difficulty when people take maternity or paternity leave or whatever, and find that the absence of key staff from the organisation has a major impact. This affects both the organisation and everyone working within it. Hence, as the Minister of State has correctly pointed out, much of this legislation is subject to the agreement of the employer. This is essential because it must be recognised that at times, not every organisation is sufficiently large or strong to withstand the absence of key people.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_287">The establishment of the road safety authority is an important element in the Government's strategy to improve road safety and I am pleased to be in a position to bring the Bill to the Seanad today. The purpose of the Bill is to establish the road safety authority and to make an amendment to the Road Traffic Act 2002 to facilitate the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications on a bilateral basis between the UK, Northern Ireland and ourselves. In regard to the code of road traffic legislation in general, I intend to introduce in the near future a Bill to amend the Road Traffic Acts. This Bill will include provisions in regard to drink driving, use of mobile phones, speed cameras and enabling provisions to facilitate future reforms of the driver licensing system.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The decision to establish the road safety authority was taken after detailed analysis and full consideration of the issues involved. I am confident that the establishment of the authority will lead to a more focused development of initiatives to promote road safety, result in improvements in driver formation in general and lead to improved service delivery for the driving test, which will facilitate future reform of the driver licensing system. The authority will play a major role in the development of future road safety strategies by developing programmes that will form the basis of the Government's future road safety strategies. The headquarters of the road safety authority will have an office in Loughrea, together with driving test centres throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The establishment of the authority is a crucial step in promoting the road safety agenda. I anticipate that the authority will be in a position to deliver a more flexible driver testing service and be able to respond more readily to customer needs and future demand. Dealing effectively with a continuing backlog in applications for the service is a prerequisite to bringing forward reforms in the licensing system to reduce long-term reliance on provisional licences. In this context, we are committed to eliminating the current backlog by the middle of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">In light of the authority's duty to raise driving standards, I envisage such a body having the necessary flexibility to take an innovative approach to the whole area of driving standards that will have long-term benefits for road safety. Such benefits will not be as immediate as those resulting from the targeting of the offences of speeding, seat belt wearing and drink driving. However, it is important to foster the development of driving standards in order to underpin the overall strategy for road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">When the legislation was introduced, the primary objective was to establish a separate public sector body to deliver the driver testing service and assume responsibility for related functions. However, it was decided to assign additional functions to the authority and change its name from the Driver Testing and Standards Authority to road safety authority to reflect the wider role being assigned to it. The additional functions assigned to the authority are intended to bring within one single authority activities, currently under the auspices of the Department or its agencies, which are focused on improving driver and vehicle standards and the promotion of road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The functions are provided for in section 4 of the Bill. The authority will have functions in regard to driving tests, vehicle testing and registration of instructors, which will be designated in regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts. The authority will be the issuing authority for certificates of competency following successful completion of a driving test, and test certificates certifying that vehicles meet test standards on successful completion of a vehicle test. In this context, the authority will take over responsibility for the commercial vehicle testing scheme operated by local authorities and the car testing scheme operated by the NCT.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The authority will be charged with the registration of driving instructors. It will be the approved body which will issue instruction certificates for the purpose of regulating driving instructors. It is envisaged that the authority will also carry out functions related to driving, provisional licences and vehicle standards which are currently carried out by the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">In the case of licensing, blank licences are issued to licensing authorities and the operation of the licensing system, including the driver theory test, and the application of penalty points and disqualifications is monitored. In regard to vehicles, a wide range of functions relating to vehicle standards, which are technical in nature and include type approval and construction, equipment and use standards, will transfer to the road safety authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The road safety authority will carry out the road safety functions of the National Safety Council. The authority's primary focus will be to promote greater coherence in the advancement of road safety generally. It will adopt the lead role in respect of the promotion of road safety awareness by building on the excellent work of the National Safety Council. The authority will also take on the enforcement functions under the Road Transport Act 1986 relating to enforcement of road haulage licences, the working time directive, driver hours and digital tachographs.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Crucially, the clear legislative provision in section 7 ensures that the authority has a lead role in the development of strategies and measures to advance the road safety agenda. Road safety comes under the remit of various Departments and agencies. In consideration of its very extensive remit, the authority will be in a position to engage with all of those contributory bodies in order to develop and monitor the delivery of a comprehensive road safety programme. The authority will play a major role in the development of future road safety strategies and will submit its programme for approval by the Minister. The authority will also have a role in overseeing the implementation of the Government's road safety strategies and, in that context, will report regularly to the Cabinet sub-committee on road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I also envisage that the road safety authority will compile reports that address policy recommendations across a range of road safety measures. In this context section 8, which empowers the authority to collect data relating to road safety, will assist it in carrying out road safety research. The aim of this provision is to provide for the co-operation of all relevant agencies in supporting this area of the authority's overall range of functions. This will add value to our current statistical base and the information collected will facilitate the development of future road safety strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">As part of its extended remit, the authority is empowered under section 6, in addition to its general duty to promote better driving standards, to take an active role in the development of regulatory proposals in the areas of vehicle standards and testing, driving testing and licensing, speed limits and control of traffic. While the power to make regulations will remain with the Minister, the authority will be expected to provide the necessary technical and administrative expertise and to take an active role in the development of regulatory proposals in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The staff of the authority may attend EU and other international meetings on behalf of the State. This is particularly relevant in the areas of vehicle standards, driving testing and licensing and road haulage, where EU directives apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">A major area of work for the RSA will be the delivery of the driving test. In recent years the driving test has been improved and the parameters for the test reflect the high standards laid down in EU directives on driving licences. This is facilitating the recognition of Irish driving licences in the EU and internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The driving test must determine whether an applicant is competent to drive a vehicle safely and with due regard for the safety and convenience of others. After successful completion of an oral and practical road test, a certificate of competency is granted indicating the necessary standard of driving has been reached. This certificate is then submitted to the local licensing authority which grants the individual a driving licence for the appropriate category of vehicle. The role of the driving testing service in ensuring that drivers reach an acceptable level of competence is important in the context of road safety. Driver competence and formation are an important part of the Government's road safety strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The number of applications for driving tests has fluctuated considerably in recent years. Between 1998 and 2002 considerable additional resources were invested the driving test service and waiting times fell to an average of ten weeks in the latter half of 2002. However, the current waiting time problem started in 2003 when an exceptionally high number of driving test applications were made to the Department in response to concerns about the possibility of stricter regulation of the use and renewal of provisional driving licences which was being reported in the media. In 2003, applications rose to an unprecedented 233,889, which was an increase of 22% over the previous record of 192,016 applications in 2002. Applications in 2004 and 2005 reduced to 177,000 in each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">As the Minister for Transport has indicated on a number of occasions, the delay in providing driving tests is a matter of regret. The delay not only represents a poor service to the public but is also hampering the development of initiatives which the Government wishes to pursue in the interests of road safety. The driving test and those who deliver it are a key element in the road safety strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Our objective is to eliminate the backlog of driving tests by the middle of 2007 and the Department has developed a package of measures, in consultation with staff interests, to achieve this. Additional staff have been made available to the driving test service. To date, seven additional testers have been trained and are carrying out tests while a further ten driving testers are due to commence training shortly. I am pleased to acknowledge that a very high number of the existing driving testers have indicated they will participate in a bonus scheme which commenced in February and will make a significant contribution to the reduction of the backlog.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">An important element of the package of measures to reduce the backlog was a proposal to contract out a set number of driving tests. The Civil Service Arbitration Board has determined that, otherwise than by agreement, the contracting out of core work of driving testers to a private firm is not contemplated or permitted by the provisions of paragraph 21.9 or by any other provision of Sustaining Progress. However, the board urged a resumption of discussions at which all options should be considered to ensure that a solution is implemented without delay. Departmental officials are currently in discussions with the unions regarding the way forward with a view to dealing with the backlog by the middle of 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I am very conscious of the need to provide a testing service which can offer tests within a reasonable period of time. The establishment of the road safety authority, which will have the necessary flexibility to respond to variations in demand, is essential to the improved delivery of the driving test.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">There have been a number of improvements to the driving test in recent years, most notably the introduction of a detailed report sheet that shows the test candidate where his or her driving skills are weak. The on-line application facility has proved popular since its introduction. In addition, a motorcycle test with radio communication between the tester and the candidate has been introduced. This enables the driving tester to carry out a much improved test and has been well received by both testers and test candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I draw the attention of the House to the proposal that the authority will be responsible for the registration of driving instructors. Driving instructors are not currently regulated. Proposals have been developed by the Department for the regulation and quality assurance of driving instruction that will involve a test of the competence of individual instructors. A working group comprising representatives of my Department and driving instruction interests has formulated the design of the standard that a driving instructor must meet. It will be a matter for the authority to determine how best to fulfil its obligations in carrying out its function in this area. In any event, the end result will be a register of driving instructors held by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Instructors on the register will have passed appropriate tests of competence to instruct, which will be the responsibility of the authority to administer. Prospective instructors will have to demonstrate that they have appropriate instructional skills in addition to demonstrating their general driving competencies. A consultation paper setting out the Department's proposals in this regard will be published shortly. I am aware that many existing driving instructors, who have been instructing for many years, are concerned as to how the proposals to regulate their profession will affect them. In this regard, I am of the view that, in the interests of ensuring that an appropriate standard of instruction applies throughout the country, all instructors must demonstrate they have reached the required standard. During a period of transition, when all new instructors will have to undergo the appropriate tests in order to instruct, existing instructors who can show they are bona fide instructors will be allowed to continue instructing before having to undergo the appropriate competency tests. The consultation document will address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Driver formation is an important element in the Government's road safety strategy. The proposed system of regulating driving instruction that I have outlined should assist in the achievement of improved standards of driving and assist in the formation of drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">A related issue often raised in the context of road safety and the waiting period for driving tests is the number of provisional licence holders on the roads. Some misconceptions exist regarding the number of persons driving on provisional driving licences and the arrangement governing the number of provisional licences which a person may obtain. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the position. There is no limit to the number of provisional licences a person may obtain for any particular category of vehicle. The first two licences are each valid for a period of two years. However, in order to be entitled to a third or subsequent provisional licence for any particular category of vehicle, a person must have undergone a driving test for that category within the preceding two years, or failing that, have a driving test appointment arranged, in which case the provisional licence is granted for one year only.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Another misconception is that 410,000 provisional licence holders drive around without having undergone the driving test. This is not the case. In 2005, approximately 45% of applicants underwent the test for at least the second time. The overall pass rate for driving tests in 2005 was 53.6%, with the pass rates for first time candidates at 51.5% and non-first time candidates at 56.1%. Notwithstanding the fact that many provisional licence drivers have undergone the test, I recognise that the proportion of Irish drivers relying on provisional licences is too high at 17% of all current licences. We are determined to reduce this proportion significantly and the establishment of the authority would ensure that we can offer driving tests more quickly than at present and thereby reduce the number of provisional licence holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">As the waiting times for driving tests become more manageable we propose, as signalled in the current road safety strategy, to bring forward appropriate amendments to the driver licensing regulations to discourage long-term reliance on provisional licences. Nevertheless we should not assume that provisional licence holders are <i>per se</i> unsafe on the roads. There is no evidence to suggest that holders of provisional licences are, as a group, disproportionately involved in serious road accidents. In this regard, Senators may wish to note that of 310,760 drivers who had penalty points on 31 March 2006, only 24,843 were provisional licence holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">International research indicates that age and length of driving experience are more important indicators of the likelihood of safe driving behaviour than the possession of a full driving licence. Young people need to be encouraged to cultivate safe and precautionary driving habits, even after they have obtained a full driving licence. My Department's leaflet, Preparing For Your Driving Test, is sent to all test applicants and advises them that, having passed the test, they should continue to drive carefully and build up their experience in different traffic, weather and road conditions. The driver theory test introduced in 2001 has assisted in driver formation and has ensured that provisional licence holders have an adequate knowledge of the rules of the road before being allowed to drive on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Before going into more detail on the provisions of the Bill, I advise the House that the process we initiated to establish the authority is open and transparent and has been established in a spirit of partnership with all the staff associations. Consultation with staff interests has taken place. The forum is a sub-committee of departmental council where staff have been kept advised of developments and have been given the opportunity to voice their concerns. An interim board and a chief executive officer have been appointed. I wish them well for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I would now like to turn to the main provisions of the Bill. I have already outlined the provisions in sections 4, 6, 7 and 8 as they were amended or inserted on Committee Stage in the Dáil to reflect the wider remit of the road safety authority. In addition, section 10 enables the Minister, following consultation with the authority and any Minister concerned, to confer by order additional functions on the authority. Any such additional functions must be connected to functions already being carried out by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The authority, in carrying out its functions, will have a general duty, contained in section 6, to promote the development and improvement of driving standards and will be able to make recommendations to the Minister in this regard. This provision will allow the authority to develop its services in such a way as to encourage better driving rather than simply testing driver competence. I envisage that this provision will give the board and staff of the authority the scope to move beyond the basic task of testing and allow it to be more innovative in its approach to the development of better driving in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">While it will ultimately be a matter for the board of the authority to decide on the best approach to take, I envisage the authority taking a proactive approach towards encouraging better driving standards. The section also places a duty on the authority to conduct its business at all times in a cost effective and efficient manner and provides that the authority will have all powers necessary for the performance of its functions. Section 9 provides that the Minister may issue general policy directions to the authority on the performance of its functions and that the authority shall comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Section 11 provides that the authority may, with the consent of the Ministers for Transport and Finance, establish subsidiary companies to perform any of the functions conferred on it by this Act. For example, it would be open to the authority to engage in the publication or production of materials relating to the promotion of better driving standards. Any necessary capital need not come from the Exchequer but may be raised in the marketplace by reference to the commercial merits of the project concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Section 12 provides that the authority may, with the consent of the Ministers for Transport and Finance, hold and dispose of shares or other interests in a company and become a member of a company. Section 13 enables the authority or any subsidiary of the authority to borrow money, subject to the consent of the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, for capital or temporary purposes. The aggregate of temporary borrowings will not be allowed to exceed a limit set by the Minister with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Section 15 provides for the appointment of a board of the authority by the Minister. The board will consist of a chairman and not fewer than six and not more than 11 ordinary members who may serve not more than two terms. The period of membership of any member will not exceed five years. Sections 15 and 16 contain provisions on the appointment of a chairperson and ordinary board members as well as to the meetings and procedures of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Section 17 provides for the appointment of a chief executive officer. This officer will be responsible for the staff, administration and business of the authority and will be the person charged with the day-to-day running of the authority and the carrying out of its functions and will be answerable to the board. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the propriety of the authority's accounts and the economic and efficient use of its resources and will be answerable to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas set up to examine its affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Section 18 provides for the transfer of staff from the Department of Transport to the authority and the appointment of staff to the authority. The section provides that the terms and conditions of employment of staff transferred from the Department of Transport will not be less favourable than those already enjoyed by the staff and that scales of pay to which such staff were entitled will continue to apply, unless agreed otherwise with a recognised trade union or staff association. Sections 19 and 20 deal with remuneration and superannuation arrangements for staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Sections 23 to 25, inclusive, provide for the disclosure of interests by staff, members of the board and directors of a company which has been set up as a subsidiary of the authority. Section 26 prohibits any unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by members of the board of the authority, its staff, advisers or consultants. The section also provides that the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts will apply to the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Section 28 provides that the Minister may make a service agreement with the authority related to the performance of its functions. Funds advanced by the Minister under section 27 out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas to carry out these functions will be conditional on the authority seeking to meet the terms of the agreement. The service agreement will set out the performance standards the authority will have to meet in carrying out its functions. Section 29 provides for the keeping of accounts and the conduct of audits of the financial accounts of the authority. Responsibility for the keeping of accounts rests with the chief executive officer. The accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the auditor's report will be laid before the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Section 30 provides that the authority will make an annual report to the Minister not later than six months after the end of each financial year and also provides for the annual report to be laid by the Minister before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 31 provides that the authority may purchase or lease land or purchase or build premises for the purposes of carrying out its statutory functions and, with the consent of the Minister, may sell or lease any land or premises which are no longer required for these functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Section 32 specifically provides that the authority may make charges to the performance of its functions and the provision of its services. The level of such charges will be subject to the consent of the Minister. Sections 34 to 37, inclusive, provide for the transfer from the Minister of property, assets, liabilities, contracts and pending legal proceedings relating any functions transferred, to the authority; that existing contracts and agreements of a continuing nature will continue to operate; and for appropriate transitional arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Section 38 amends section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, which provides for the procedures to apply when the European Convention on Driving Disqualifications is in force. At a recent meeting of the British-Irish Council it was agreed that the terms of the convention be applied between the UK and Northern Ireland by means of a bilateral agreement between Ireland and the UK. Currently the procedures in section 9 can only apply when the convention comes into force across the EU, which is 90 days after the last member state which signed it has adopted it. This section provides for section 9 to apply before the convention comes into force. I look forward to the agreement with the UK on mutual recognition of driving disqualifications being in place by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I reiterate that the establishment of the road safety authority is an important step in reducing the unacceptable level of fatalities and injuries on our roads and I look forward to the support of Senators in the establishment of the authority. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport to the House and the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation. It is long overdue. The Minister of State indicated that with regard to the code of road traffic legislation in general, it is intended to introduce shortly a Bill to make amendments to the Road Traffic Act. That Bill would include provisions regarding drink-driving, use of mobile phones, speed cameras and enabling provisions to facilitate further reforms of the driving licensing system.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I thought there would be more in this Bill, but the Minister is clearly bringing more legislation before the Oireachtas. I hope the other legislation will be brought before us as a matter of urgency. I travelled to Australia with the Joint Committee on Transport and there is cross-agency compilation of records there. Much information is received from various agencies, and one unit of the organisation would compile nearly all the information and statistics are produced. We do not have statistics in this country so we do not have the information to go on. I hope the further legislation will be brought before the House as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">With regard to the Road Safety Authority Bill 2004, when the authority is up and running, will it be able to make a recommendation to the Government that a particular stretch of road of very poor quality — be it in Galway, Mayo or wherever — be upgraded or aligned? It may make other recommendations in the interests of safety; will the Government take that on board immediately and take action or will it be another exercise in dust gathering?</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It is fundamental that if there is a body such as a national road safety authority, it can make recommendations and such recommendations will be prioritised and be carried out straight away. The funding should be put in place, which is crucial. Otherwise, despite our setting up a national road safety authority, putting people such as a chief executive and chairpersons in place, it will be of no benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The Government's record on road safety is appalling and extremely disappointing. At a time when most European countries are significantly improving their road safety measures and succeeding in reducing the level of death on their roads, our level of road deaths in Ireland is getting worse. In 2005, 399 people were killed on our roads; in 2002 this figure was 23 less at 376. This year, with 150 people dead, 18 more than at this stage last year, it seems this year's figure will be even worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The picture is one of a worsening scenario of carnage on our roads. Yesterday, an EU survey placed Ireland's level of enforcement of road safety measures quite low down the scale of European states. In particular, it highlighted our problem in dealing with drink-driving and speeding. This survey once again identifies that we are going backwards on road safety. That is a reason I welcome this Bill and the opportunity to speak on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The Government will lay the blame for this level of death and injury at the door of personal responsibility. Individuals have a significant role to play in ensuring that one drives carefully and responsibly, and that the rules of the road are obeyed. The Government and State structures are also very important and play a vital role. In this respect, the current Government should hang its head in shame. It is not new to the fact that we have bad road safety measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The Government has had over nine years in office when it could have taken decisive action to reduce deaths. Instead, the Government has produced two glossy road safety strategies and failed to implement the key recommendations contained in them. We have been promised a number of measures from the Government. It promised the full national roll-out of speed cameras but, according to what the Minister of State said today, the necessary legislation has still not been introduced. It also promised the implementation of all 69 penalty point offences and the immediate introduction of a 2,000 strong traffic corps, which is vital to increase enforcement of existing road safety legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The Government promised an increase in the detection of offences such as drink driving and speeding and a complete ban on the use of mobile telephones when driving. A party colleague of mine is introducing legislation proposing a complete ban on hand held mobile telephones but on our visit to Australia we learned that there was no difference between hand held and hands free telephones in terms of their effect on drivers, which is interesting. The telephone, however, is a big distraction in a car, notwithstanding that some people say it is a great asset when driving long distances at night.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">We were promised compulsory training for learner motorcycle drivers, and measures to end the horrendous backlog of drivers waiting for a test. We were promised enforcement of the existing provisions barring drivers on a provisional licence from driving unaccompanied. The Government also stated it would introduce measures to ensure the proper qualification of all driving instructors, and that it would reform a driving test system which has remained unchanged since the 1960s. It also promised new rules of the road, which have not been altered in more than ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">I have mentioned ten measures which the Government promised to deliver to improve road safety and there are probably more. However, none has been delivered, which is disgraceful. Lives have been lost while the Government has dithered and procrastinated. Even the National Safety Council has repeatedly pleaded with the Government for the implementation of measures which could save 200 lives each year. That amounts to almost 2,000 lives since this Government first took office nine years ago. Instead, this Government and the Minister for Transport have allowed this important issue to remain on the back burner and only now, one year from an election, does it suddenly decide to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">One of the most significant contributors to the level of deaths and injuries on our roads is the poor standard of driving of our motorists. Irish drivers in many cases take too many chances when driving. They neither know nor obey the rules of the road and have poor driving skills and ability. However, this is hardly surprising given the fact that the driving standards we require of our motorists is at a very low base to begin with. On several occasions in this Chamber I have called, as has a former Member, former Senator Willie Farrell, for a driving code of conduct or a courtesy code for the roads. In England people will automatically let another driver out if they are at a crossroads or a side road. That does not happen in this country. In some cases drivers pass others out on the inside lane, as well as on the outside. One would not see that in England, where they have strict rules on overtaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The current system of provisional licensing is totally unacceptable for modern conditions. Currently, one in five drivers on our roads does not have a full driving licence and has never passed a driving test. Worse still, one in seven motorists has been driving on a provisional licence for the past seven years. This means that almost 300,000 drivers have failed the test several times and yet remain on our roads. It is ludicrous that someone can turn up to sit the driving test, fail and then simply drive off. It is bad for the safety of the learner driver and for the safety of fellow motorists.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Provisional licences were always intended to be just that — provisional. They were never, as is now the case, intended to be a lifelong passport to carefree motoring. It is time this charade was brought to an end. I hope that the proposed road safety authority, the subject of the Bill before us today, will sort out this chaotic system. The new authority must put in place structures to ensure that those on provisional licences can sit the driving test in a short period of time and can re-sit the test quickly once they have undergone sufficient training. The Minister of State appeared to suggest such measures in his speech today, which, if correct, is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">At the moment provisional drivers often have no other choice but to continue to drive on a provisional licence. This debacle, in which there is a several month backlog of people waiting for a test, is due to the incompetence of the Government. The Government has allowed nine driver tester vacancies in the driver testing system to remain unfilled for four years. That is not acceptable because it did nothing but expand the waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Minister is also negligent in his handling of the outsourcing of driver testing to the private sector. Last May, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, launched his plan to cut waiting times and the numbers waiting for a test. One year on, the number waiting continues to grow. Outsourcing of testing to the private sector has not taken place. This is the one measure which could have made an impact. The Minister will lay responsibility for his failure to temporarily outsource at the door of the trade unions, but the Minister surely knows that it is within his power and that of his Government to immediately resolve this issue. If the Government insists under the terms of the new national pay agreement that private sector outsourcing be permitted to deal with what is now an emergency situation we could resolve the problem. I urge the Minister to act immediately on this suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">One of the key functions of the new authority must be the urgent reform of the driving test. The current system of testing has been in place since the 1960s, a period when there were far fewer cars on our roads, speed was lower and road conditions very different. Today, there are over 2 million vehicles on our roads, more significant hazards and a greater variety and type of road and road conditions. The current testing system does not reflect these changes. Also, almost half of those who sit the test fail and are still permitted to drive away. There is also significant variation in the level of pass and fail rates throughout the country. This suggests a variation in the standards applied by testers, whose training must also be reviewed by the new authority. In Australia a person remains a learner driver for a number of years before becoming a full driver. Statistics have shown that if people do not have a full licence they are more careful than drivers who receive their full licence and feel they can drive away. There is a graduated licensing system in Australia and it seems to be a good system.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The high level of driving test failure also raises questions about the standard of instruction received by learner drivers. Regulation and quality control of driving instruction in Ireland simply do not exist and it is time for a new authority to ensure they do. Currently, anybody can establish a driving school. It is not even necessary to have a full driving licence, much less own a car. There is a real danger that some schools could be passing on bad driving habits to learner drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">It is Fine Gael policy that any driver presenting for a driving test must be able to show that he or she has undertaken a minimum number of driving lessons. This must be complemented by the application of high quality standards in the driving schools that teach our young drivers. I urge the Minister to ensure that the new authority takes on this policy when it is up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">When will the Rules of the Road be updated? The current manual is out of date. The Minister promised that he would prioritise this issue but its publication is no nearer. If we cannot get the basics right, how will we properly educate our drivers?</p>
          <p eId="para_350">While I welcome the measures in the legislation to establish a unified, strong body to tackle all areas of road safety, I am critical of the way this legislation has been formulated. The Bill before us establishes the authority as little more than a shell. It fails to clarify and comprehensively set out the functions, responsibilities and duties of the new body. These must be dealt with by ministerial order. I will deal with these further on Committee Stage. In effect, the new authority is at the mercy of the Minister. It will not have the power or authority to hit the ground running from the first day. It should be able to do this but instead it must rely on the Minister to delegate functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I am obliged to conclude. I wish the Minister luck with the Bill. We will discuss it more comprehensively on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DiarmuidWilson" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_352">Senator Paddy Burke referred to the Road Safety Bill and I hope to deal with some of the issues he raised in that regard later in my contribution. Road safety is about two things — first, bringing forward policy initiatives and legislating for them as necessary and, second, enforcement. The road safety authority is being established to oversee the delivery of key road safety initiatives. Initially, it was intended to name it the Driver Testing and Standards Authority, which was to deliver driver licensing and driver testing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">In July 2005, however, the Government decided to assign a range of additional road safety functions to the new body, thereby creating the road safety authority. That is the reason for the Bill before the House today. The road safety authority will be directly responsible for road safety promotional work. This work has been carried out to date by the National Safety Council. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the council for the work it has done over the last eight years or so in educating people, through television, radio and the newspapers, about driving behaviour and the consequences of breaking the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The authority will have the legislative and financial muscle to co-ordinate and advance the road safety agenda. The remit of the authority will be critical, be it through formulating strategies, advising the Government and testing drivers and vehicles. I noted the Minister's and Senator Burke's comments about the testing of drivers. A total of 177,000 people are waiting to do the driving test at present. Some 260,000 people have provisional driving licences and the majority of them have yet to apply for a driving test. The Minister cleared up the misconception that 410,000 provisional licence holders are on the roads without having undergone the driving test. This is not the case. In 2005, approximately 45% of applicants were undergoing the test for at least the second time.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The overall pass rate for driving tests in 2005 was 53.6%, with the pass rate for first time candidates at 51.5% and for non-first time candidates at 56.1%. The Minister also stated that the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence is far too high at 17%. It certainly is. The legislation before us is the way forward. It will put one body in control of all these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The continuance of the backlog for driving tests represents a potential threat to road safety. It is unacceptable that people on provisional licences, who have failed the driving test, continue to drive. The Minister also addressed the fact that anybody can set up a driving school in the country at present. The legislation will deal with this through the establishment of a register of driving instructors. However, the vast majority of driving instructors currently operating are doing a good job. They will be allowed to continue their work until the register is established.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I note from the Minister's figures that almost 50% of those who sit the driving test fail it. Something is seriously wrong with that. Either they are dreadfully bad drivers or the test is too hard or not relevant. How many of those drivers fail the theory test? I suspect a high percentage of them pass the theory test and then fail the driving test. Basic training should be provided for motorcyclists. Many of the people driving motorcycles at present are not capable of handling them so there should be basic training for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The authority will also be responsible for road safety research, data collection and driver education. I am familiar with the Youthreach programme in County Cavan. In the three Youthreach centres in Cavan it is compulsory for the trainees to complete the theory test. It should also be compulsory in schools and other training institutions attended by young people. That would contribute to safer driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The authority will be responsible for promotion and awareness of road safety in general. I welcome the establishment of the board and the appointment of Mr. Gay Byrne as chairman. I do not know him personally and I did not particularly like his radio programme but women in this country seem to love him.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">He has received a great deal of publicity and that can only be good. He is a straight talker and will take no nonsense from anybody, including the Government. That is good.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">With regard to the Bill, section 14(4) provides that each member of the board shall be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has wide experience and competence relating to roads, road safety, transport, driver education and examination, industrial and commercial matters, local government, the organisation of workers or administration. The board should also include a young person, given that we are targeting young people, as well as a representative of the non-national community given that a large percentage of road traffic fatalities are non-nationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Section 22 deals with membership of the board for Members of the Oireachtas and European Parliament. Subsection (1) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_364">(1) Where a member of the Board—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_365">(<i>a</i>) is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_366">(<i>b</i>) is elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_367">(<i>c</i>) is regarded pursuant to Part XIII of the Second Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997, as having been elected to the European Parliament to fill a vacancy, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_368">(<i>d</i>) becomes a member of a local authority,</p>
          <p eId="para_369">he or she shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I understand an individual elected to the Oireachtas having to relinquish his or her membership of the board of the road safety authority because he or she will become a legislator. I do not understand, however, why an individual elected to a local authority should have to resign. Local authority members deal with their communities. An individual elected to a local authority should be allowed to remain on the board until its term expires.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Section 30 provides that the authority will make available a report on its activities not later than six months after the end of the financial year. As with many reports, this may not happen. With a staff of 300 dedicated to the authority, it should be in a position to have its annual report published within six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Senator Paddy Burke pointed out that to date, 150 people have been killed on the roads this year. It is an unacceptable figure. Up to 399 were killed on the roads last year, 63 more people than 2003. That year saw the lowest level of road deaths in over four years. From 1 April, 31 new offences were added to the penalty points list, including careless driving, not wearing a seat belt and driving with no insurance. I agree with the list of careless driving offences. However, driving too slowly is not listed as an offence. This should be classed as careless driving. The case of an individual driving slowly, resulting in a build-up of vehicles and necessitating drivers having to pass them, should be included in the list of offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">An individual has 28 days to pay a traffic offences fine. If it is not paid after this period, from the end of the 28 days to the 56th day, the fine increases by 50%. After that period, court proceedings can take place. In certain cases, particularly where a driver is caught committing a traffic offence by a speed camera, it is necessary for notification of the fine to be sent by registered post. I am aware of situations where the first a driver knew of an offence was when a garda arrived at the front door with a summons. These drivers had never received the letter notifying them of the offence. The Garda had no proof of the letter being sent because it was not registered. Notification of traffic offence fines by registered post must be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Several issues raised by Senator Paddy Burke are included in the Road Safety Bill 2006. The Bill will provide for disqualification from driving for drink-driving, hit-and-run and insurance offences. The offence of driving with no insurance is included in the penalty points list but I always believed anyone driving without insurance should be put off the road. Senator Paddy Burke referred to driving while using a mobile telephone but that is also included in the Road Safety Bill. The privatisation of speed cameras is also included in the legislation. The Garda will be given the power to impound uninsured, untaxed or unlicensed vehicles, not only for State-registered vehicles but for foreign-registered ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I wish this important Bill well in its progress through the House and I look forward to debating the Road Safety Bill when it is introduced.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_376">Over the past while, the issue of road safety has been much debated. It is important to consider some of the issues underlying this. It has become a political football. I was a Member when the Government changed from one side of the House to the other. At the time, I had tabled amendments to road safety legislation to give local authorities the power to implement minimum speed limits on roads. It was supported by my then colleagues on this side of the House. Two months later when they were on the other side of the House, they opposed it. I take some Senators' views with a grain of salt.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I must admit I do not have a great record with dealing with speed limits. This is not a holier-than-thou speech but one of hard experience. I believe the driving test format is appalling because it does not test certain essential driving skills. There is no requirement on learner drivers to show any understanding of speed or distance for overtaking purposes. The fact that there is no overtaking manoeuvre in the driving test is criminal. It is the single most important manoeuvre in the course of driving and it must be included in every driving test.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The same applies to motorway driving. Learner drivers need to have some simulated motorway driving. I would be happy, as happens in some countries, for learner drivers to do a simulated motorway driving test on a machine. Very often one sees a driver with three quarters of a mile of road in front of them. When a driver on the other side of the road overtakes a half a mile away, the oncoming driver starts flashing lights and blowing the horn. That is bad driving. These drivers consider themselves the safest on the road but they do not have any concept of space or distance required to overtake safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The legislation I referred to earlier contained a provision which enabled the State to require all drivers to carry their driving licences. At the time, I said it was somewhat unrealistic but was pooh-poohed out of it. I was informed it was only an enabling matter and would never be introduced. It was introduced five years ago. I made the point that in order to ensure people comply with the law, it is important drivers have a durable driving licence. I suggested a plastic, credit card-sized driving card be introduced with all the information required by the Garda contained on a small chip. I raised it with the then Minister for Transport who told me there were problems finding EU agreement on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Regardless of any agreement, it must be introduced in Ireland, even if it means having two licences. It is not rocket science. An IT student could design, develop and produce such a card format in a month. It could be introduced in Ireland with the next 25 years spent getting the EU to agree to the format, rather than the reverse.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">We should also examine signage. The finger signs unique to Ireland are incredibly dangerous. A significant number of the accidents involving foreign nationals in this State are caused by the daft signage which makes no sense to anyone who was not born and bred here. Even then it is difficult to figure them out. In every country in Europe, a driver will see substantial signs on both sides of the road pointing to a turn, not a small sign pointing in its general direction. We should have done this when we moved to the metric system.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Senator Wilson said that the fourth most common driving offence involves uninsured cars. It is a disgrace. I only found out last week courtesy of Senator McCarthy that it is possible to tax a car on-line by inputting false information on insurance because the system does not read it. The Minister for Transport should not listen to those who say this is a problem, it is not. It is a simple link where if someone inputs the name of an insurance company and a number, it is sent to the mainframe of that insurance company and comes back as valid or invalid. It takes about 20 seconds for Michael O'Leary to determine if he is getting the right credit card number. This is not new. I will be vocal on this because I know what will happen. Ministers do not like to look stupid so the Minister will ask a few questions. He will listen to what he is told and will accept it. He is being told lies if he is being told this cannot be done, it can. It should be sorted out straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The problem with speed cameras is that someone decided that a man on a bicycle must drive up to every speed camera every day to renew the film or the battery. There should be no need to open them except for an annual service. They should send the images back to a mainframe computer and the system should work from there. There should be no need for anyone to go near them. That should have been in the initial specification.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">There should also be a speed camera at every accident black spot in Ireland. In many European countries, there is a warning before every camera. That does not appeal to us in Ireland because we like to catch people, like the school inspector long ago, ducking his head under the window so he was not seen arriving. If people are told cameras are in place, they will act more realistically. We should not be trying to catch people, we should be trying to slow them down.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Right turns should be banned from all national roads. The Department of Transport film which seeks to train people in road safety suggests that drivers should leave their wheels pointing straight ahead if waiting to turn right. That way, if they are shunted from behind, they will be shunted straight ahead rather than into oncoming traffic. That is wise but it would be easier to say right turns are not allowed, drivers must turn left and come straight across, with a loop on the other side of the road for entry. Other countries do that and so should we.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">It makes no sense to have the same speed limit on a sunny day like today as when there is a torrential downpour or fog. All over Europe there are two speed limits on signs, one for wet and one for dry. That is too complex for us apparently. We should erect these and let the courts decide on them. This is not rocket science, these are simple ideas that we should put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">There is no bonus for those who buy cars that are safer than others. It should be reflected in some way. These things should be done immediately. The speed cameras should be installed. It is possible to buy cameras for less than €100, this is all cheap technology. A speed camera should be in place at every black spot and we should ensure that no one can tax a car on-line without a check on the insurance policy. There should be no right turns, different speed limits for wet and dry conditions and the abolition of finger signposts.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">There should be some semblance of uniformity across Europe for road signs. At sea, a pyramid shaped buoy has a different meaning from a spherical buoy. In many European countries the same applies. In either Poland or Latvia there is a system where a round sign denotes an imperative but the opposite is the case here. Brussels should try to achieve some uniformity, it does not have to be absolute.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">If I am driving on a thoroughfare which also has a bus lane at 7.01 p.m. and I drive into someone, should I have crossed the heavy white line on the dot of 7 p.m. when the bus lane finished? How does the requirement to drive in the left hand carriageway apply to bus lanes? I do not expect the Minister of State to have the answer because I have asked senior officials the same question. Are cars supposed to move in at 7 p.m. precisely or should they continue in the wrong lane? We have no answers to these questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">There must be a review of the areas covered by the driving test. According to the driving test, a car should be parked with the handbrake on and the gears in neutral. Those of us who learned to drive in the dim and distant past, when handbrakes were a luxury, parked in the lowest possible gear to ensure the car could not be moved. Can someone explain why it is safer to park in neutral instead of first gear? This makes no sense. I do not understand many aspects of the driving test. People who learn to drive over the course of a year are complying with rules and regulations that make no sense in the real world.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I wish to see credit card-sized driving licences. Overtaking should also be added as a manoeuvre tested in the driving test. No one should be allowed on the roads until he or she knows how to overtake. We do not want people who need three quarters of a mile to pass the car in front. The problem is never the car drawing a caravan, it is the driver in the car behind who does not know how to overtake.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I would like to see a speed camera at every black spot and to see on-line road tax organised in such a way that car insurance is checked automatically. We should put an end to finger signs on roads and put proper European signage in place, speed limits should be different for wet and dry weather and there should be an end to right turns. These changes, along with some of the other suggestions I have made would provide us with a nice agenda I would like to see carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">It is appalling that people do not have a difficulty with the fact that a Member of the Oireachtas may not be a member of the road safety authority. There is no reason that should be so. I disagree with the point made by Senator Wilson that if they were to be allowed, they should be nominated. Why? There is no reason Members are not allowed on the authority apart from the fact that this is what the drafts people put into every piece of legislation. We should get rid of that stipulation. We are as trustworthy in this regard as anybody else.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House. We all know the terrible context in which we are discussing the legislation, namely the high number of people being killed on our roads. It is important for the Minister of State and his officials to hear our contributions. There are no experts guarding the secrets of success with regard to road carnage. If there were, we would not experience it every day on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">It is ironic that this Bill is being set up outside of normal Civil Service structures in order to deliver flexibility and focus. Current driver testing arrangements, which are seen as core Civil Service work, are a clear indictment of inflexibility. It is good that as a result of this Bill the RSA will be able to set up PPPs and outsource driver testing. This is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">We must focus on whether we have been placing too much emphasis on passing the test rather than educating drivers. I agree with the Minister's recent statement that a driving licence should be difficult to obtain but easy to lose. Currently it is difficult to obtain a licence, but this is not because we are setting high standards. The driving test fails young people because they must wait 12 months for a test. During this period they only serve time until they get notice of their test and then go to an instructor to cram in as many hours as possible to enable them to pass. They do not seek this instruction to make them better drivers, which could not be done in that short time. Young people are forced into this way of behaving. As a result of this system, they are forced to pay thousands of euro for insurance, but only a pittance on education.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I would like to see a change of focus to education. We should not be asking young people to pass the test <i>per se,</i> but to improve their driving skills. We should insist that a certain number of hours are spent on driver education. A brother of mine did his driving test in Germany 20 years ago. At the time it cost £1,500 to get a driving test there. One dare not fail the test there, or one then had to go to a psychologist to prove one was capable of driving in order to sit a second test. As a result of this system, people in Germany put more effort into education on how to drive properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Young people here fail the test, not because of high standards but because the test fails them. The current regime must change. Over the past 12 months the Minister has tried and failed to change the system and reduce the long delays by getting agreement on outsourcing of driver tests. I regret his attempt to change the system has failed because of union intransigence.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">We must look outside the box with regard to providing tests for the hundreds of thousands of people awaiting them. I suggest we focus more on education and driver behaviour. We could, for example, take a cohort of those who have been driving for more than a year but who have failed their test — possibly for minor reasons — remove them from the waiting lists and encourage them to take ten to 15 hours of lessons from an accredited instructor in order to obtain a credit that would permit them to drive for another year. We would reduce the waiting lists and get people to spend money on education instead. Young people would spend up to €500 on driving lessons to discover their weaknesses and be credited with driver education permitting them to drive under certain conditions for a further 12 months. We could, perhaps, have a graduated system where there could be a curfew on such drivers after 11 p.m. until they had built up more experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The current emphasis on passing a test and allowing those who have passed to drive under the same conditions as those with 20 or 30 years experience is not right. The more we consider the education route, the better it will be for young people. There are no experts in this area. If there were, we would not have the appalling mess we have on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Senator O'Toole mentioned finger signs. We cannot even get signage on our motorways right. I drove back from Portlaoise last Sunday and watched out for signs on my way. I did not see a sign from Portlaoise to Naas informing me of the speed limit. When one drives along the M50, one sees signs every few hundred yards. South Dublin County Council has 100 km/h limits, but Fingal County Council allows speeds up to 120 km/h making it difficult for drivers to know at what speed they should be driving. Along the N11 signage is even worse. Where we have roadworks on the N7, there are makeshift signs on every piece of machinery or pylon. How legal are those signs? I imagine they are illegal and wonder whether they have been agreed with Kildare County Council under the statutory process allowing the erection of temporary signs.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Senator O'Toole asked why no Member of the Oireachtas was permitted on the authority. Why is no local authority member allowed on it? Have they done something wrong or do they lack experience? Is it because, as Department officials have said, they could go down Grafton Street and select any six people at random who would fit this board and be capable of doing the job? Is this the type of safety encouraged by the Department of Transport and is this the reason for the mess on our roads?</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The contributions of Members must be taken into account in the setting of driving standards and the accreditation of driving instructors. I wrote to every driving instructor in Dublin last year and met many of them over the summer months. They said that for over 20 years nobody from the Department had ever had a meeting with them. However, they got edicts over time telling them how their careers and business would change. They are crying out for proper regulation because they know young people are going to them not looking for instruction on the way to behave on the roads. They are asking for grinds. They want to know how to turn a corner correctly. They want them to bring them to the driving test centre and show them the route. Effectively, they are grind schools and the driving instructors are annoyed about the position. They know what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">In the accreditation process, a system should be brought in where young people would be required to take a certain number of lessons before being allowed to apply to do the test. The position currently is that they can apply to do the test even before they take a lesson. They get the provisional licence, apply to do the test, wait for a year and do a few lessons in the meantime. A total of 50% will fail the test and they go back into the system but it is appalling. The Minister stated that the success rate the second time around is only 56%. If any State examination had a failure rate of 56% we would be asking if the standard was too high or if the students were failing to prepare. Both are wrong in this case. The standards are appallingly low. There is no night time or motorway driving involved in the process. There is no testing on those issues yet as soon as people pass their tests they can drive away. We are forcing those young people to pay thousands of euro in insurance as a result of our negligence. I appeal to the Minister to examine that issue in a serious way.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">We must consider the messages we are giving. We heard about the crime figures again today and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, said that the messages are not getting across. Gay Byrne is only in his job two months and he is frustrated. One can imagine how Eddie Shaw must have felt after a few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Some 40% of the surface area of a packet of cigarettes warns of the potential dangers of smoking — smoking can kill — yet one can drive a car, buy insurance and motor tax without getting any safety messages along the way. We all say the issue is about safety. Is it any wonder our safety strategy is not working as it should and that hundreds of people are being killed on our roads? We must find new ways, using cigarette packages as an example, of getting the message across at every stage of the process of driving, whether it is buying insurance or buying or taxing a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I am delighted the Bill is before the House. The irony is that it is providing structures that do not currently exist or that have failed. It will allow the road safety authority to out-source and form private partnerships. The reasons for doing that are focus and flexibility. We must ensure that young people are not allowed drive on our roads in an unsafe manner. The Department has failed them miserably over the years in not establishing the correct standards. Consequently, they have lost faith in the system and are merely trying to use it to pass their test. It is not about long-term driver behaviour. I agree with the points raised by Senators O'Toole and Burke about signage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_408">Some months ago I read an article in a magazine inquiring of the reader as to the number of people that had been killed on the roads in the United Kingdom in the preceding 15 years. The number was a staggering 58,000 or 59,000. It then went on to inquire as to the number killed as a result of accidents involving airlines based in the United Kingdom in the same period and the answer was none. The magazine was looking to promote air travel for obvious reasons but it struck me that in a sense the message can be turned around. It proves the relative safety of air travel but it also proves the relative danger of road traffic. If we were experiencing the level of carnage through air travel that we do on the roads, we would be talking about grounding aircraft and taking radical action yet there is a blithe acceptance in this country, and I suspect in others, that if one travels on the roads there is at least a significant danger that one will, at some point or other, be involved in an accident which may involve injury or even death. As ordinary individuals we must ask why that is the case. Logically, it should not be the case but it is the case, more so here than in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The relative statistics indicate — I do not want to go into them in detail but I read them this morning — that it is undoubtedly more dangerous to drive on the roads in Ireland than it is, for example, in the UK, Scandinavia or even France. It is also the case that we accepted for many years, until we introduced the penalty points, that, inevitably, the number of fatalities would increase. They have not increased in other countries. The statistics suggest that in 2005 in Europe as a whole they decreased by approximately 5% and they have come down by much larger figures in other countries. There is nothing inevitable about this problem, therefore, and there is nothing particularly Irish about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">For a long period we thought that the problem was the standard of our roads but the sad truth is that even as we have improved the standard of our roads, the number of fatalities has continued to rise. In the past week or ten days there have been fatal accidents on motorways, national primary roads, secondary roads and so on. It is clear, therefore, that road standards are not the problem either. In fact, we know the immediate causes of most fatal road traffic accidents — alcohol and speed. We have had a good deal of debate about alcohol, and I do not intend to go into that today, but we have not had anything like adequate focus on the issue of speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">In my circle of friends, and I am sure others will have had similar experiences, people have very little time for drink driving. There is a measure of social pariah attaching to it but there is nothing like the same measure of opprobrium attaching to speed. In fact, men who would never drink and drive, and who have little time for those who do, will happily boast that they travelled at 120 km/h, 140 km/h or 150 km/h on their way to Limerick or Galway to get there in a few hours. They have no sense of guilt or of doing anything wrong but the figures from the Road Safety Council suggest that by far the biggest cause of road traffic fatalities in this country is speed and those who are most likely to speed are young drivers. In terms of the public advertising that is done by the new authority, we must focus far more on the issue of speed and put the problem of drink driving into some sort of perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Again, we come back to the issue of enforcement. I holiday on occasion in South Africa, as I am sure many others do, and if one travels down the garden route out of Capetown one knows as a matter of certainty that one will be stopped or go through speed traps. It happens all the time. They are virtually constant, not in the same places, but one will be stopped on that main road. There is no such certainty here. If one travels from Dublin to Galway a dozen times the chances of passing a speed trap are not very high. The chances of anything happening if one does are even less. We must take the issue of speeding more seriously. We must have more speed traps, be they electronic or manned, and we must act upon them quickly; on-the-spot fines are by far the most effective way of deterring people.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The Bill primarily seeks to address the issue of licences. Following on what Senator Morrisey said about the question of provisional licences, we are in an extraordinary position in that 420,000 people drive on provisional licences, approximately one fifth of those who hold licences. That is an astonishingly high number. The Minister and his two immediate predecessors are on record many times as saying that is unacceptable and have talked about putting in place radical and urgent measures to do something about it. The Minister's contribution earlier contained those phrases also. I hope something good comes of it this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I acknowledge Senator Morrissey's point that there have been industrial relations difficulties which delayed the implementation of any improvements. That is regrettable. I do not seek to allocate blame one way or the other but it is something that must be resolved and if it cannot be resolved within the current structures, it should be resolved through outsourcing or whatever. One way or another we must get more testers in place. The Minister talked about having an additional six or seven in place now by comparison to this time last year. That is just tinkering with the system; we need far more than that. There is no prospect of getting through the ever-increasing lists if that is the sort of numbers we are talking about in terms of the improved facilities we want to provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Implementing a system whereby failing a driving test carries consequences is perhaps even more important than the need to reduce the numbers of people on provisional licences. Everybody is entitled to sit the test two or even three times but at this stage we must surely realise that something is wrong. Either the person in question does not take the test seriously or is incompetent and cannot drive. At the very least, we must tell people to go away and take a compulsory road safety or driving instruction course. There comes a point where if a person fails the test four or five times, which does take place, he or she must be forbidden to drive. The person can come back in a year's time after having taken a course of between six and 12 driving lessons and sit the test again but in the meantime, he or she should not be allowed to drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">We must also take the issue of accompaniment seriously. I am aware that such a course of action would not be politically popular, which is presumably the reason why Ministers have shied away from it. However, there is an overwhelming case for insisting that people who fail the driving test more than once or twice must be accompanied by another person when they subsequently drive. We cannot allow a situation to continue whereby people fail the test, drive away alone, come back in a few years' time and perhaps do the same thing all over again.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Much of this debate has centred on various elements of road safety identified by individual Senators. I will address one or two of these issues. The issue of cyclists is particularly relevant to Dublin. The former director of traffic in Dublin City Council, Owen Keegan, was at least conscious of the need to meet the needs of cyclists in the city. If one examines the record — one can tot up the kilometres — one can also see that the provision for cyclists is hopelessly inadequate and what provision there is does not, for the most part, work. One frequently finds non-segregated pieces of tarmacadam which may be a slightly different colour on main roads which go on for 100 m. or 150 m., a gap of 50 m. then appears where the road narrows and the cycle track resumes a few hundred metres down further. Often the track will have been dug up and not replaced if it is a different colour. In any event, it is not segregated from the rest of the road. Cycling in Dublin city centre is uncomfortable and frequently dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">We must examine European cities which take cycling seriously and seek to encourage it. The only serious way of doing this is by allocating some part of the roadway or pathway in a segregated fashion. Based on my experience as a member of Dublin City Council, I am aware that there is great consumer resistance to such a measure. One of the first matters with which I dealt following my election to the council in 1991 was a proposal to put a cycleway on Griffith Avenue, a wonderfully wide, tree-lined avenue on the northside of Dublin. All hell broke lose. Being a newly-elected councillor, I naively believed that cycle lanes were good, green and should be encouraged but the people of the avenue did not think so. I understand that they are still opposed to such a proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">If we are to take cycling seriously, we must acknowledge the necessity of providing a segregated piece of pathway for cyclists. People in Dublin would get used to it, as has happened in other European countries where cycling is taken seriously. It is the only safe measure to take because an unacceptably high number of cyclists are being killed or injured on the streets of this city.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Other speakers mentioned the issue of foreign cars and foreign drivers, an area where we must make progress. It is unacceptable that people from Northern Ireland or other jurisdictions in the EU simply ignore the rules of the road because any penalty points imposed on them in this jurisdiction will not be recognised in their own jurisdiction. This issue has been discussed at Council of Europe level but progress is needed. We must move to a situation whereby at least people in Northern Ireland know that if they infringe our laws it will be held against them in their home jurisdiction and that penalty points will be internationally recognised. Surely, such a measure would not require considerably more inventiveness or political will than currently exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I would be interested in finding out how we stand in terms of smart card driving licences because it would facilitate the international recognition of penalty points. I am aware that smart card licences have been in the pipeline for many years. Such licences would be a useful way of storing information in a way that would be internationally identifiable. The Minister of State can update us on progress on this issue. When I last examined it some time ago, the proposals to introduce these licences seemed to run into the next decade and I am unsure as to whether the timeline has become any narrower. This issue is increasingly important because we now have many more drivers and cars from other jurisdictions on our roads. Action is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I understand that one of the authority's functions will be to take responsibility for vehicle standards sooner or later. I am aware that the former Minister of State, Deputy Callely, instituted a review of the NCT, excerpts of which were published some months ago. I gather that the entire report was not published. Could the Minister of State update us on the status of this review? On the one hand, various aspects of the NCT appear to be niggling to the public and cause a certain amount of irritation, while on the other hand, it appears that insufficient attention is paid to some of the more important aspects of the test. My car failed the NCT because there was insufficient space on the licence plate to include the Irish version of Dublin. The very pleasant Russian man who carried out the test informed me that he normally recommends including a sticker but as there was insufficient space on my licence plate, I needed to get a new licence plate. These are the kinds of issues which frustrate people. One needs to be able to distinguish between factors which seriously affect safety and other cosmetic issues which do not really matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">This Bill is an enabling Bill in that all it does is establish an authority and allows the Minister to make regulations setting out the way in which the authority is to work. I hope the experience of the authority will be considerably more positive than that of the National Safety Council. Sadly, it appears that the council will be forever damned by the comments of its former chairman, Eddie Shaw, when he resigned his position. He effectively stated that the political will to ensure that the number of road fatalities was reduced was not there. If the awful events of the last number of months have done nothing else, they have ensured that this issue is further up the political agenda with the result that perhaps there is the political will to ensure the authority is properly resourced.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Mr. MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_424">I join with others in welcoming the Minister of State to the House. I welcome this Bill, which, as Senator McDowell noted, establishes a road safety authority and gives the Minister the opportunity to make regulations, which is very positive. Any measure which attempts to resolve what is effectively a national emergency involving the deaths of so many people is a positive development that must be constantly reviewed. The Bill is an important step in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">As other Senators have noted, one death is too many but at this stage, road deaths are out of control. If we recorded a similar number of deaths from air accidents, we would ground airplanes. At the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the number of people killed in certain years may have lower than the number of people killed on the roads but there were 3,000 or 4,000 gardaí and half of the Army at checkpoints during that time. Yet, the problem of road deaths is more serious on an ongoing basis so we must commit additional resources or introduce additional measures if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The establishment of the authority will be of considerable assistance in terms of the licensing system, vehicle testing and instructor competence. The register of instructors is a very important measure. Other speakers have addressed these issues in significant detail but the single most important part of this Bill is section 6. This section does not concern the administrative or regulatory setting in which the authority will be involved. The Minister of State's speech states that the aim of the section is to encourage better driving. This is where the authority's role is most important because one can introduce all the penalty points, signs or speed cameras one likes but one must address the specific demographic group of people who are being killed on the roads for specific reasons, namely, alcohol and speed. A wide variety of sources glamorise speed, fast cars and associated alcohol or drug abuse, which contribute to road deaths. This is the single most important issue facing the authority. I hope it will not be an authority in name alone but that it will get involved in innovation and the conceptualisation of new ways of getting young people to engage with the necessity of saving lives and acting more responsibly. Let us make it cool to be responsible rather than reckless.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Senator Wilson referred to Gay Byrne becoming chairman of the authority. I welcome his appointment, as he is a man of tremendous life experience. While Senator Wilson said he did not particularly like him, women over a certain age seem to like him. That said, let us not lose sight of the fact that we must focus on a specific demographic. While I do not doubt that Gay Byrne could do this, his role is to convince his younger colleagues in the media, acting and celebrity worlds to engage in the process. Ultimately, it is the likes of Colin Farrell, Podge and Rodge and the Sugababes who need to state that driving slower and more responsibly is the smartest and coolest thing to do. With the best will in the world and while it is welcome that Gay Byrne has agreed to take on this role, he could not sell the message to me, a 33 year old. We need to focus on the 17 to 25 year old age group, which I previously mentioned to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. I hope Gay Byrne can draw on his friends and colleagues, such as U2 and others, to help in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">As the Minister of State knows, the north west was lucky to host Rally Ireland. We are confident that counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and others in that area will host a round of the World Rally Championship in coming years. It was important that, during the event, there was signage all over the region that read: "Keep the race in its place". Top drivers and people from the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, FIA, were there. With the helicopters, Ferraris, Aston Martins and so on, it was like a Formula 1 weekend in the region. Young people were bowled over. If we are to sell the message, these are the events on which we must focus. I hope that the authority, through Motorsport Ireland and Rally Ireland as it grows and develops, will continue innovating in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">If possible, the incentivisation of younger drivers should be examined. For example, in return for placing governors in their cars to stay below a certain speed, they could get cheaper or subsidised insurance premia. I would do this myself. The possibility of using a driver simulator such as that used in flight training could be examined. I do not know how practical it would be, but as we innovate in pursuit of a successful conclusion to this worsening issue, we must examine the possibility. If it were reasonable to train people in simulators, it would be a good step. How much time have I remaining? At the outset, I intended to say that I wished to share my time.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">Senators O'Toole and McDowell referred to licences which stored information via chip and PIN technology, for example. This would be beneficial in a range of issues, not least of which is driving competency, but also all State transactions. I am sure this matter will arise in later debates on the register of electors.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I welcome the Bill. It is another step in the right direction but more needs to be done. The key is innovation. I am not against Gay Byrne's appointment, as it is fantastic for a famous personality to take control of the authority, but let us not lose sight of the ultimate goal. As there is a specific demographic, let us see the Gay Byrnes of the world engage with their colleagues who are half their ages and are of direct appeal to the 17 to 25 year old age group. I thank the Minister of State for listening to my points.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KateWalsh" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Ms K. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_436">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I have a few specific points to make. My colleague, Senator Morrissey, has spoken on the broader points of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I commend the Government on this legislation setting out the responsibility that is to rest with the road safety authority. It has a duty to promote the development and improvement of driving standards as set out in section 6 of the Bill. My specific points refer not to the responsibility of the authority, but the responsibility that lies with road users to improve road safety. I am at the point of seeing my own vehicle for what it really is, namely, a lethal weapon. Cars have shown themselves capable or taking life after life in this country and abroad. My fear is that, as with so many issues today, the element of personal responsibility is either overlooked or underplayed. This is the third time in short succession that I have spoken in the House on road safety and I assure Senators that it depresses me more than them to be making the same points.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">However, I am still not confident that the basic responsibilities of drivers, pedestrians and cyclists are being taken into consideration. This is confirmed by the 150 road deaths to date this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I am talking about the very basics, such as vehicle cleanliness and road-worthiness, driving with lights on and cyclists taking increased care. On the first point, it is crucial that drivers, particularly those of trucks, buses, lorries and all large vehicles, keep their lights, indicators and number plates clean and visible. The road safety authority must do its part to ensure drivers are compelled by law to keep their vehicles in the safest possible condition. Research has shown that dirty headlights can cut drivers' night vision by 50% to90%. The consequences for road safety are obvious, so it is not good enough to just clean cars and lights on the day of tests, when going to weddings or for Sunday afternoon drives. Ireland has seen too many needless funerals.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Research has shown that leaving dipped headlights switched on during daytime, regardless of the weather, reduces the risk of collisions. This is particularly the case while overtaking, when one travels on the wrong side of the road. Laws in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Norway and Sweden require vehicles to operate with their lights on all day. In Canada, this practice has been in place since 1989 and its Government estimates that the measure saves 120 lives per year. What consideration has been or will be given to applying a similar regime here? I have twice asked the Minister of State this question in the Chamber. The regime could be in the context of the legislation before us in that the Bill allows the authority to make such recommendations to the Minister as it considers appropriate to promote, develop and improve driving standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">In previous contributions I focused on the extra care that must be taken by pedestrians, but given the specifics of the Bill, I would like to ensure that another often overlooked group, namely, cyclists, is referred to. From an environmental and personal health point of view, I admire those who cycle as much as is practical on our roads. However, there must be sufficient education of drivers and cyclists to the specific danger cyclists pose to themselves and others on the road. The ability of cyclists to weave in and out of traffic does not give them the right to do so. I hope the road safety authority takes this and the other issues I have raised on board and I wish it well in its important work.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_442">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. Regrettably, he is part of a Government which does not enforce its own legislation or initiatives. Its every action sends a message of low priority in respect of driver behaviour and the consequent threat to road safety. Hence, can Members be surprised when some drivers pick up this signal and cause mayhem, injury and death on our roads?</p>
          <p eId="para_443">This leads me to question the extent to which the Bill will have an impact on road death statistics. If the ensuing Act was to be strongly enforced by the Government, the benefits for drivers would result in lives being saved. However, persistent lack of activity would mean continued death and carnage, as well as grief for bereaved families.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">According to articles in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, and other newspapers, a report on road safety in all 25 EU states has placed the Republic of Ireland in 13th place in terms of law enforcement. This constitutes an indictment of the Government. The European Transport Safety Council study measured the progress of member states in enforcing speeding, drink-driving and seat belt laws from 2003 to 2004. This is the first independent analysis of road safety enforcement across the enlarged EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The main finding for Ireland is that we lag behind in the enforcement of drink-driving laws. It contends that we have the second lowest number of drink-driving checks within the EU and this poor record was due to the absence of random breath testing.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Finland had the highest score, with "exemplary speeding and drink-driving enforcement records". The example of Sweden, which had the second highest score, brought home the reality of the problem of road deaths in Ireland. Last year, 450 people died on Swedish roads, compared with 400 in Ireland. However, the population of Sweden is more than twice that of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Much of the problem with regard to safety on our roads can be laid at the door of our spendthrift Government. Despite throwing away millions of euro on one fiasco after another, it has failed to set a budget for the road safety strategy, thus making it difficult, if not impossible, to gauge the performance measures taken on foot on the strategy. The Irish Insurance Federation has called for more resources to be devoted to road safety following a 7% increase in fatalities. I fully agree with its contention that road safety must be given the political priority and resources it so desperately needs before many more people needlessly lose their lives on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The state of our roads is disgraceful and lack of a proper road infrastructure in some areas, combined with the lack of proper road maintenance, are among the main contributory factors to our overly high level of road fatalities. For example, the midlands, and counties Longford and Westmeath in particular, were totally overlooked in the Transport 21 proposals. Consequently essential works on what are some of the most dangerous roads in Ireland have been omitted.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">I have raised the issue of road safety many times in the House, and have called for an urgent debate with the Minister for Transport on plans to improve road safety. Dangerous roads, particularly in the midlands, such as the N55 between Athlone and Cavan, the N53 between Kinnegad and Tyrrellspass and the N63 between Longford and Lanesboro, are at the crossroads of Ireland and constitute important strategic routes. However, together with the appallingly bad stretch between Edgeworthstown and Armagh city, which runs close to Senator Wilson's home, they pose a serious threat to the safety of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I refer to the proposed extension of the dual carriageway from Mullingar through Longford and on to Sligo. While this has been promised, it has not been delivered on in Transport 21. There have been a number of serious accidents, some fatal, on the stretch of road between Longford and Mullingar in the past decade. Whenever the issue is raised by local Deputies, the reply is that the matter will be dealt with when the dual carriageway is put in place. However, the extension of the dual carriageway from Mullingar through Longford and on to Sligo was not mentioned in Transport 21 and the people of the midlands have been let down by its omission.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Previously in this House, I have highlighted the death of a young man in my own parish, on the worst stretch of a county road in the midlands, namely, the Rathowen to Legan road at Ballygarvey. A large percentage of similar deaths on country roads are due to their neglected and dreadful condition. Sometimes, while a road has been surface dressed, deep embankments have been left on either side and this issue has not been dealt with by either the Government or local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">These roads were described as the "roads to hell" following a survey earlier this year by the Automobile Association. The roads to which I referred were highlighted, in addition to a significant number of other dangerous roads which are a major threat to our safety. The Minister of State should be in no doubt that the condition of our roads and the need to deal with the situation, come up repeatedly. Problems with road signage and markings are not dealt with because some local authorities are cash-starved, particularly those authorities with a low rate base. The survey describes the Edgeworthstown to Armagh road, the N56, N54 and A3, as the worst continuous stretch, varying between medium to high risk and very high risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">There was a major underspend on roads last year and many of those which needed remedial action were in the BMW region. Along with other Members, I have repeatedly called for a debate with regard to underspending in the BMW region. Although the plans for many roads and bypasses are in place, the Government has failed to release the money. Were such routes upgraded and improved, it would bring about greater safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Members should feel helpless and despairing when they learn that, on average, every garda in rural Ireland only arrests one driver per annum on suspicion of drink-driving. Figures show that annually, only one person for each of the 12,000 pubs in the country is arrested for driving offences. Even more strangely, only one quarter of that number are convicted. In any initiative to increase safety on our roads and to decrease road fatalities, inputs are directly related to outputs. If the Government does not channel resources into improving standards, the circle of low standards leading to high road death figures will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">However, as far as this Government is concerned, the message is that anything goes. While much legislation is in place regarding this matter, as well as in respect of law and order, it is not implemented. This is a serious fault on the part of the Government. More than 30% of drivers on our roads break speed limits and drink-driving is commonplace. In the past 12 months, more than 450 people have been killed on our roads. How many were underage or unqualified drivers, such as holders of provisional driving licences? The issue of unqualified drivers must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">A lame duck Government results in lame duck policies and when its lack of intervention and initiatives result in death, a change of direction and of Government should be sought. Our road death statistics are a crying indictment of poor Government and precious lives are being sacrificed on the altar of mismanagement. The carnage must stop and if the Government is not prepared to carry out its collective responsibility and do its job, it should leave office and give others the opportunity to take action to save lives on the roads.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_459">——and the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">First, I welcome it from the perspective of public administration. It is good that a discrete function such as this is hived off into an authority. It is a priority in its own right. Notwithstanding what one of my colleagues said, I am pleased that someone of the profile of Gay Byrne will chair the body. It will guarantee that what he says and does will get substantial media coverage, which is the point. The Podge and Rodge aspect might appear in some of the tabloids, but that might switch off many other people. There are pluses and minuses to this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I am pleased the authority will be located in Ballina. Part of the Government's decentralisation policy was that when setting up new authorities it would, in principle, consider locations outside the capital. It is one more sign that the mantra one reads in the national media from the Opposition that decentralisation is a total failure, it is going nowhere and so on is untrue because the authority is going to Ballina.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The issue of testing was debated on the Order of Business. I do not have a problem with any public safety function, whether it is rail safety, road safety, air safety or fire safety, being run by a public authority. Obviously there must be sufficient people to carry out the function. The Minister of State gave details in his speech of extra recruitment. I do not have the ideological point of view that everything is more efficient and better if it is carried out by a private agency. I hope I am not part of a diminishing minority who believe in the values of public service, which are particularly relevant where safety is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I note what the Minister of State said about disqualifications being recognised within these islands. However, he did not specify that it applies to penalty points. This matter has preoccupied the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. It is a meaningless exercise from the point of view of people who acquire penalty points on the M1 this side of the Border but who have Northern registered cars, and <i>vice versa</i> for cars from the South travelling north of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Substantial road improvements have taken place, which makes a contribution to road safety. While there is an enormous amount of work to be done, which will take at least 30 or 40 years, over the past ten years, the Government has put very significant resources into improving the road network. However, I fully accept there is a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I would like to make one point about speed limits, which may be counter-intuitive. If speed limits are set much too low in certain areas, it encourages drivers to disregard them, and this may get them into the habit of doing so generally. A notorious stretch of roadway is the Naas dual carriageway where no one that I observe sticks to the 60 km/h speed limit. Perhaps the speed limit should be set at a more realistic level.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I have always queried dual carriageways such as the N11 or, for example, the road all the way to Fermoy. In Northern Ireland, the speed limit on these dual carriageways is 70 mph. Given that we have something which is practically up to motorway standard, I do not understand why people are forced, in theory anyway, to keep to 60 km/h. The road safety authority should consider credible speed limits on good roads. Apart from anything else, good roads are meant to be time-saving, but this will not happen if drivers are not allowed to travel at a speed which is within the capacity of the road. Generally speaking, I am pleased to say there appear to be very few accidents on our motorways. The accidents about which one hears day after day rarely happen on motorways.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">We all read with great interest the comparative road safety statistics which show Ireland ranging roughly in the middle at 13th out of 25 countries. It is good in some aspects such as the wearing of seat belts but it is not so good in other aspects such as drink-driving. We must ask ourselves some searching questions. What is it that we as a people actually want?</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Many of us value the relatively easy-going culture that exists in this country as opposed to a Nordic-Germanic rigid insistence on regulations. I have listened to debates in various groupings where people complain about speed cameras on clear stretches of road or gardaí lurking near restaurants and bars. This is exactly what the Swedish police do. If, on the one hand, we do not want this sort of culture, perhaps we should accept that more people will die. On the other hand, if we want to decrease road deaths, perhaps we will have to do things that are very unpalatable from a cultural point of view. We must think hard about this issue and make choices. I will not be dogmatic about what we should do, but we must realise that there are not many easy solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Earlier in the debate, my colleague referred to having headlights on all day, an idea to which I would be resistant. I notice the countries she mentioned are all Nordic countries where the daylight is pretty dim during the winter months. It is not suggested that people should drive with the lights on in bright countries like Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean countries. Perhaps this issue should be examined further.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">SUVs are responsible for many accidents, and cause more injury to people who come into contact with them, which needs to be examined. While they may make the driver feel fairly safe, they are also high off the ground which means there are blind spots and children and so on get killed in parking spaces because drivers cannot see behind them.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">My final point relates to the experiences of haulage companies who drive all over Europe. In circumstances where asylum seekers gain access without the knowledge of either the driver or the owner of the company, heavy fines are imposed, regardless of the innocence of the people concerned. I am aware of a particular instance in Tipperary where a fine of £7,200 sterling was imposed for two asylum seekers who got onto a trailer without the knowledge of the driver. What can be done to protect lorries and trailers from being invaded in this way and having such severe fines imposed on them? It is something that the authorities of different countries should discuss because obviously it is very difficult for honest owners of companies to have large fines imposed on them.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_472">I wish to share my time with Senator Browne, who will take the last two minutes of my slot.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, to the House and I welcome the Bill before us. I hope the road safety authority will bring together many of the issues which have been addressed in a very sensible manner by Members today. I am delighted that the road safety authority will develop and monitor the delivery of a comprehensive road safety programme because that has not happened to date. One of the most serious deficiencies at present is the fact that we have very poor statistics about what happens in road accidents. The statistics are very weak.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I was delighted to read in the <i>Garda Review</i> of 3 April 2006 that the Garda Síochána is most anxious to start properly investigating road traffic collisions, which are described as “road homicides”. That is an accurate description, given that in many cases one could have foreseen the accidents because of the behaviour of drivers or the state or sort of vehicle being driven.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">We have poor figures in Ireland and accidents are divided very roughly into those involving car users, pedestrians, motor cyclists, cyclists and other road users. In contrast, the United States of America has, for many years, had a most sophisticated system, known as the US fatality analysis reporting system, which gives them a very detailed picture of what happened in each accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The garda who wrote the aforementioned article in the <i>Garda Review </i>said that if there was a camera, yellow chalk and a measuring tape in the back of every patrol car — which would not cost a lot of money — it would be of enormous help in the investigation of accidents. Of course, aerial photographs are also useful. Frequently, however, gardaí are trying to get the vehicles involved in an accident off the road so that other traffic can pass, rather than actually trying to determine what happened. I hope this particular issue will be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I would like to focus on pedestrians, who make up approximately 20% of those killed on our roads annually and almost as many again suffer serious injury. Of course, pedestrians must look out for themselves, but some are particularly vulnerable, especially with regard to certain types of vehicles. Elderly people and children are some of our most vulnerable pedestrians. However, they must use our roads, as many of them are not in a position to drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I was very interested in recent reports concerning sports utility vehicles, or SUVs, and pedestrians. We already know that heavy vehicles are over-represented in accidents involving cyclists. Based on figures from the United States, it appears that SUVs are over-represented in accidents resulting in pedestrian fatalities. When a person is hit by an SUV or a light truck, he or she is hit much higher up in the body than would be the case with a standard vehicle. SUVs are much higher off the ground so that it is the abdomen, chest or head that is injured, rather than the legs.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 states, with regard to pedestrian safety, that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_480">The Minister for Transport will make regulations to transpose Directive 2003/102/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 relating to the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. The Directive applies to cars and van-cars up to 2.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight and lays down the harmonised technical requirements for EU type approval of such motor vehicles with regard to pedestrian protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">As far as I am aware, nothing has been done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The strategy document goes on to state that "The aim of the Directive is to reduce deaths and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists by motor vehicles through changes in the design of the fronts (i.e. bumper, bonnet and windscreen) of vehicles." I do not think anything has happened in this regard either. The document also suggests that the Department would do something to address the issue of the so-called bull bars, which are on such vehicles.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_202" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_483">We have done that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_484">I did not think anything had been done. Certainly it had not when I last asked of the Department. Bull bars festoon the front of these vehicles in the suburbs. A friend of mine, recently returned from Australia, was horrified to see them. They are known as roo bars in Australia, where they were first introduced because of kangaroos on the road. I have not met any kangaroos, whatever about bulls, in Ballsbridge but people are driving around with their cars festooned with bull bars. The fatality rate, if one is hit by such cars, is very high. I suggest there are many useful actions we could take at once.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The Irish Medical Organisation suggested that purchasers of SUVs should be warned about how dangerous they are for pedestrians. Many are being used as family cars. The fatality rate for pedestrians hit by such vehicles is 2.5 times greater than for a standard car. The same situation applies for small children, particularly in the driveways of houses because, as Senator Mansergh has said, driver vision is very limited when reversing even if one has convex mirrors or a wide angle lens. Perhaps we should consider a more rigorous driving test for such vehicles, similar to that for heavy vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">It is appalling the way people persist in parking on footpaths, the only place where pedestrians are supposed to be able to travel safely. I was near a primary school in the Nutgrove area yesterday and saw numerous cars, including SUVs, parked all along the footpath. A friend of mine told me of a lollipop lady she knows who recently resigned her post because she was on the receiving end of considerable cheek from the owners of vehicles when she asked them to refrain from parking on the footpath, which was making it difficult for her to ensure that the children crossed the road safely. Courtesy seems to have left many drivers. We should do something to encourage a resurgence in common courtesy.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I was delighted when Mr. Gay Byrne was appointed to lead the road safety authority because he is a great man for capturing the public imagination. He also has the trust of large numbers of the public and I am sure he will be a great spokesman for the authority, which I wish every success.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_488">I thank Senator Henry for sharing her time with me. I was my party's spokesman on transport until October of 2004. Unfortunately, matters seem to have gotten worse in the intervening period, instead of getting better, despite the many excellent debates conducted in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, gave a commitment to examine the issue of the high fatality rate for motor cyclists on Irish roads. Motorcyclists who do not have a full licence are not allowed to carry passengers but many do so. Statistically, motorcyclists represent the highest rate of fatalities and I am interested to know what work the Department has done in this area. Has any prosecution followed on from the former Minister's comments in the House over two years ago? That is something that can be tackled at a practical level.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I apologise to my colleagues, whom I am probably boring at this stage, but I must reiterate my call for the Department to examine the issue of drug testing drivers. I am sure that when drink testing for drivers was introduced, it was laughed at. At the time, many people were drink driving and the concept of them not doing so, or drinking in a limited fashion, would have been ridiculed. The time has now come for a similar debate on the issue of drug driving. A report was published in the United Kingdom which found that 20% of young motorists take to the road every day while high on illegal drugs. A startling finding was that young people are now twice as likely to be driven by somebody high on drugs as someone who is over the alcohol limit. While the Minister of State has only recently been appointed he must urgently examine the issue of drug driving. He should at least commission a study based on the English example, or the example of other countries, to ascertain how big is the problem. I am sure it is far worse than we can even imagine.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I fully agree with what Senator Mansergh said regarding speed limits on the Naas Road. I travel on the road every day. The speed limit is 60 km/h, which is totally unrealistic. If I were to get penalty points while travelling on the road I would be extremely upset. Will the Minister of State examine that issue, discuss it with the relevant authority and revise the limits upwards? They are completely unrealistic. Travelling at 60 km/h would cause a crash. It would be an extremely raw deal for people to receive penalty points on their licences because of the temporary roadworks. Special leeway should be given in that case.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In a debate on road safety yesterday a call was made to reduce the alcohol limit to zero. I do not agree with that. Perhaps I am in the minority. This is a rural country. People should be allowed to have one or two drinks and drive if they feel they are competent to do so and are below the current limit. The idea of a zero alcohol limit would only cause more trouble. People need to go to pubs for social interaction. We should not cut that off in a rural setting. Common sense is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">I put a question to the Minister of Transport last week on provisional driving licence holders. We have more than 400,000 such drivers, almost 30,000 of whom are on their fifth or subsequent provisional licence. That means they may have been driving for the past eight years without either having sat or passed a driving test. That is shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I advise the Department that it should not issue statements about revamping the driving test. Its main priority is to clear the backlog. Otherwise we only fool ourselves. Will the Minister of State follow the example of the NCT test? If that test is failed, the driver can return a week or two later to put the car through it again. The notion recently put forward by the Minister for Transport whereby a person who fails his or her driving test would not be allowed to drive afterwards is only fine if he or she can resit the test within a short time period and not face another year-long waiting list.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_495">Most of the points to which I want to refer have already been dealt with by other Senators. I welcome the creation of the agency and I wish Mr. Byrne well with it. It is a bit of a cod to put it in Ballina, but that is another story. It will create an amount of extra driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">I hope the agency will have sufficient funds for research, which is very important so we begin to understand what are the real facts regarding who are the people most likely to be involved, what types of vehicles and road conditions are involved and whether it is caused by speed, drink or road design. It gives policy makers the opportunity to adjust themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Although this may be a slight trivialisation of the argument, I am struck by poor signposting, which I believe is a contributing factor to accidents. One sees it throughout the country. It is terrible for tourists in particular. One follows a traffic sign, is suddenly left without direction and that is it.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The NRA has done wonderful work in improving the roads, particularly those which I use to go North. One needs stopping places on the motorways. When I get on a road at Portlaoise, I have nowhere to stop until I am over the Border without going into a town. There is nowhere to get petrol. It is all very well to state one can go into the nearest town, but people tend not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I support those Senators who referred to the need for realistic speed limits. Where the speed limit is manifestly low for the quality of the road, people will exceed it. This brings it into disrepute. I am glad the Minister of State will contemplate arrangements whereby disqualifications apply North and South. He should go further and harmonise speed limits. People used to driving in one jurisdiction suddenly find they offend when they come into the other. If there is a motorway from Dublin to Belfast, as I hope there will be shortly, the same speed limit regime should exist throughout it. That is very important because of the nonsense regarding penalty points.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">On the question of drink driving, I have spoken with police on both sides of the Border who are equally concerned. I favour a zero alcohol limit. One should either drink or drive. It was stated that people should take a drink and decide whether they are competent. The fact that they have taken a drink might distort their judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">It comes down to enforcement. I have seen a good deal of driving in France over the past few years. French driving standards were appalling but one of the most remarkable occurrences of the past two or three years has been the improvement in standards. It goes back to Mr. Sarkozy, who clamped down for one or two summers. There is no greater deterrent or encouragement to people than the prospect of being caught. I commend the French experience which is quite marked. I wish the Minister of State well. He is going in the right direction and I will support his Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_506">I will try to finish before my time has concluded. I want to speak in this debate, not because it is part of my brief but because every two or three weeks I have raised on the Order of Business a variety of issues on road safety. It is worth stating that a great deal must be done. One of the most terrifying facts is that back in the 1970s, the figure for road fatalities was in the mid-600s. I am not stating this as a means to dilute the need for action but if we had continued on that route we would have figures of approximately 1,000 now.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Roads have improved because of investment. Cars have dramatically improved because of technology and NCTs. We are now trying to get the drivers to improve. That may well turn out to be the most difficult aspect because changing human beings is not easy.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Has the Government done any serious studies on quality assurance in driving tests? The fluctuation in failure rates throughout the country is well beyond what one should expect in any properly standardised system. I do not believe it is because the drivers in one centre are dramatically worse than the drivers in another. Like my party leader, I have no great patience with trade unions which attempt to avoid that. Everybody else working in education must go through a range of comparative studies, such as the way in which the leaving certificate is evaluated. There ought to be an appeals system. In every other area of training and education a person who fails has a process of appeal. By all means impose a charge €150 to discourage fatuous appeals but let us have an appeals system.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I want to repeat what Senator Browne mentioned, namely, that fatuous unenforced speed limits are worse than no speed limits. The classic example which comes up over and over again is the Naas Road. A parked Garda car in some areas on that road would slow people down. Nothing is ever done and thousands of vehicles surge along that stretch of roadway at 80 km/h or 90 km/h, many of them heavy goods vehicles. They are breaking the law as it would stand anywhere, as they are not supposed to drive faster than 80 km/h.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I have no idea what type of compact, unofficial or otherwise, has been entered into by the heavy goods industry and the State. The vast majority of heavy goods vehicles are permanently breaking the law, as the NRA survey indicates. I have driven in a queue of traffic, with a Garda car in the middle of it and heavy goods vehicles in front and behind all doing 100 km/h. Even with the Garda car in the middle nothing was being enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">There is a series of issues like the failure of enforcement. The greatest deterrence for people and incentive for them to observe the law is the prospect of being caught. There is no point in arguing that people have a responsibility, which they clearly have. We have a fundamental need for people to understand that if they do something wrong, there is a likelihood of being caught. There is a confident belief held by many people in this State that this is not so. According to the NRA, heavy goods vehicles represent 3% of all registered vehicles but are involved in 10% of all fatal accidents. That is the real issue I wanted to discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Another issue concerns gender. The driving test failure rates are consistently higher for women than men. The insurance figures show that claims by women are far lower than those by men. That again indicates that something is wrong with the driving test mechanism. The driving test mechanism should at least appraise the skills that show up in real drivers. It appears that women show those skills better, as the insurance companies have the figures as evidence and charge women less because they make and are the cause of fewer claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Why do women fail the test in greater numbers than men? It is caused by a belief that there is a degree of assurance and confidence that driving testers will expect and which they will get from brash young men but not from more cautious young women? Therefore young men pass the test and are more likely to crash, but young women fail and are safer.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I am familiar with a glorious anomaly of a test centre which has a sign indicating that there should be no waiting there. This means that when a person is being tested he or she cannot have somebody to accompany them because such a person would have nowhere to wait. Therefore, the person being tested is required to drive there on their own, in breach of the law. There are different anomalies, and the issue comes back to a willingness to enforce the law to its full extent.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_517">I welcome the Bill and its provisions. It is a step in the right direction and I compliment the Minister of State and his officials in bringing it forward. I will concentrate on a few issues. Senator Ryan spoke about heavy goods vehicles and Senator Mansergh mentioned having speed limits at realistic levels so that there would be a culture of adherence to them. Unfortunately, heavy goods vehicle restrictions are a good example of unrealistic speed limits being imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Approximately 23 or 24 years ago, when I was president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, we campaigned to have the 50 mph limit increased to 60 mph. I could never understand why it did not happen. As has been mentioned, most heavy goods vehicles will travel at 60 mph, which is approximate to the current 100 km/h speed limit. It is often not realised that heavy goods vehicles cannot get into top gear unless they are travelling at more than 80 km/h. It defies all logic to ask drivers to drive in lower gears, from an environmental point of view and every other point of view. If one considers speed limits in other countries, 100 km/h speed limits on two-way routes is very common for heavy goods vehicles. We should examine the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">We have sections of good quality dual carriageway, heading out towards Lucan, for example, or down the N11, with 60 km/h speed limits. There is no logical reason for this. One can travel on these routes without meeting a garda until one enters those sections. If a person observes the speed limit within those sections, for which there is no reason from a practical view, that person will not be caught for speeding. The entire thrust and emphasis of the issue should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I took interest in the comment made by Senator O'Toole in his advocating different speed limits for wet conditions as opposed to dry conditions, for example. There is some logic in this. If we start doing this, we would have to allow that experienced drivers can clearly drive more safely at a faster speed than inexperienced drivers. Likewise, the capacity of a car, especially the braking capacity, is a significant factor in the speed at which cars can safely travel. If we start factoring in these variables, it would be difficult from a practical point to enforce and implement limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I welcome the section dealing with the evaluation and monitoring of driving instruction. That is undoubtedly a key component in bringing new drivers to a level of proficiency which will make them safer and it is in the interest of all drivers. I compliment the Minister on this, as it was overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">There are three main points I would like to make. We all know of speeding and drink driving etc., but three factors would dramatically improve road safety. Slow drivers should be focused on.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_528">I was arguing that three elements should be introduced. The first is a concentration on slow drivers, as they are undoubtedly a significant factor. I have travelled numerous times on national primary routes where I have been travelling at 30 mph or 40 mph, and somebody in front, who probably has a full licence, is hugging the white line and not taking any account of a huge build-up of traffic behind them. People may then attempt to pass out three or four cars at one time in a highly dangerous move.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Other countries have dealt effectively with this by having a number of lanes for overtaking on periodic sections of the road. There are signs which constantly remind drivers that it is courteous to allow cars behind to pass, and when drivers come to areas where they can overtake, it is clearly indicated that a person should drive on the left unless overtaking. We have a slow lane here and a driver may feel that he or she is not a slow driver, so he or she remains in the fast lane. We should consider that matter, as people driving between two points are looking to do it within a certain amount of time. If drivers are held up it can give rise to much of the frustration and difficulties which occur on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Taking into account accident statistics and insurance premia for younger drivers, just because somebody passes their driving test, does not necessarily equate to that person being a proficient driver with experience to drive in a similar way to somebody who has 30 or 40 years of driving experience. In other jurisdictions I have seen instances where if penalty points are incurred within a certain period — two or three years, for example — of passing the driving test, the penalty points are doubled. There is therefore a clear imposition on the younger driver to comply. When a person passes a driving test, instead of getting an open driving licence he or she should graduate from being a provisional driver to an improver for perhaps three years. If such people accumulate a certain number of points in that period they may have to repeat the test. There should be some incentive for the younger driver to accumulate experience in a probationary environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Third, and most important, is enforcement. Enforcement should take place across the board but particularly in high risk areas and at times when accidents are most likely to happen. It defies logic that we cannot concentrate enforcement activities between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. and at weekends. We should target people who feel they can drive under the influence of alcohol with impunity, so they know there is a high risk of detection. If we concentrate on weekends and other high risk times, rather than just in the run-up to Christmas, we would engender the necessary culture of compliance. These are practical measures to change our culture and I know the Minister hopes the new authority will take innovative steps in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">We must also bear in mind something which is lost sight of but which is important for business. Traffic must flow freely, which should be possible at the speed limit. In recent weeks I have driven in areas where 100 km/h was the limit but the average speed, which I measured, was between 80km/h and 90 km/h. In this jurisdiction motorists can only drive at 60 km/h and it is an area on which we must focus because it creates a built-in incentive for people to break the speed limit when they get the opportunity, in order to increase their average driving speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I welcome the Bill. It contains many good initiatives and I have no doubt that in time we will see the fruits of it. I compliment the Minister of State and his staff in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_534">I welcome the Bill but it creates as many questions as answers, as many speakers have said. A headline in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reads “Safety strategy hampered by lack of proper budget.” That is typical of what the Government has been guilty of in recent years. There has been no joined-up thinking on road safety. As much has been stated by the former chairman of the road safety authority, Mr. Eddie Shaw, on a number of occasions. The article also states: “The Government has been criticised for failing to provide a budget and a way of measuring the performance of the road safety strategy.” That should have been one of the first things the Government did. Someone from the Department of Transport said we could learn from that experience for future strategies but that is not good enough. One can always learn from mistakes but having a plan and failing to have a budget to implement it is not acceptable.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_537">I will deal with a subject many speakers have raised, namely, the fact that there is no limit on the number of provisional licences a person can have. One can fail one test after another and simply go onto the road with another provisional licence. A person can be a menace and still have the liberty to drive. That is not right and must not be allowed to continue. Many drivers are menaces who cause havoc on the road. I am not saying that all are provisional licence holders but many are. That will have to be looked into as part of a road safety strategy because the current situation is a farce.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I welcome the section of the Bill requiring driving instructors to be registered. It is about time such a measure was introduced because at the moment anybody can set up a school of motoring or act as a driving instructor without any knowledge or training in instruction. Will existing instructors be tested as to their competence? It is essential that they also meet the necessary competency levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">We have so many provisional licence holders because of the farce that is the backlog of driving tests. The fact that nine positions went unfilled for four years shows how negligent the Government, the Minister and the Department have been in this regard. The Minister said that seven of those positions have now been filled and that ten testers were taken on last year. People on all sides of the House have spoken for many years about the backlog of driving tests. The current situation results from negligence of the highest degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I am pleased action has been taken on hand-held telephones but we all know that if drivers receive a call on a hands-free set, they must still take their eye off the road for a second or two to press a button, which is also dangerous. A previous speaker said all telephones were banned in one particular country. We must ban the use of hand-held telephones but should also review the use of carphones. It is important to have a telephone in a car at night for security and for use in the event of an emergency, but otherwise it should be turned off and stored in the glove compartment. The whole question of the use of mobile telephones in cars must be looked at, though it will not be popular with the industry. It is a contributory factor in that it distracts people's attention when they are on the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Then there are accident blackspots, which have existed in some places for a number of years. Some of them are being attended to.</p>

          <p eId="para_544">That Seanad Éireann,</p>

          <p eId="para_551">—the scrapping of e-voting due to a lack of public confidence, which the poor state of the electoral register has exacerbated;</p>
          <p eId="para_552">—the immediate setting up of a student summer scheme under which third level students would be employed for the summer months to work as enumerators in an effort to bring the register up to date as speedily as possible;</p>
          <p eId="para_553">—legislation that would make it obligatory to produce photo identification when casting a ballot; and</p>
          <p eId="para_554">—the granting of responsibility for the location of polling stations to local authorities, so that polling stations are located closer to new communities thereby encouraging more citizens to vote at elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The state of the electoral register is a total disgrace. The bedrock of any parliamentary democracy is its voter registration system which should provide a clear and concise record of who is entitled to vote in an election. It is extraordinary that we have entrusted the running of our country to a Government which, in an age of computerisation, cannot even complete an accurate list of the names and addresses of a mere 4 million people.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The maintenance of the register is a task that should not be beyond the ability of even this Government. We have a small population of approximately 4 million people. London alone has a population of 6.5 million, which puts the size of the task in perspective. London is just one city, so the task in Ireland should be potentially very manageable.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The Minister is charged by the people of this country to maintain an updated and accurate register of electors but he has ignored and neglected this duty. He has taken his eye off the ball and should be given the red card. Political responsibility lies squarely on his shoulders; there are no scapegoats. As I recently did with regard to the nitrates debacle, I call for the Minister's resignation. If this lame duck Government has any vestige of governance left, the Minister's head should be on the block.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">As the Minister seems to be unable or unwilling to accept his responsibilities in this matter, an independent electoral commission should be established to oversee all aspects of the electoral system, with the updating of the register the first task to be undertaken as a matter of urgency. It is sad to consider that a small percentage of the more than €50 million wasted by the Minister and his colleagues on the e-voting debacle would have financed a full overhaul and update of the electoral register.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">In June last year, the Minister told the House that there were 300,000 more names on the electoral register than eligible voters, mainly due to the slowness in removing the names of deceased people, the increase in the number of second homes and people moving without advising the local authority. Given that nothing has been done since then, one can only imagine it is far worse now, with estimates suggesting as many as 800,000 inaccuracies in the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">My colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in 2004 called for an explanation from South Dublin County Council as to why many people were removed from the electoral register in the run up to the local and European elections. Since the close of poll Senator Hayes was contacted by a number of people in the Dublin South-West constituency who were unable to vote because someone had removed them from the register of electors. This is a sinister development where law abiding citizens simply trying to exercise their right to vote were denied the ability to do so because a mystery person deleted them from the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">As the responsibility for compiling the register rests with the relevant local authority, questions must now be answered as to why and how this occurred. When someone is removed from the register there should be a clear paper trail from the individual to the local authority. We must demand that all local authorities explain to voters who were taken off the register exactly who was responsible and why their names were removed. Equally, the law should be reformed to permit only the voter to remove his or her name from the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">It is clear that the compilation of the register is haphazard and patchy. Little effort is made to get an accurate picture of exactly who is entitled to vote in the months before an election. Another key problem with the register is the nature of many new apartment developments. It is simply not possible to gain entry to most apartment blocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as, for example, it offers residents a great degree of security. In addition, they probably do not want a bunch of Government politicians turning up at their front door.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">Something must be done to ensure that these people are put on the register. It is already difficult to get young people to vote. They are busy, work long hours and, to be honest, are of a political generation that feels separated from the political process and, in many cases, let down by the Government. We should not make it harder to convince them to take part in the democratic process. There is no need for these massive inaccuracies in 2006. Other countries have had large scale apartment living for years and they can get their citizens onto the electoral register without much problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">It would be interesting to know the level of registration among new workers in this country. EU citizens are entitled to vote in local and European elections, while non-EU citizens can vote in local elections if they are registered. Figures from the North are not promising and we have no reason to believe the figures for the South would be any better. Only four out of ten people in the minority communities in the North are registered to vote compared to more than nine out of ten in the general population. This figure compares unfavourably with England and Wales, where an estimated 83% of the black and minority ethnic communities are registered.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Moreover, of those minority groupings that are registered in the North, less than half bother to vote compared to an overall turnout in the North of 64%. Among minorities in the North, almost a third said they did not know how to register and a quarter said they did not know they had to register. I urge the Minister to examine this issue when he or his successor hopefully takes on the challenge of sorting out the mess in the electoral register.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">It is timely that this issue is being debated as people hand over their census forms. Not only is the electoral register a vital electoral tool but it is, in essence, an annual "census" used by people such as historians, genealogists and others. EU instigated legislation, which Ireland has implemented, has curbed its use for the issuing of unsolicited junk mail.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The simple solution to the current fiasco is to automatically place people on the register when they have reached the age of 18 years. Employing the PPS number used by the Department of Social and Family Affairs would do this easily, provided confidentially is guaranteed. That guarantee is a matter many people have raised with me. Every person over 18 years of age already has a PPS number. When a citizen reaches the voting age, the Department of Social and Family Affairs could automatically inform the relevant local authority. Such a system would efficiently eliminate much of the confusion that reigns.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Employing third level students over the summer months to update the electoral register is a productive suggestion. With the academic terms of third level institutions about to end, many thousands of students will be looking for short-term employment until they continue their studies in the autumn. Employing them to update the register would not only provide them with a welcome opportunity to earn extra income but also engage them in the political process. Many young people are disillusioned by what they perceive to be the negative image of politics, the abuses of power and blatant waste of taxpayers' money associated with the Government. Involving them in the political process would give them a sense of making a difference by doing important remedial work on the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Legislation making it obligatory for voters to bring photographic ID with them to the polling station is a simple yet effective measure to prevent abuse of the system. In an age where people are used to producing photographic ID to travel, this suggestion is not tantamount to encouraging the introduction of ID cards but a simple and effective measure to protect the integrity of our democratic electoral system.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">This weekend one Sunday newspaper referred to one of the most powerful images in modern politics, that of Margaret Thatcher's poster of a large dole queue accompanied by the slogan "Labour isn't working". What would she make of the inactivity and wastefulness of the Government? How would she portray the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government? Citizens are genuinely annoyed at the shambles in which the Government has left the electoral register. It is time for the Government to get its act together to correct it.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_572">I second the motion and thank Senator Bannon for tabling it. The most fundamental issue in any democracy is the right of the people to determine its Deputies at elections and, consequently, who is in Government. During the last general election, in ten constituencies the last seat was determined by less than 300 votes. In some cases it was down to just two or three votes. From this one can see the crucially important task in devising an electoral register that is up-to-date and reflects the actual position of the electorate. Despite the money and personnel in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities, some political responsibility must be taken for the shambles of the electoral register.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">It only became an issue because <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> made it one. Ten months ago, the paper, through Shane Coleman and other journalists, began to make it an issue. Slowly the political system reacted and recognised it as such. The root of the problem on all electoral matters is due to the electoral system being ultimately determined by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. An independent electoral commission must be established. A commission must be charged specifically to report to both Houses and not to the Government on electoral matters. Governments, be they Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, are naturally defensive. Governments never admit to problems but hide them. The job of the Civil Service and the Government in power is to obfuscate. An independent regulatory body is needed to report to the Houses about the state of the electoral register. When the issue was first raised ten months ago, the Government claimed it was not a problem. It only recently admitted it is. The result will be the census enumerators going back into the field to compile the register. Why does it take so long for the political system to react?</p>
          <p eId="para_574">One reason I strongly opposed e-voting was because the proposal came from the Government. It is not the job of any Minister to propose such a radical shift in electoral procedure without consultation. The then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, with nothing to do, decided electronic voting would be a good idea. It would look fantastic and Ireland would be considered a big player in the IT world. That is nonsense. It is not the job of petty politicians to meddle in such an important aspect of our democracy. Inevitably people are suspicious of the Government when such a proposal is made. There is merit in Senator Bannon's proposal to establish an independent electoral commission to look after these matters. It is better than politicians, often here today and gone tomorrow, looking for a way to get themselves onto newspaper headlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Is the Government in favour of the continuation of the charade of e-voting? It has the opportunity to tell us where it stands on the issue this evening instead of hiding behind the Commission on Electronic Voting. The people on it have better things to do with their time. The usual suspects, the Clerk of the Dáil, the Clerk of the Seanad and others, were rounded up to provide protection for the Government on the issue. I do not want to hear from the commission. I want to hear from the Government as to what is its stance on e-voting. As the Progressive Democrats are against it, let them support our motion instead of trouping in behind the nonsense contained in the second last paragraph of the Government's amendment to the motion. The people do not want e-voting. Instead they want the system to remain as it is. The Government has already taken the hit for the gross expense that it put the taxpayers through for the e-voting machines. Finality and clarity on the issue is now needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">On 29 March 2006, I wrote to the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the granting of responsibility for the location of polling stations to local authorities so they are located close to new communities where they will encourage more citizens to vote in elections. I did not raise it as an Adjournment matter or on the Order of Business. Local authorities should determine the location of polling stations because they know best where the new communities are and how to put in place voter-friendly polling schemes. I received a one-line, complimentary letter on 9 April 2006 and have not heard anymore since.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">If the Department treats a Member with this type of disrespect, what happens to members of the public who attempt to raise more important issues with it? Despite the baloney of strategic management initiatives and the like to determine whether benchmarking should be awarded, seven weeks later I, a Member, have not received a comprehensive reply from the Department. It is a disgrace. Why have I been informed this evening that a reply is winging its way to me as we speak? Is it — surprise, surprise — because the motion is being debated tonight? Why did I not get a reply to my letter before this?</p>
          <p eId="para_578">My letter makes one simple point. In the new communities I represent in the west and south west of the city, local councils should decide the locations of the polling stations. There are up to 6,000 new houses; people are not connected with the area and do not know where to vote. The local authorities should determine where the polling stations are sited. If that means having two polling stations in one district, so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The Government amendment, however, completely misunderstood the point of the last part of the motion. The Government amendment has nothing to do with polling stations, it is to do with polling places, a different thing entirely. I will be told that it is a matter for local authorities to put together polling schemes — that is true — but the returning officers determine the location of the polling stations. In my letter of 29 March, I said that the law should be changed. It is simple and straightforward, the power should be given to the local authorities, which know best where new communities are located. Six weeks later I have still not received a reply. The debate is scheduled for tonight and I am miraculously informed that a comprehensive reply has been sent to my office.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I have no confidence in the ability of the Department to deliver if it cannot even reply to a straightforward proposal that I made with no publicity or fuss. We are in a mess in urban areas, particularly in Dublin, when it comes to putting in place polling stations people can get to quickly. The vast majority of people get home at 7.30 p.m. and only have two hours to get out and vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">We must get our act together on this. If the Minister of State introduces enabling legislation, I will put it through this House in less than two hours to give the power to local authorities to do what I asked in my letter of 29 March. We must display some urgency in this. Those who have failed us in the past, and they are still in place to deal with this issue because the Government did not establish an independent commission, will fail us again.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_229">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_582">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_583">To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_584">—shares the concerns about the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the electoral register, which reflect the challenges presented by electoral registration in many jurisdictions, as recognised by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in its study of electoral system design in 2005;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_585">—endorses the Government's programme to support and assist local authorities in working to secure significant improvement in the electoral register in the short term, through:</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_586">—updated and consolidated guidance to all local authorities,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_587">—the use of census enumerators, or other temporary staff, to assist local authorities in intensive fieldwork as part of a new register campaign,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_588">—provision of additional financial resources to local authorities to support intensified action on the register,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_589">—an early start to the register campaign for 2007-08,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_590">—new arrangements to delete deceased persons from the register,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_591">—better on-line facilities to help people check the voting register, including an additional on-line facility through the website of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government,</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_592">—an intensive public information campaign,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_593">—supports full consideration of longer-term options in relation to the electoral registration process on a cross-party basis;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_594">—acknowledges the importance of strengthened controls at the polls and, noting that current guidance, which will be highlighted to returning officers and presiding officers at the next election, requires that at least 25% of voters be asked to produce an identity document, accepts that there is a need for balance between this requirement to maintain the security and integrity of the electoral process and providing a necessary degree of flexibility;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_595">—notes that the Oireachtas agreed to the establishment of the Commission on Electronic Voting and that the timing of further use of the electronic voting and counting system is dependent on the progress made with the ongoing work of the commission, the Government's programme of further assessment, testing and validation of the system, the associated decisions arising in this regard, and dates at which future polls may be held; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_596">—notes that the Electoral Act 1992, in accordance with the principle of local responsibility, already provides that each local authority, in consultation with the relevant returning officer(s), is required to make a polling scheme dividing the county or city into polling districts and appointing a polling place for each polling district, and that this is a reserved function of the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to discuss this issue, which, as spokesman on the environment for my party, I have raised on a number of occasions, particularly the use of enumerators to compile an accurate register.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">An accurate register is the basis of democracy and concerns were voiced in the Dáil about it, with the Taoiseach noting 80 people registered to vote in one house in his constituency. These concerns are not new and not even unique to the Republic of Ireland; the same issue has been raised in Northern Ireland, with efforts made there to make the register more accurate. There are also concerns about the lack of registration in rural areas. There was a gap of 300,000 between the 3 million eligible to vote in Dáil elections in 2002 and the census data for 2002 that showed 2.7 million voters over the age of 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I agree with Senator Bannon that only the named individual should be able to remove his or her name. I remember the lists given by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the two major parties in my constituency in the 1970s, to the register courts. There was agreement on the majority of names to be included but there would be hell to pay over a small number of names where one party would object to the other nominating a person to be added to the register. Those register courts saw a lot of politics. The political parties are not as active as they once were in compiling lists of names to be included in or excluded from a register. The rate collectors did a good job in the past, with even school principals providing the names of those who had left school at 13 who still lived in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">We must focus on what must be done between now and 1 November when the draft register will be published. From February next year, the 2007-08 register will apply. I agree that we must take effective action and I welcome the Minister's announcement of a package of measures to improve the register. He mentioned the use of census enumerators or other temporary staff, such as students. If local authorities could be assisted by these staff in preparing the next register, it would be a good start to an intensive campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Local authorities, however, cannot be asked to undertake such work without additional financial resources. That will happen and the Minister will make the resources available. In the amendment we mention the provision of guidance so that local authorities all work to the same template. The local authorities should also be able to cross-check the register with other databases. The new staff could deal with this. It is important to make an early start so that all information and assistance is given to councils. There should be an information campaign to launch this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The Minister mentioned that there are 30,000 deaths each year and that names should be removed from the register, something we do not hear about as much because we normally only hear about those who do not get a chance to vote. There should be an arrangement for that. In the amendment we mention an on-line registration process and search facility so that people can check if they are included. It is also important that there is a link between the local authority and the Department so the website can provide accurate results.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Events on polling day are important for both candidates and voters. We have introduced much legislation in recent years to prevent abuses of the system. This must be mirrored by vigilance by polling staff and personation agents on the ground to ensure only those eligible to vote are allowed. This is an issue that should be discussed with returning and presiding officers when considering their duties in the prevention of voter fraud.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Along with the question of inaccuracies on the register, we must deal with what happens on polling day. We have provided strong powers to election officials in recent years. The Electoral Act 1992 strengthened the powers to affirm identity and increased penalties for electoral fraud. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002 introduced more stringent requirements for entry to the supplemental register. Previously, I raised the issue of the green form provided by local authorities for registration purposes. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004 made unlawful possession or use of someone else's polling card a specific offence. Since 2002, election staff have been advised in departmental guidelines to require at least 25% of voters to produce an identity document, an increase of 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">We are dealing with a lead-in process for the next election and must focus on what we can achieve in the relatively short time up to November 2006. We must have practical, realistic and sensible proposals to show the way forward. I agree with Senator Bannon that the use of the PPS number for registration is important. Senator Brian Hayes said we should have consultation on these issues. We must have consultation in order to have consensus on a system.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Fine Gael motion raises the issue of production of photo ID at polling stations. The Minister spoke about one in four people being checked for ID. There are issues with regard to ID checks. For example, this might create a difficulty for the elderly in nursing homes. We should have some flexibility in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">On electronic voting and the location of polling stations, I cannot understand how someone can say we should scrap electronic voting when we are trying to develop the use of information technology throughout the country. Senator Brian Hayes may recall the Kildare by-election when he and I were involved in checking the validity of votes. Perhaps I should not mention that election, but at least our candidate topped the poll. We would not have to examine the validity of votes if we had e-voting. The e-voting worked well in two elections. The mistake with regard to electronic voting was that there was not enough cross-party consultation on the issue. That should not mean we should scrap it altogether. It worked quite well and should be discussed further with the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">We have made changes with regard to providing access to polling stations. In previous years we sometimes had unseemly situations where people could not get into their polling stations without being accosted. The Government decided then that election agents and supporters should not be closer than 100 m. to a polling station. Local authorities should devise a scheme to ensure polling stations are in suitable places with access for people with disabilities and where people can have unhindered access to the station, particularly in the rush voting hours. This situation has improved and I hope this will continue. Some people say others do not know where the polling station is as a result of removing the supporters 100 m, but this is a poor excuse for trying to bring back the support teams to congregate outside the polling stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I welcome the discussion of this issue. We have the opportunity between now and November to take some small steps to improve the system and hopefully will have a better system in place next year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_230">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_610">It is good to hear Senator Kitt agree with some of what is in the Fine Gael motion. This is only proper as there should be common ground among politicians on what needs to be done. We all agree the electoral register is a shambles. <i>The Irish Times</i> reported today that between 300,000 and 800,000 names on the register should not be on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">As Senator Kitt said, we are very dependent on officials for the register. This is a reason I agree with Senators Bannon and Brian Hayes on the need for an independent electoral commission. We are dependent on officials to keep the register accurate. I agree with Senator Kitt that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been less active in recent years with regard to detailed examination of the register. Both parties used to be more active on this. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">We must ensure clear guidelines and instructions are given by the Department to all local authorities. Much of the content of our motion is basic common sense as are many of the suggestions in the Government amendment. Between us, we should be able to devise what should be done in the best interest of all. We did well to remove those with political interests from polling stations, thereby ending the intimidation many voters felt occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">We cannot get away from the seriousness of the issue of the electoral register. Today's editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> states: “The Government’s lackadaisical attitude to the integrity of the electoral register and abuse of the democratic system has been nothing short of shameful”. We all agree that there are gross inaccuracies that cannot be ignored. It is a basic duty of Government to ensure the register is correct. We will never get 100% accuracy as people will always move house or location. It is a significant failure of the Administration that the register is in the state in which we find it today. This could easily influence the composition of a future Government, which would be appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">We know the potential for abuse exists. The Government's responsibility is to protect democracy and correct the electoral register and we will support it on that. We are all together in that sense. There are various reports on the figures, but they are significant whether we go for the higher or the lower figure. The inaccuracies are not just in one constituency, but in many of them. I do not understand why the recent Labour Party proposal to use non-confidential information from the census was ruled out. According to <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial, the Minister has ruled out the request that personal identification be required of voters. I look forward to hearing the rationale behind that.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The editorial further states: "... you cannot conduct a bank transaction or travel abroad without identification. Local authorities will not even issue a parking permit in the absence of a personal utility bill. So what is the problem about producing such material when it comes to protecting democracy and electing a government?" We need an answer on this. The editorial is damning in its final statement on the matter: "Their failure now threatens the very fabric of our political system and they must put it right". We all want to see it put right. That is the reason we have not yet heard any specifics on the way that will be done. We await the Minister of State's contribution in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">To deal with the points in the motion, if up to 800,000 individuals are inaccurately recorded on the electoral register, we all know what happened. Many of those, undoubtedly, are deceased. We are all aware of instances where the names of deceased persons were not removed from electoral registers. Forgive me if I digress for a moment but in the 1961 election in south Kerry the names of 40 deceased persons were on the register in a pooling booth in Glencar — I will not mention which of the three. There was something like a 99% turnout and, coincidentally, there were 40 "plumpers" in that box for a successful Deputy at the time who has gone to his eternal reward. That was only 40 names. How many are on the register now? That is happening everywhere. I fail to comprehend how the inaccuracies we are hearing and reading about occurred. There is great potential for disenfranchisement and voter fraud arising out of that and it is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure we have a modern, proper electoral system. We wait to hear from the Minister of State what is being proposed in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">What is wrong with the automatic registration of individuals who turn 18 years of age by utilising the PPS registration system? Surely there is merit in that approach. I do not see anything wrong with that but we will wait to hear what the Minister of State has to say on it. Like Senator Brian Hayes, I am strongly in favour of an independent electoral commission because it would ensure greater accuracy of the register. That would be its specific function. It is falling between various stools, so to speak, at present and it must be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">On e-voting, I listened to the contributions of Senators Brian Hayes and Kitt and with no disrespect to the eminent people on the commission — we will hear from them whenever they produce their final view — there are three basic things wrong with e-voting. First, there is no paper trail and that does not instil confidence in anybody. Second, and equally important, it was not designed to cater for the intricacies of the proportional representation system. It may be appropriate for a first past the post system if there was a paper trail, of which there is not, and as a result there is no confidence in it. If there is no confidence in a system we would be foolish in the extreme to try to tamper with it or even improve it, if it can be improved. Third, as Senator Kitt said, there was a total lack of consultation. We await hearing from the commission but I do not believe we will be able to come up with a system to cater for proportional representation with a paper trail in which people can have confidence. If there is no confidence in the system, we will not get anywhere with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">There is great merit in a student summer scheme. There is no mention of a student summer scheme in the amendment but I believe agreement could be reached on that issue. I do not see anything wrong with an obligatory photo ID. In addition, polling stations should be located closer to communities. With no disrespect to returning officers, who are often county sheriffs or county registrars, the local authorities should be better clued in to the areas where it would be more appropriate to locate polling stations, particularly if there was an instruction from the Department, which should be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Regarding the appointment of presiding officers, and this is a frightful scandal — thankfully, it does not happen everywhere — there have been some noted cases in various constituencies arising from the last election. It is an essential part of the function of presiding officers to ensure each ballot is stamped. Members will be aware, when the disputed ballots were up for examination, of the shameful number of ballots that were disallowed because they did not have the required stamp. That is the first requirement. The voter often does not understand that it is necessary. That is happening for one of two reasons. Either the returning officer and-or the polling clerk are dithering or it is being done deliberately. In either case it is wrong, should not be tolerated and any such person should not be reappointed as a presiding officer by a returning officer. The Department should make an instruction in that regard and ensure it is carried through, and that any such person is not reappointed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_621">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to speak on this motion. It is difficult to find major disagreement between the motion tabled by Fine Gael and the Government amendment. Valid points are made in both. The issue we are debating is above party politics. The inclusion on a register is necessary to give reality to the individual's right and responsibility to participate in the democratic system. An accurate register is integral to our method of expressing that democratic right. It is only eligible electors who should engage in the voting process and we must guard against multiple voting, personation, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">We all recognise that the accuracy of the register must be improved. The issue we are debating is what can be achieved in the short term to do that but, equally, it would be remiss of us not to admit that the current system is not working. We must take a long-term view, post the next general election, of the way we can change the method of compiling the register. We have two objectives. The first is to get the register as accurate as we possibly can between now and the next election and we should have a long-term strategy in that regard. We should not debate just before the next election how we can improve the system, or adopt a new system of compiling the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">There are many reasons the register is in its current state, including the rapid population growth, the physical development of the country, increased personal mobility and increasing numbers of gated apartment complexes to which enumerators have difficulty getting access. A concerted effort was made over the years to get people on the register and not necessarily to remove those who should not be on the register — those who have moved, are deceased or have emigrated. Some people, particularly those in the 18 to 25 age category, are unable to vote because they are not on the register of electors. Based on the 2002 census, approximately 500,000 people aged between 18 and 25 are eligible to vote but research carried out by the National Youth Council of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office in recent years suggests that approximately 20% of that group may not be registered to vote and as many as 100,000 of the 0.5 million young people who have a right to vote may not be on the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">There are discrepancies of some 300,000 between the number of people on the register in 2002 and the census figure of 2002. I am concerned about people being on the register who should not be on it. I am concerned about people in the Border counties coming across the Border and registering. We are open to that practice. A number of solutions have been suggested. The local authorities are legally tasked with compiling the register. Do they have the time, the resources and the expertise to do it?</p>
          <p eId="para_625">In the past, when the system was based on rate collectors, there was a vested interest for the local authority in compiling the register. Local authorities have a vested interest in collecting charges. If a person does not pay his or her local authority charges, his or her bin will not be collected. The system works because local authorities have a financial interest in ensuring that it works. What financial interest do local authorities have in the compilation of the register? When we talk about making more resources available to local authorities, we should do so in a way that rewards them for accuracy. Alternatively, in the longer term, we should consider franchising out this process, be it to An Post or an independent commission, although I accept that this cannot be done before the next general election. There must be an attractive financial incentive for the agency compiling the register for it to deliver a degree of accuracy in the interests of our democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">It is a pity that the recent Labour Party Private Member's Bill was unworkable for a number of key reasons. One received the impression that the Bill would have created an all-powerful quango. The use of PPS numbers in compiling the register has been raised in this debate but it would present difficulties because not everyone has a PPS number. Going down this road in the short term between now and the next general election would not achieve the desired degree of accuracy. This does not mean that it should not be adopted as a strategy to include people in the long term. Under such a strategy, a person would be automatically entered on to the register once he or she received his or her PPS number.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">A number of commentators have spoken about the use of photo identification. It is interesting that the people who promote the use of photo identification, with which I agree, raise the spectre of Big Brother whenever the introduction of national identity cards is mooted. A national identity card system has worked well for many years in France and the UK is considering adopting such a system. We may be forced to go down that road because of freedom of movement between this jurisdiction and the UK. If we are forced to introduce identity cards, will they make the compilation of the electoral register easier? People must produce personal identification if they wish to obtain an ESB connection and many other services yet if they wish to exercise their democratic right to vote, they do not have to produce such identification in all cases. We must examine this issue seriously. We cannot speak out of both sides of our mouths about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The Government is determined to take action between now and the next general election and local authorities must make a concentrated effort to improve the register. However, it is not sufficient to leave it at that. The package announced by the Government, which contains some very straightforward proposals, is welcome. Among these proposals are the use of census enumerators or other temporary personnel, such as the student scheme proposed in the motion, to gather information. From my practical experience as a politician who has spent time knocking on doors, such information gathering must take place during the evening. It is impossible for people to collect this information during the day because they will only obtain a 20% to 30% response. A higher response rate and concomitant accuracy can only be achieved by gathering information late in the evening between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Increased ring-fenced financial resources for local authorities to allow them to update the register are important. It again reinforces my point about making it financially attractive for local authorities to update the register. We should be able to link the register to every time a member of the public comes into contact with the State through agency like the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners. We and these agencies can interface with the public in an effort to keep the register accurate by including one more question on whatever forms members of the public are filling in or compiling. Given the existence of modern databases, why can this question not be forwarded to the relevant local authority? There should be a section or column dealing with the register in every form arising out of interactions between members of the public and State institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">New IT arrangements to delete deceased persons from the register have also been put in place. It is not acceptable that when we record deaths, we do not delete the deceased person's name from the register at the same time. It does not make sense. In our own limited way, we know the embarrassment this can cause when we communicate with deceased people using information from our own databases.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">This is a serious topic which is being taken seriously by the Government. I hope we can inspire local authorities to take it seriously. Significant steps can be taken and local authorities can do more even in the absence of new packages. For example, new local authority housing estates have been constructed but their residents do not appear on the register. It is inexcusable for a local authority to allocate a house to someone but neglect to put him or her on the register at the same time. The variation in quality between one local authority and another is not understandable. Why is one authority more efficient than another? It comes back to my argument that it must be made financially attractive to maintain the register. Local authorities do not slip up when they are collecting their own charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The individual also has considerable responsibility. He or she is responsible for registering himself or herself. No matter what action we take, we must run parallel educational and information programmes and provide easier IT access to check the register and enter one's details. I am aware that this measure is coming forward. We must continuously remind people of the importance of checking whether they are on the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Short-term progress on this issue is most likely to be achieved by gearing up the local authorities, working with the current organisational framework and pushing them forward. However, we also need a long-term strategy for compiling the register. No matter how much Senators might protest otherwise, none of us can escape the reality that we must work with the system we have. There is merit in many of the arguments made here tonight and I hope the Government takes them on board.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_232">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_634">I was intrigued to hear that the Bill introduced by my party was unworkable. All I heard was that our Bill would establish an independent quango. I paid a visit to Ethiopia last week as part of a delegation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs. That country is in a state of considerable electoral chaos because both the Government and the Opposition have claimed victory in the general election and many members of the Opposition are now in prison. The most clearly articulated demand of the Opposition is for a visibly independent national electoral board. This is the core of the Bill proposed in the other House by my party. This Bill would move away from any hints of peculiar budgetary priorities by local authorities. Drawing up the register is one of a number of obligations imposed on local authorities but in a constrained budgetary situation, it is far from top of the list of priorities for county and city managers.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">As an individual who has been presented with copies of registers by local authorities during all my years as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I was always intrigued by the lack of any sense of the need to close circuits. A form anonymously stuck through the doorway of my house warned me that I could not vote if I did not register to do so. That form reminded me of two considerations in this affair. The first relates to the people who are deprived of the vote because they did not register to vote or disappeared off the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The second, and of far greater concern, is the number of people who are on the register but should not be. For many years, there was indifference to this problem, but the suspicion that a particular party, which developed its expertise north of the Border, is now using it in the South may have concentrated minds. If anything dubious is suggested, this type of remark is calculated to generate extraordinary levels of pompous indignation from at least one senior party official.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">We could argue forever about the precise mechanisms to be used to provide a good, up-to-date, reliable and secure electoral register, but why has this situation occurred when the Government presides in a time of extraordinary affluence? Until 15 years ago, the excuse was that the country could only apply a certain amount of funds, but democracy is the bedrock of how we work. I should not need to say this in a House of the Oireachtas. Therefore, the most important mechanism or institution of the State is the process by which democracy works. When Ministers of a variety of political views get worked up about the need to defend the institutions of the State against attack, one agrees with them. These are the institutions we set up to govern the State, but what happens if the Government allows the most fundamental institution to rot and fall behind?</p>
          <p eId="para_638">For a long time, mobility was limited in this country. People either stayed where they were or left the country. There was a bit of movement between Cork and Dublin, as the Minister of State is well aware since his father partook of that mobility, but it was usually a once-off movement. People moved to somewhere, stayed there, got married, moved to another place and did not move much more. Now, we have a fluidly migrant population. More young people live away from home than was the case 20 years ago. There are gated communities to which no one can gain access. Three or four different categories of people are moving into and out of the country, some of whom are entitled to vote in local elections, European elections and general elections while some of whom are not entitled to vote in presidential elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">After so many years, why is the format of putting together the register haphazard, uneven and dependent on the whims and efforts of city and county managers? The Government does not need to accept all of the Opposition's suggestions on how to do this, but it must give Opposition Members and a significant number of Government backbenchers a sense that the same things will be done better. Adding €100,000 here and there to a budget that is inadequate will not work, nor will hoping that a few more people will be recruited and city and county managers, who tell us that they do not have enough money, will allocate a significant part of their budgets because we have made a fuss. Many other measures will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">One of Ireland's fundamental policy malaises is the degree to which we wonder why, after identifying pathetic or no resource allocations, something only happens in a half-hearted and sporadic way. Who will travel——</p>

          <p eId="para_642">I await the Minister of State's response. Who could disagree with anything in the motion? One hopes the Minister of State will accept the Opposition's views but that carries optimism too far. I do not want a hope for the best or a promise that the Government will try better in future, but a structured, funded and staffed plan to ensure a dynamically active and continuous review of the register instead of passing out a form once per year and waiting to see what happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">All sorts of phantom figures appeared on the register at an apartment complex in my constituency of Cork South Central. One man of straight-laced habits learned that according to the electoral register, a woman was living with him. He was most disturbed by this fact but was even more disturbed when he went to vote at 9 a.m. and discovered that the woman had already voted. The Minister of State has the resources to identify the extent to which such anecdotes are true. If the Government leaves the register in a messy state, one must assume it has identified some advantage. Presumably, the advantage is the fact that older people tend to vote for Fianna Fáil in greater numbers than younger people. Therefore, the best course of action would be to keep youngsters off the register while retaining older people who vote for Fianna Fáil, do not move and are easily registered.</p>

        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_644">I welcome the Minister of State and this debate. I disagree that this issue has arisen due to media reporting. For example, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government has discussed the matter for the past 18 months at least. Committee members discussed the draft guidelines in detail. In my local organisation, motions have been tabled and passed in respect of this matter in the past three or four years. The issue arises prior to each general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Senator Coghlan referred to a registered canvass, which my party thoroughly undertook in my area once per year. It provided much information and not only gave us an idea of the political landscape, but also the social landscape. It informed us of who had passed on, moved, turned 18 years of age or so on since we last called. This process can no longer be found in the majority of areas, which has created a deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">People have suggested a number of reasons for the register's condition but it is not in the level of disarray stated. There are issues with people being on it who should not be and <i>vice versa</i> but the problem has been exaggerated. According to last year’s construction industry indicators, 99,352 residential unit planning applications were granted and it is estimated that 83,000 houses will be built in 2006, which will be an increase on previous years’ figures. The census will prove that our population has dramatically increased. For these reasons, the register is not as complete or accurate as we would like.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Personation at polling stations has always existed in some form and Senator Coghlan referred to an election that took place in 1961. Presiding officers and returning officers have access to a raft of legislation pertaining to personation at polling stations. All Members will have encountered people coming to polling stations at election time.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">In recent years, my constituency has experienced particular difficulties, whereby people who came from different jurisdictions have attempted to personate, using polling cards which they were either given or which they came across themselves. When this was challenged at election time, the presiding officers took action in some cases and not in others. The people in question turned around and walked out of the polling station.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Although guidelines exist and effective legislation is in place, they must be enforced and implemented. In this context, the highlighting of this issue, in the media or otherwise, will ensure that there will be a spotlight on polling stations and returning officers in the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">As for unregistered people, some time ago my constituency was changed to incorporate what was then the new suburb of Cherry Orchard. There was neither a shop nor a telephone box in the area at the time. During the election, I examined the boxes from Cherry Orchard. One box contained 12 votes, while another contained 14 votes. We then had a discussion as to what should be done to encourage people to get involved. The local parish priest, Fr. Ó Cuív, who was a brother of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, initiated a process, starting with a local women's group, to educate them as to why and how they should vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">It was not. It was seen in the locality as being non-political because of who was behind it and how it was done. If the Senator knew the parish priest in question, he would understand why it was non-political.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Recently in East Wall, the Vincentian Partnership has begun a local education process. Last week, it held a public meeting on how to register and why one should so do, to which three people turned up. This issue must be examined and the role of schools must be emphasised. The civic, social and political education, CSPE, programme deals with politics and political issues. Members should encourage as many transition year students as possible to visit the Houses. Such students will shortly turn 18 years of age and consequently will be eligible to vote. This aspect must be strengthened because we are slipping badly, particularly with regard to second level schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I fully support the initiatives suggested by the Minister of State which are outlined in the amendment to the motion. They are not a knee-jerk reaction. This issue is raised at every general election. Anyone who knocks on doors or performs a register canvass will realise that the inaccuracies present are easily avoidable. A person who turns 18 should either be given an automatic opportunity to register or should be registered automatically, based on his or her PPS number. We should make use of the technologies available to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I wish to make a point regarding electronic voting. For the past four to six years, Ireland has been among the top three countries in the world, along with the United States and India, in the production of IT software. It is incredible that we are unable to produce what are essentially counting machines. This issue was discussed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government with a number of experts and every possible obstacle——</p>

Electronic voting is used in countries such as France, Germany and Holland. Moreover, as countries such as India, in which hundreds of millions of people vote simultaneously use it extensively, Ireland must consider its adoption at some point. I welcome and support the amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_660">It was also an electronic system. Moreover, Ireland has a high failure rate with regard to IT systems and the voting system was not alone in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">This is a cross-party task in which all parties have an input and to which all have an interest. Teachers, particularly civics teachers, should play an important role in this respect. They should visit the Dáil and Seanad for two or three days each year to witness the progress of Bills through both Houses and to learn how the democratic system operates. The great majority of teachers, who are responsible for teaching young people, do not have a clue as to how a Bill is taken through either House of the Oireachtas. It is not simply a question of educating the voter. Members must also educate the voters' educators. Civics teachers in particular have an important role to play in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Undoubtedly, major problems exist with the electoral register. Last year, before the November closing date, the Fine Gael Party canvassed every house in Castlebar town and dropped a registration form into every house. This engendered an enormous response and as a result of that canvass, more than 500 people in the town of Castlebar alone were registered. However, the supplementary register is not mentioned in the amendment to the motion. It is difficult to be included on the supplementary register. For example, before the last general election, I was contacted by someone from Naas, who was not on the register. The individual in question was obliged to travel from Naas to the Garda station in Maynooth to be included on the supplementary register. As nobody was present at the station, the voter was obliged to talk through the Garda's "green man" intercom system. Can Members imagine being obliged to use the "green man" system to be included on the voting register? The voter was obliged to go home and try again on another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Something must be done in this respect, because one is obliged to register at Garda stations to be included on the supplementary register. However, as many Garda stations, including some in our larger towns, are not manned on a 24-hour basis, this can be a significant problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I agree with some of the points raised by Senator Minihan. I also believe that local authorities have lost the incentive to register voters. In most cases in the past, they were responsible for refuse collection and rates. Hence, it was in their interest to register people, to ensure that rates were collected from everyone. That is no longer the case. When I was a member of a local authority it used to set £100,000 aside for election years, particularly for local elections, but no significant resources are devoted to compiling the register or set aside for election years any longer. This issue must be seriously examined because it requires funding. We cannot employ census enumerators every year to compile the register. We must have a system. The Minister of State's proposal in this regard is a knee-jerk reaction and we cannot continue with that system.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">People should not receive social welfare benefit, planning permission, grants or council houses unless they are included in the register. While it would not prevent them getting the benefits, it would delay receiving these benefits until they register. This process should begin with the civics teachers in secondary schools who should tell students that if they are not registered to vote, their social welfare benefits, planning permission, grants and council houses will be delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I am sure Senator Minihan would agree with this proposal, which should be examined. If people are aware when they apply for planning permission that it will be delayed for six or 12 months if they are not on the local register, I have no doubt they would ensure they are registered to vote. As Senator Brady said, there are approximately 90,000 planning applications annually and more than 80,000 houses built each year. I have no doubt these people would ensure they are on the register if these applications were delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">During a recent by-election, Meath County Council deployed temporary polling stations in some of the huge housing estates in Navan, which was a great idea. I would like to know what the turnout was in the housing estates that had the temporary polling stations. While some people did not agree with it initially, it was a great idea because it brought the voting process close to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Senator Minihan is correct to say that the people who compile the register should be automatically made aware when the death of a person occurs. People who die should be deleted automatically from the register. Over the years, people who are deceased have voted and people have arrived at polling stations to find that someone else voted in their place. It would not be a big job if those responsible for the registration of births, deaths and marriages communicated with the local register of electors in the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Members on all sides of the House made good suggestions which should be examined because it is in everyone's interest. The amendment proposes that there will be an early start to the register campaign for 2007-08. As employing enumerators every year will incur significant costs, there should be other ways of dealing with the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">The proposers of the motion are well aware that the measures they are proposing are unrealistic in the short term. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has set out a programme of action which matches the timescale between now and November next when the new draft register is due to be published. The Minister's statement makes it clear that the Government is acting in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I will deal briefly with some of the measures proposed. While consideration is being given to use PPS numbers for voter registration, it is a longer-term measure and could not realistically be achieved before the next election. There are a number of complex and sensitive issues attaching to the proposal. As voter registration in Ireland is not mandatory, there must be a full debate on the issues involved before we can go down the road to compulsory registration.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Establishing an electoral commission has been mooted from time to time. Fine Gael can hardly be saying that a commission could be legislated for, established and made operational this side of an election. Perhaps it is a good idea, but not in the short term. Such a complex matter needs and deserves measured and careful consideration of the issues involved. For example, answers to the general scope and structure of the commission, its functions, whether it would be accountable to the Oireachtas, the Government, the Minister, who would be the members, the staffing arrangements and so on are not included in the Fine Gael motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">There should, of course, be the maximum assurance about the credentials of people presenting themselves to vote. However, the Fine Gael proposal to make mandatory the production of ID cards at polling stations in all cases does not take account of the need for discretion to be used. Requiring identification documents in all cases would cause delay in voting and remove necessary flexibility from the system. For example, there would be no discretion to permit voting to elderly or other persons who may be known to polling staff but failed to bring the identity document. I have seen people being challenged in polling stations. I did not care who they were voting for, but I did not like to see very elderly people who had made a huge effort to get out of the house for perhaps the first time in months to vote being challenged. On one occasion, I saw a fool challenging someone who should have got a prize for turning up to vote. People should use their savvy. It would be dangerous to make voting mandatory because some people get carried away with their own power.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I will refer later to other issues raised in the motion. At this stage, it is clear that the motion misses the point. Setting out diversions in the motion would not effect any improvement between now and next November. What can be done between now and then?</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_254" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_686">The task of compiling the register has become more difficult as a result of the rapid population growth, increased personal mobility, growing numbers of gated apartment complexes and increased rates of new household formation and so on. These are all challenges and many of the difficulties were made known to people during the recent census.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Problems with voting registers are not new. They present challenges in many jurisdictions. A study was carried out last year on electoral systems design published by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. It commented that voter registration is the most complex, controversial and often least successful part of electoral administration. The Government accepts that the quality of the register is not satisfactory and that action is required. It is taking the necessary action, as reflected in the Government amendment now before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, recently announced a package of measures to support local authorities in securing significant improvements in the register. These measures include the provision of updated guidance by the Department so that all local authorities work to the same template, as well as the use of temporary staff, possibly census enumerators, to provide local authorities with additional manpower in preparing the next register. An intensive, door-to-door campaign will be initiated and additional, ring-fenced funding will be provided to local authorities for this purpose. It is also intended to have an early start to the register campaign for 2007-08.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">New arrangements are now in place to delete deceased persons from the register and an intensive information campaign is to be undertaken in tandem with the preparation of the register. Between what the Department is doing and what all the political parties can do, the register will be a much improved document by this time next year. The Department is working with a group of local authority managers and senior officials to help ensure that the above mentioned measures are implemented effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">It is proposed that each household will be visited and provided with forms at least twice. In the event that this process does not register the household, written notification will then be given, cautioning of the danger of the likelihood of household members being omitted from the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">There is wide acceptance of the need for a more rigorous approach to compiling the register to ensure that electoral fraud is avoided. That is the key issue. Whatever about imperfections in the register, the main point is to avoid or remove the opportunity for fraud. There is, at the same time, a need to avoid disenfranchising voters or discouraging the fullest possible voter participation. A balance must be struck and there should be a broad political consensus on these issues. That is why the Minister has taken the initiative by asking the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government to have an early discussion on these issues. I understand that this discussion will take place next week, which should provide a good opportunity for all involved to work together, in a constructive manner, for consensus on issues which are of fundamental importance to the well-being of our democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">In saying that, the point must also be made that while the law places the formal obligation on the local authority to compile the register, it is essential that individual citizens play their full part in ensuring that they are entered correctly on the register. This is a question of personal responsibility. It cannot be argued that the citizen can just stand by and do nothing, leaving it up to the local authority to locate and register him or her. If the concept of citizenship is to mean anything, citizens must check if they are correctly registered to vote and contact their local authority if they are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">My Department has asked all local authorities to ensure that registration information, including current registration forms, is prominent on their websites. An on-line register search facility is now available for people to check if they are on the register. I urge members of all political parties to engage with the electorate on this issue and to be proactive in encouraging everyone to co-operate. The Government is taking action. The local authorities will shortly begin the 2007-08 register campaign but the desired improvements we all seek require significant support from all parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">There is a real difference between the registration and voting processes. While inaccuracies in the register can cause problems and must be addressed, what happens on polling day is what really counts. In that context, the Government has introduced more stringent controls in recent times to counter electoral fraud.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Strong legislation must be mirrored on the ground by vigilance on the part of polling staff and personation agents to ensure that only those eligible are permitted to vote. Standing guidance from the Department calls for one in four voters to be asked for an identity document, up from one in 20 before 2002. Presiding officers, poll clerks and party agents must carry out their vital task diligently and responsibly. They must also do so throughout the day of an election. There is no point in being vigilant only when elderly people are coming in during quiet periods. Identity checking must be done all day long, particularly at busy times, when people are more likely to attempt to engage in fraud.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">All of the measures I have outlined are aimed at ensuring that local authorities make the maximum effort to improve the quality of the register in the period immediately ahead and that the citizen also plays his or her full part. Nobody is doubting that there are problems with the register. They have not arisen overnight and will not be fully solved overnight. A careful and considered approach is necessary. It is not practical to talk about radical change in the registration process over a short period.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">However, with the measures proposed by the Minister, we can get the register into a far better state than is currently the case by November of this year, when the draft register will be published. The Government would not be serving the public interest, or the democratic process itself, by proposing fundamental change without sufficient thought, planning and consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">I call on all parties to support the measures outlined to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register in the short term. The Government is also open to the consideration of longer-term options regarding the electoral registration process on a cross-party basis. That is the way forward and we can also learn lessons from previous debates. For the reasons I have set out, I commend the motion, as amended, to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_699">I wish to share my time with Senator Cummins. I support the motion before the House. As the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has just said it would be ideal if we had cross-party agreement on how the register can be improved and reached a consensus on a reasonable and responsible way to tackle the problem. He has argued that if we are experts on anything, it is on the voting register. However, if we claim to be experts, we should be able to make substantial improvements to it between now and next November, or at the latest, three months later, when the final register is published. In that period of time, we should be capable of doing a good job on the current register.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">With regard to the possibility that 800,000 people are on the register who should not be, it is quite possible that the problem is far more serious in large urban centres than in rural areas. Many people in rural areas will go to the post office, Garda station or local authority office to find out if they are on the electoral register. That has been the custom for many years, although perhaps the younger generation is not so inclined.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Many people have referred to the fact that every citizen has a PPS number, which could be utilised in the compiling of the register. The old system of registration courts, held throughout the country, lent seriousness to the electoral register issue. They were an excellent way of verifying the authenticity of a person who wanted to vote. Unfortunately, they have disappeared. During the months leading up to the compiling of a new register, registration courts were held in various areas. The national and local press advertised the fact that specific areas were designated for such courts, which were held in towns like Loughrea, Portumna, Ballinasloe and so forth. An official presided over the court and people came up with legitimate reasons as to why, for example, a certain individual should be included on the register. The disappearance of the registration courts is regrettable. Perhaps some mechanism could be found for reinstating them. We can tax our cars on-line with a special PIN number from the car registration office in Shannon. I do not see why we cannot register on-line with a local authority which has on-line facilities with our PPS numbers, which can be easily verified. That may eliminate, in the short-term, vast numbers of people denied a vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I agree with the Minister of State that nothing is as revolting as seeing a person with a disability or old age who has made a supreme effort to cast his or her vote, regardless of who it is for, being challenged and turned away. That has happened in the past and caused great concern to elderly people in particular. Young people can walk away and decide it will not happen again. However, an elderly person in certain areas may not have another opportunity. Wider and easier access to a postal vote for elderly people should be examined, or providing another method of voting whereby they can register their vote at a particular time.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Many Senators, including Senator Brady, raised the situation with regard to schools, particularly second-level schools. Through the subjects taught in schools children have access to an element of politics, and work could be done on that. The number of people who reach the age of 18 during their final year in school has increased dramatically. There should be a way in which that information is transferred to the local authority. The information on the number of people who have turned 18 could be transferred in half an hour on a particular day.</p>

          <p eId="para_708">——a transferable vote, precisely. With the greatest respect to the Minister of State and other Dublin city based general election candidates, some people may not necessarily want to vote in Dublin. I am not discussing personalities. They may prefer to vote in their own local areas and we should have a mechanism to allow them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">I agree that many of those measures would and can be incorporated in a long-term policy. In the immediate future there are difficulties. We should seriously consider a mechanism, which would not take a long time to develop, whereby local authorities use on-line registration for voting using a code or PIN for identification to verify a legitimate voter.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">There is a problem in the short term in the proposal of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, regarding organising personnel within a local authority. The use of enumerators or a summer scheme for students can be operated quickly, efficiently and effectively. Many third level institutions have courses in politics and other related subjects. They would be particularly suitable for doing this. I am not sure how practical it is to have a second visit to a house between now and November for the registration of a vote.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_716">The Minister of State mentioned our motion was a knee-jerk reaction to the situation. The motion may be a knee-jerk reaction, but at least it is a reaction. We have seen nothing from the Government during the past nine years. To quote the Taoiseach, it must be a Shank's mare exercise. It should have dawned on the Taoiseach that we should have done this a long time before now. The Taoiseach stated that in the last election a house in his constituency had more than 80 people registered to vote and most of them did. Did the alarm bells not ring with the Taoiseach four years ago that there was a problem with the register of electors? A knee-jerk reaction four years ago could have yielded a better register of electors and the problem we have now may not have existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The chairman of the Association of County and City Councils stated the registers are in a bad state, which we all know, and that any results could be legally challenged. This would make a farce of the democratic system. We suggest that third-level students be used. Much of the work must be done between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. when people are in. It is pointless to do it in the mornings and afternoons when only approximately 10% or 20% of people are at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The issue of e-voting machines is included in our motion. I presume that issue has been put to bed and that we will forget about the system once and for all. It costs in excess of €700,000 on an annual basis to store these machines. I presume that waste of public moneys will be attended to and that we will scrap the system. There is no confidence in it from a public point of view. I would like to discuss a number of other items but I know my time has concluded.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">I am glad to speak during this debate. It was timely that it was put down. It allows us free rein to discuss a cause dear to our hearts. There is no doubt the registers are in an unholy mess. It is a cumulative mess, which continued from the last general election to the local elections to now. It did not arise today or yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">I am sure all of the talk about fraud and personation is a smokescreen. The IRA told us it is done with criminality, which has been attested to. Criminality surely includes personation. I believe the greatest want in this matter is of those who want to vote and are not on the register. That is the greatest wrong done to a citizen. It is all very well to state citizens have a right to register. Local authorities have the mandatory obligation to keep the registers in order and in shape. I am glad to see the Minister will give them special ring-fenced moneys. I hope he announces the amount he will give them soon because local authorities have a degree of scepticism as to whether the money is coming.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I agree with Senator Cummins on the hours during which visits should be made, but I would say between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m rather than 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Those are the three hours in which people are in their homes.

          <p eId="para_735">It is the greatest gap. The rate collectors only go to business premises now. They were the real heroes as they knew when a certain boy or girl was approaching 18 years of age. The names would be put down on the register. There was no disruptive element at that time and it seemed to work reasonably well. When people do not get their vote, they turn on whoever is at the station, arguing that they should be on the register. They should of course be on it, but they are not. Computers are capricious things, as some people may be 14 years on the register and be removed for no reason other than some malfunction within the system. There may be no explanation for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">If people put in their names now on the register, there is no need for the attestation of gardaí, or the affidavit, which comes later. The process is open until the first week in November, when the draft register will issue. Between November and February, there is a period where attestation will be required. From then on, once the register comes out in February and once the election is called, nobody will be included unless a garda has stamped a document indicating that a person lives at a particular address. The process gets progressively more difficult, which I favour. If there is any element of impersonation, it would go on in the latter periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">I commend the amendment and I hope we get working on the matter. There were many fine elements mentioned by Fine Gael. Senator Finucane spoke of good students, bright and intelligent young women and men, who would be very good at going around between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. getting the register in order. We have been talking forever about it and we should on with it.</p>

I am glad to have the opportunity to make some points on the issue, and I will try not to be repetitive, although much has already been said. I am grateful to Fine Gael for airing the matter in their time, as there is much agreement that there is a problem and much needs to be done to rectify it. We would all like this to happen as soon as possible, but that is not realistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I am grateful to the Minister of State for the points that he made, indicating that steps are being taken to have the electoral register as up-to-date as possible, given the timeframe between now and the next general election. Much more needs to be done in order to have the comprehensive system that is required and should be in place for the electoral register. Senator O'Rourke has pointed out that since the abolition of domestic rates, we do not have the rate collecter calling and we did not for many years have the hearings that took place which allowed the register to be up to date. The North of Ireland still has hearings, and I was speaking to Senator Maurice Hayes about it today. It is very helpful there.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">With regard to the bigger picture, a much more comprehensive system must be and can be put in place. This could be done by using students or other means. We need an overall cross-departmental database which interlinks the register of births, marriages and deaths, the electoral register, taxation, passports, licences and others. While I appreciate it would be a very big task which may take a number of years to do properly, if chip and pin technology is used — which we all have with credit and ATM cards — it is possible to aspire to a solution within a period of time. We could have a card which can be used for all State-related business, be it for voting, passport, national identification card or social welfare entitlement purposes, etc. There would be clear benefits for issues such as fighting underage drinking, general identification and the implementation of free travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">We should aspire to this. It should be done through a commission or a national cross-departmental group set up to tackle the matter. Whoever is in Government, be it Fianna Fáil or others, should do this over a period of years. It would solve many problems relating to many different issues. Much needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Senator Ryan mentioned a matter earlier and I resent its implication. He finished with the point that Fianna Fáil had by design kept the register in a way that only older people were voting, and suggested that this would suit Fianna Fáil.</p>

We are moving in a certain direction, so we should accept it. We should find the appropriate and foolproof technology to move forward. Much political football could be played on the issue, but we should rise above it, be realistic and move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">I fundamentally believe that voting in this country should be mandatory. I mentioned on the Order of Business some weeks ago, around the time we were in Arbour Hill paying due tribute. A person could spoil his or her vote, but the act itself should be mandatory.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_752">I thank all the Senators who contributed to this important debate. I saw in the media recently where the Taoiseach stated that he witnessed 80 people voting from a one, three or four-bedroom house. I wonder why he did not take action at that time. The Taoiseach always looks for a way out. He probably slept on it for a few nights and discovered it was a bad dream or a haunted house.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The electoral register is a pivotal element of any democracy, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is charged by the people to maintain it in a proper and correct manner. That is what we are asking for in our motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">It is evident that the Minister has taken his eye off the ball with this issue. It is ongoing, and I referred earlier to Senator Brian Hayes highlighting matters when he wrote to the Minister of the Environment and Local Government after the last local and European elections. He highlighted the issues which we have again highlighted in this motion. The Minister has failed to discharge his duties in this manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">This is the second debacle on our political system in the past two years. We witnessed the e-voting matter and now it is the state of the electoral register. It is the political responsibility for the Minister to deal with the register and ensure its accuracy. It is not an issue where blame can be placed on public servants. I heard the Minister in a radio interview last week where he was attempting to blame local authority officials and public servants in the local authorities. He stated that all local authorities in the country were awash with money.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Minister must realise this is not true. We are all familiar with particular regions and are all aware of local authorities which have been waiting for several years for funding for sewerage or water schemes but have still not received it. The Minister had the cheek to say on a radio show that local authorities were awash with money. Several mayors have contacted me to point out that this was not the case. A special contribution will have to be set aside for the upgrading and correction of the registers.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The electoral register is a fiasco, not just in Dublin, Cork and Galway but in every county. It is up to the Government to amend it to eliminate the hundreds of thousands of errors that exist. It is important that it is checked because if it is not it will distort the election result next year and debase our democratic process.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">University students will be seeking employment when third level colleges close for the summer recess. They would be ideally suited to undertake the work and carry out important remedial works to the register. The Government must not ignore the ability and energy of our young people, which its amendment does by suggesting the re-employment of enumerators who worked on the census. Student schemes operate in every local authority in the country and most can take on approximately 12 students. The exceptions are smaller local authorities which are starved of cash by the Government. The Government should ensure a plan is put in place for students to be taken on because they are ideal and it would introduce them to the political process.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The Minister cannot hide his head in the sand on the issue, which is what he is trying to do. Our proposal for a link between PPS numbers and the electoral register and for employing third level students to make door to door inquiries must be accepted and put into action. As I said earlier today a small percentage of the €50 million squandered on the e-voting system by the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and his colleagues would have financed a complete overhaul of the electoral register.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">There was no mention in the Minister of State's speech of new polling stations to cater for the increased population and to take into account new developments that have taken place at various locations throughout the country. He must take that on board and order them to be opened in the relevant areas. He also quoted the report of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. One would think there were billions of people to cater for. The population of the country stands at only 4 million people, little more than half the population of London, yet the Government still cannot get it right.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">One would also think the Government only came to power last night or last week. It has been in power for the last nine years and the shambles the register is in is a late wake-up call. I plead with the Minister of State to take the Fine Gael proposal on board and abandon the Government amendment. There is very little in it and it constitutes a name and blame game which blames public servants for the situation.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_857">I welcome the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">I recently received correspondence from the chairperson of the board of management of Glenswilly national school, Letterkenny, County Donegal, regarding its attempts to secure an extension to the school building. I hope the Minister is also aware of the representations made by the school's principal because it is an ongoing issue. The principal has written to the Department of Education and Science seeking to change the school's name. The exact name the school has proposed is, "Seeking An Extension Since 1992, Glenswilly National School". It is not facetious but a genuine attempt to highlight the need for extra classrooms. There is nothing underhand about this. The school only wants to highlight the lack of space in the building.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">Glenswilly, the general catchment area for the school, is a satellite area of Letterkenny which has experienced much development in recent years. As a result, more young people are growing up in the area, a similar experience to many other areas. There are 226 pupils at the school and next year it is envisaged there will be 235 pupils. The school-going population has risen but the school building remains the same size.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">On Monday evening, along with my colleague Councillor Noel McBride, I was shown around the school by the principal. The general purpose room is actually used as a staff room to accommodate the teachers on their breaks. The caretaker also uses the room for storing his tools, which raises health and safety concerns. It also prevents proper physical education classes from being held. There is only one toilet to accommodate 18 members of staff. The school has no secretary because there is no space for an office to accommodate one. The extra rooms are necessary to create a proper learning environment. It is not healthy when educational activity is confined into such limited space.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The school buildings are in excellent condition due to the thorough work carried out by its excellent caretaker. The teachers themselves were involved in painting it two years ago. Although it is in excellent condition, its lack of space is the main problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The positive side to this issue is that as more young people live in the area, the more vibrant the community will become. This vibrant community has decided to stand up for itself and believes the time has come for action. The solution must be long term, not short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">I emphasise the importance of the need for more rooms in the school. The Department of Education and Science has identified the need for 12 classrooms. I ask the Minister for Education and Science to directly intervene to expedite the resolution of this situation. I am delighted she attended the Chamber this evening and I look forward to her response.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGerardHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms M. Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_864">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil don Seanadóir as ucht an cheist a ardú. I am familiar with the case of Glenswilly national school since Deputy Keaveney also raised the matter with me. If I were Senator McHugh, I am not sure I would be highlighting the fact the school first applied for its extension in 1992, given that his party was in Government since then. The project did not progress in that period because the school's application was not for extra classrooms but for ancillary accommodation. When money was not as plentiful for the school building programme, priority was not given to ancillary accommodation but to classrooms.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">However, as the Senator stated, enrolment has increased substantially in recent years. There is a staff principal and eight mainstream assistant teachers, two school-based learning support teachers and two resource teachers, a large complement of staff. This has put pressure on schools throughout the country in its own way because since we made so many resource and special needs teachers available, they all now need space. It was as a result of a positive policy decision that there is increased pressure on schools for space and Glenswilly national school is in that position. Having recognised the extra teachers and increased enrolment, it was important that the planning and development unit would look at the numbers in the school at present and, given the rate of development of the area, that it would plan for future enrolment so that capital funding provided now would meet the school's needs into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">That assessment has been completed and the long-term projected staffing figure has also been determined and notified to the school authority, which has agreed it. The next stage is the drawing up of the accommodation brief, which will require a site visit, the next stage in the process. I assure the Senator that will get under way immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">This year we are spending almost €500 million on schools, with at least 1,100 school building projects being undertaken. In playing catch-up, as we are with 4,000 schools, and added teacher investment and increased enrolment, we are trying to spread the money as best we can. The school may say it has been waiting since 1992 but the application it submitted at the time was not for classrooms.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Progress has been made at the Department. Enrolments and staff requirements have been agreed and we will now arrange a site visit and I will then look at the school in the context of the next building programme.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_869">I welcome the Minister's response and appreciate her intervention. I hope the visit to school will be expedited. Irrespective of the timeframe and who was in Government in 1992, I was struck on Monday by the principal telling me he had been seeking improvements for the 33 years he has been in the job. We must examine the situation in the current context.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">I picked up a letter from one of the students when I was in the schools. It reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_871">Dear Minister Hanafin,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_872">My name is Kyle. I am in senior infants in Glenswilly national school. Our school is too small. Please give us an extension.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Kyle will be delighted that his letter was sent directly to the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_874">I also welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for taking this matter. The school in question is St. Catherine's national school, Aughrim, Ballinasloe, County Galway. The school has run into a difficulty causing an additional delay, although the school authorities agree with the Department officials that it is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">St. Catherine's national school was built in 1949 and has had no major refurbishment since. It is a five teacher school with an enrolment of over 120 students. Local research by the board of management and parents clearly indicates that the area is rapidly expanding. The school has three prefabricated buildings, two of which are classrooms and one which provides for special needs students, one of whom in particular is autistic and requires special care. There are several children with special needs and there are two resource teachers, in addition to the five full-time teachers, with another teacher supporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The first application was made by the school in 1996. It was asked to prepare plans in 2000 but it did not hear anything back from the Department despite numerous requests and letters. In March 2005, it was allocated money through the devolved scheme to add two classrooms to replace two of the prefabricated structures. The school prepared plans and secured planning permission. Naturally, however, additional funding was required. The school inspector advised that the school needed a major extension, not what was on offer under the devolved allocation. The authorities met with Department officials and agreed that what was being proposed would not be of any benefit to the school and the Department advised them to withdraw from that scheme and to look for a larger extension with six new classrooms.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">As a result of that the authorities are now back in the Department files as a band 2 application, awaiting further developments in light of proposed housing developments. It was a worthwhile proposal by Department officials and accepted as such by the board of management, principal and parents' council. They do not want, however, to go through the same long process again. Having started in 1996, ten years later they are at band 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I have been asked to request the fast-tracking of the project in view of the overcrowding in both the regular and prefabricated classrooms which is likely to get worse in the next two years. The school authorities want every possible effort to be made by the Department to ensure there will not be a long wait for the people of this historic location.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGerardHanafin" eId="spk_299" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_879">I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising the issue of St. Catherine's national school, Aughrim. It is another area that is experiencing the rapid population growth which is putting pressure on many schools throughout the country to respond to increasing enrolments, the consequent increase in teachers and added pressures as a result of positive policies. Last year 600 resource and support teachers were allocated to deal with children with learning difficulties and special needs. Now, 5,000 of the teaching cohort at primary level are dealing with learning support, which places a space requirement on schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The reduction in class sizes this year and in September places increased pressure on space because every teacher will want a classroom. With the disadvantage programme and smaller classes, there will be an extra 500 primary school teachers in September, all of which causes pressure on space in our schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">We are, however, spending almost €500 million this year to upgrade and modernise schools throughout the country. I understand St. Catherine's wanted to be one of them and progress its interests. The fact it was offered the permanent initiative of €300,000 is a sign the Department recognised it deserved the extra space. This would probably have met its needs at the time of application. However, current demographics and the extra supports gone into the school mean it needs more space than would be possible under the grant given.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The school currently has a principal and four mainstream assistant teachers. It also has a school-based shared learning support teacher and a permanent and temporary resource teacher. Therefore, current requirements already put the school under pressure and enrolment has also increased to 116 from 85.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The Senator pointed out that what the school wants to do and what the Department also requires is to prepare for the requirements not just for 2006 but also for 2007 and 2008. It is important, therefore, to consider enrolment and demographic trends and recent and planned housing developments in the area. This is being done. It is not just a question of saying as there will be "X" number of children, we need "X" number of classrooms, because along with those children there is also a need for extra resource teachers and supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">As soon as the review is completed, we will sign off on the additional facilities needed. The review should not take long, but as it is a growing area, it is important to get it right. In light of the announcements I have made this year, I am anxious to help a school such as St. Catherine's. Once the enrolment demographics are identified, I will be able to look at it. Band 2 is a high priority rating rather than a stage in a process. Band 1 covers amalgamated schools, special needs schools and areas where there are no schools, such as the new developing areas in west and north County Dublin.</p>
