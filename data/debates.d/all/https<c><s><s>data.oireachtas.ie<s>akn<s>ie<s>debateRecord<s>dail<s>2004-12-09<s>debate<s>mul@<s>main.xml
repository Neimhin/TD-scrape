          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_6">This is the third day in a row we have had a proposal for a guillotine. I understand from Deputy Twomey that Committee Stage of the Bill was not satisfactory and there was inadequate time to debate at least 50 amendments. This is fundamental legislation. In the context of my warnings to the Chief Whip in the past two days and because of the importance of the Bill, I oppose the guillotine motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_7">I agree. Two and a half hours is the suggested time to debate a Bill to which there are 151 amendments, most of which come from the Minister and will diminish accountability, which is the issue at the centre of the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_9">The Bill will increase the number of bureaucrats in the service rather than the number at the coalface. However, that is a policy issue. It is unacceptable that such major legislation, for which we have waited 18 months, is brought forward in the dying days of this session and pushed through in an afternoon while amendments are not subjected to scrutiny of any value. This is not the way to do business. I am very surprised the Tánaiste is promoting this approach to enacting legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_10">It was striking as Committee Stage proceeded how many amendments came from the Government. I ask that an Bille Sláinte 2004 be reassessed. Second Stage may have to be rerun before it can proceed to Committee Stage because the Bill has been fundamentally changed. Accountability is being reduced. The Dáil is, effectively, putting itself out of business in regard to accountability for health policy. Will the Tánaiste take account of the reality that the Bill has not been thought through by Government and that it is being changed on the hoof, which is not the way to enact good legislation?</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_11">I oppose the imposition of a guillotine in regard to Report and Final Stages of the Health Bill. This Bill does not represent reform, let alone the radical overhaul the health services require. It tampers with bureaucracy rather than deal with the real problem which is at the coalface of the delivery of health services, most particularly, acute hospital services throughout this jurisdiction. The time offered is inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The number of amendments tabled by Government demonstrates that the presentation of the Bill by it was poorly thought out because a significant change is being made as a result of the amendments now presented. The volume of amendments and what they represent fundamentally alters the proposition first put forward, one which was already flawed and which now further removes democratic accountability in regard to the health services from the accountable elected voices in this State.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_12">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_13">There seems to be much misunderstanding in regard to this matter. Many of the amendments are on foot of the accountability issue which I took on board on Committee Stage and which, I think, Deputies opposite will acknowledge. There was no guillotine on Committee Stage and many of the amendments tabled are as a result of those tabled by Deputies Twomey, McManus and others.</p>

          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_15">It is precisely because we are enhancing the accountability of the new executive that many of the amendments are necessary. After the 1996 Act, which parties opposite brought forward when in office, many of the powers of health board members went to the executive. There was no accountability. This new executive will be accountable to the Dáil, not to the Department of Health and Children. That is a fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">It is important the new administrative management model for the health services, which is all about improving patient care, can come on stream on a statutory basis on 1 January. That is why we are taking the legislation through so rapidly. I apologised before to the House for the speed with which we are taking this Bill. However, there has been no secret about the Government's plan in this area for 18 months.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">Yesterday marked the third occasion on which a carefully choreographed set of circumstances did not lead to a final agreement in respect of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. That is a cause of regret. Credit must be given both to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for the extensive time they have devoted in attempting to resolve this matter in recent years. It is a disappointment to everybody that it has not been possible to conclude it successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Will the Tánaiste confirm that there will be a debate on Northern Ireland next week? The Whips raised the matter and I understand that two hours are to be allocated for the debate. That may not be sufficient time, however, as many Deputies from all parties and none may wish to make contributions.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">In advance of that debate, will the Tánaiste indicate if it is intended to publish the bilateral arrangements between the Government and Sinn Féin, which were not directly related to the matters under discussion yesterday by both Governments and both parties?</p>
          <p eId="para_137">Will there be an attempt by the Government in the coming days to arrange for the DUP and Sinn Féin to sit down together, face to face? Proximity talks brought a great measure of progress on some very sensitive issues but the issue to which the Tánaiste referred yesterday — the modality of decommissioning and its verification — remains the problem. Is it the Government's intention, therefore, to work with the parties and perhaps have them both sit down, face to face, with a view to reaching a conclusion as to how that might be achieved?</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_138">Like Deputy Kenny, I greatly regret that the consistent efforts of both Governments in recent months have failed to revive devolution in Northern Ireland and to arrive at the comprehensive settlement that seemed to be in prospect. Most people on the island will find it incomprehensible that a comprehensive agreement was, or is being put at risk by the demand for a photograph, and that the other side was prepared to put it at risk by the refusal of such a photograph. Before we have the debate next Wednesday, I hope the Government will publish the remaining documents associated with those which some of us could only access early yesterday by downloading them from the Downing Street website. Other documents relating, for example, to the killers of Detective Garda McCabe, to the issue of the right of audience in the Oireachtas for elected representatives in Northern Ireland, and to any other bilateral side agreements the details of which have not been contained in the papers, should be made available to the Opposition before the discussion on Wednesday next.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_139">The Green party is gravely disappointed but not entirely surprised that there has been a stalling in the process. We assume it is only a stalling. Will the Tánaiste indicate the Government's assessment of where lies the particular challenge at this time? The Tánaiste mentioned that it was not merely a question of a photograph but the Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed to narrow it down specifically to that issue. In the interests of informing the House and allowing us to see some light at the end of the tunnel, can the Government give some clarity to this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_140">In advance of the debate, it would be useful if the Government might indicate its assessment as to what items under discussion are effectively outside the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. These may include such issues as the fate of the killers of Detective Garda McCabe or the demand for a photograph. There is a clear idea that the Good Friday Agreement is being stretched on both sides and that items are being brought to the table from outside. Wherein lies the current difficulty? There seems to be a difference of opinion between Government spokespersons, including the Tánaiste, as to what the issue is. This should be clarified before next week's debate, which we welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">I wish to record my disappointment and that of my colleagues at the failure so far to achieve the goal of a full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, a goal to which our party is absolutely committed. I join other voices in the House in commending the efforts of both Governments and of the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I also strongly commend the courageous efforts of the Sinn Féin leadership and negotiating team who have demonstrated an absolute commitment to the address of all the difficulties that have bedevilled this island and the neighbouring island and our relationship for generations. They have shown themselves to be courageous leaders. I wish also to commend the leadership of the Irish Republican Army which has clearly demonstrated its preparedness to take historic and unprecedented steps.</p>

        <heading>Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments Bill 2004 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</heading>
        <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_55">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_176">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_177">On 17 November, I gave notice during the debate in this House on the amendment of the terms of reference of the planning tribunal that I intended to bring a short Bill before the Oireachtas. The Bill will give legal backing to the discretion granted in the amended terms of reference to the tribunal to decide which issues within its terms of reference to investigate. The Attorney General advised me that it would be important to underpin this new discretion with legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">On 3 December, I made the instrument giving effect to the amended terms of reference as passed by this House and the Seanad. Under paragraph J(7) of the amended terms of reference, the final date for receipt of any new complaint or request for investigation is fixed by the terms of reference as 16 December of this year. The exercise of the discretion by the tribunal on any new matters that come to its attention before 16 December is vital to the running of the tribunal. I was advised that otherwise an argument could be made that the exercise of the discretion may be considered to have been outside its powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The background to the tribunal is well known to the House but I will recap a number of points. On 17 November, I indicated the basis on which this legislation was arising. It has its foundation in the fourth interim report. Notwithstanding the fact that the tribunal was expanded to include three members in 2001, the work of the tribunal, based on its terms of reference, has proved to be very unwieldy. As a result, the tribunal itself in its fourth interim report issued on 15 June of this year requested a change to its terms of reference to allow it more discretion in the issues that it investigates, with a view to shortening the anticipated duration of the tribunal's activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">In the report, the tribunal indicated that it still has a large volume of work on hand which, if its mandate played out to its full extent, would all have to be investigated. The tribunal therefore indicated that it could see the work carrying on until 2014 or 2015. The tribunal itself recognised that this situation could not and should not continue. So it sought discretion to decide what matters it should investigate. In addition, if the tribunal decided the continued pursuit of its inquiries were of limited or of no further value in discharging its mandate, it sought the power to report that to the Oireachtas and to convey to the Oireachtas the wish of the tribunal that its investigations and inquiries should terminate on a date to be specified by the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Following the publication of the report, the Government mandated the Attorney General to consult the tribunal on changes to its terms of reference, as provided for under the 1998 tribunals legislation. There were a number of queries as to why the Attorney General was the intermediary here. The answer to those is that it is a provision of the Act. The changes, to which the tribunal then consented, go further than those originally requested in the interim report. Both Houses of the Oireachtas agreed the amended terms of reference on 17 November this year, and we had a good debate on this topic on that date. The tribunal has indicated that the amended terms of reference together with the additional resources given will allow the tribunal to complete its public hearings by March 2007, a substantially shorter time frame than that indicated in the tribunal's fourth interim report.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Since we have already debated the changes made in the new paragraph J which was added to the terms of reference, I will not repeat the detail. Suffice it to say that paragraph J enables the tribunal to complete its current investigations into planning issues in Dublin, including the Carrickmines and Quarryvale modules and interlinked matters. The tribunal must have received any new complaint or request for investigation by 16 December of this year. As this tribunal has been operating since 1997, I do not think this is an unreasonable time limit. Persons who wished to bring matters to the attention of the tribunal have had adequate time and opportunity to do so. They still have up until 16 December to make further submissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">By 1 May 2005, the tribunal must decide what new matters on its books will proceed to a public hearing. To allow the tribunal to prepare its final report no new investigation can be referred to public hearing by the tribunal, other than matters that come to light during existing investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The discretion being granted to the tribunal, and which is the subject of this legislation, is in Paragraph J(6) of the terms of reference. It will allow the tribunal: to decide to carry out any preliminary investigations as it thinks fit, in private, using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts, in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any matter before it to warrant proceeding to a public hearing if deemed necessary; to decide not to initiate a preliminary investigation or a public hearing of evidence in relation to the matter notwithstanding that the matter falls within the tribunal's terms of reference, or; in any case where it has initiated a preliminary investigation in private, whether concluded or not, but not yet initiated a public hearing of evidence in the matter, to decide to discontinue or otherwise terminate its investigation notwithstanding that the matter falls within the tribunal's terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">In exercising this discretion the tribunal must have regard to the following: The age or state of health of one or more persons who are likely to be in a position to provide useful information, including oral evidence to be given privately or publicly. This would include the age or likely state of health of any such person, at the possible date in the future when that person or persons might be expected to be called upon to give oral evidence, or otherwise to co-operate with the tribunal. In particular, the tribunal may consider whether or not their age or state of health would to be an impediment to such person being in a position to co-operate with the tribunal or to give evidence to the tribunal in private or in public; the likely duration of the preliminary investigation or public hearing into any matter; the likely cost, or other use of the resources of the tribunal, of such investigation or any stage of the investigation into any matter; whether or not the investigation into the matter is likely to provide evidence to the tribunal which would enable it to make findings of fact and conclusions or to make recommendations and; any other factors which in the opinion of the tribunal would, or would be likely to, render the continued investigation into any matter inappropriate, unnecessary, wasteful of resources, unduly costly, unduly prolonged or of limited or no probative value.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">During the debate on the tribunal's amended terms of reference, the issue was raised of using more positive language in relation to the discretion. However, the language used is that requested by the tribunal itself. The 1998 Tribunals Act requires that any amendment to the terms of reference must have the consent of the tribunal. I therefore pointed out at the time that my hands were tied on this matter. In any case the tribunal and the Government is happy that the language in the terms of reference will allow the tribunal to exercise its discretion flexibly and effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">In the course of the debate in the Houses on the amendment of the terms of reference in November of this year, questions were raised on how future allegations of corruption would be investigated. I think everyone here agrees that the workings of the existing tribunal have become too unwieldy. That is why we are here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The Government has in recent years, made a number of changes, first to make it harder to commit acts of corruption and go undiscovered, and second, to ensure that issues of public concern can be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for example, have introduced a new level of transparency into the planning process, in particular into the process of adopting development plans and imposing development contributions. The Local Government Act 2001 has extended provisions on declarations of interest and codes of conduct to all members and more senior staff of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Under the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 corruption is presumed where there is proof that certain persons in public office have received money or other benefits from a person who has an interest in the outcome of certain decisions, including planning decisions. This will make the prosecution of corrupt payments easier because it will be up to the individual to show that there was no corrupt purpose to taking the payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Other measures introduced by Government, which will assist in the prevention of corruption, include the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995. This Act requires office holders, members of the Oireachtas, the Attorney General, ministerial advisers and persons holding positions in a wide range of public bodies including the civil service to make a public disclosure of interests. The Standards in Public Office Act, 2001 established a commission with wide investigative powers. It is a permanent statutory body set up to monitor, investigate and regulate the conduct of those elected to serve the Irish people or employed in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">As for the future of investigations on issues of public concern, the legislation brought forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and enacted as the Commissions of Investigation Act, 2004 in July this year allows for commissions of investigation to be established. It is envisaged that these commissions will conduct their inquiries in a less confrontational manner and will be more cost effective than tribunals of inquiry have proven to be. We all know the costs involved and the length of time taken to come to conclusions have been a cause of public disquiet and concern. In fact, Members of this House specifically referred to this during the course of the debate in November. Among other things, the legislation addresses a point that I know to be of concern to members of the Opposition, as well as to the Government. That is, to ensure that the legal costs of these investigations do not go out of control. Speaker after speaker made this point in both Houses in November.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The Commissions of Investigation Act provides that a competitive tendering process may be used in selecting persons to work with the commission, including barristers and solicitors. In addition, when a commission is being established the full costs of the commission will have to be estimated. The chairperson of the commission will have to seek authority from the appropriate Minister if the estimate is to be exceeded. It is also open to the Oireachtas to establish a new tribunal at any date in the future. The option is always available if the circumstances require it. It is important to put that on the record again. While I know Members of this House have no confusion in their minds, some public confusion exists and some people believe we are doing away with tribunals. This is not the case. If the Houses of the Oireachtas in their wisdom feel the circumstances require a tribunal, it can still happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce legislation shortly to address the issue of legal costs of tribunals, in particular the third party legal costs. This matter was also raised by Opposition spokespersons. This will give this House an opportunity to debate the issue more thoroughly. The Law Reform Commission will also publish its final report on tribunals shortly. I am sure that the report will contain many useful recommendations on how tribunals should operate in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Notwithstanding these many important changes, the Government is not complacent. When it was established, the tribunal was tasked with making recommendations "as to the effectiveness and improvement of existing legislation governing corruption in the light of its inquiries". To date the tribunal has not recommended further action on legislative change. However, should such recommendations be made, the Government will give them full and early consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The House will be aware that the planning tribunal has been given additional legal resources to allow it to complete its work within the time limit that it set. I know there is some disquiet in the House on the matter. However, this is in line with the Government's commitment to ensuring that the work of the tribunal will be completed fully and properly. When allied with the changes to the tribunal's terms of reference, the additional staff will result in a substantial reduction in the projected life of the tribunal and, as a result, an overall reduction in its final cost to the Exchequer, which is the point made in the fourth report.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">The proposed legislation will underpin the tribunal's exercise of its discretion as to which matters it will investigate or bring to public hearing. This will help the tribunal to complete its mandate in a timelier way and within a more certain framework. The changes in its terms of reference and this legislation will allow the tribunal reach findings and make recommendations to help ensure that the events it has investigated cannot occur again. It is important that we learn from the past. The combined wisdom of the Houses of the Oireachtas is evident in the infrastructure we have established in recent years to address the pernicious issue of corruption. In particular, I thank the spokespersons of the main Opposition parties who were very open to discussion with me on this matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_200">While I understand the many pressures on the House, in ways it is a pity that this debate is so short. Given the millions of euro that have been spent on the tribunals, I would like to have seen more time and more contributions from all sides of the House. I join the Minister in paying tribute to the work of the tribunals and particularly to Mr. Justice Flood, Judge Mahon and their hard working team, who have been dealing with this sore in society for many years. An appalling vista of corruption has been exposed by the tribunals. Those in public life, who were given the sacred trust of the people when first elected betrayed that trust and have been exposed at the tribunals. In time I hope they will face the rigours of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">We need to consider what should be in place now that it has been decided that the tribunal will finish only the investigations based on complaints reported to it to date and complaints that will be reported to it before the deadline the Minister has outlined. As the tribunal completes its work, insufficient ideas are coming from Government as to how to address such problems in the future. As the Minister said, the tribunal was asked to make recommendations on changes in the planning laws. From media reports of the tribunal, everybody is clear and I am sure the tribunal itself is also clear as to what recommendations it could make.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">We tabled an amendment recommending that the tribunal would, by 1 July 2005, make proposals on changes to the planning laws. This is not an unreasonable request and I ask the Minister to consider it. While the amendment has been ruled out of order on a technicality, we should ask the tribunal to expedite this matter as it will help in preventing future corruption. The views of the tribunal on this matter will be very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">During the previous local election campaign, Fine Gael proposed a rezoning board. When councils make changes to their development plans, particularly those rezoning large tracts of land, such decisions should be referred to a national rezoning board. This view was echoed to a certain extent in the manifesto of the Progressive Democrats, which I read recently. That party seems to feel as well that we need another national forum to which rezoning decisions could be referred. As the Minister and I know in our own counties, these decisions can be controversial issues. Having another layer to which rezoning issues could be referred for examination would be a positive development. It would allow other points of view to be expressed and perhaps the public interest could be considered in a more significant way than is sometimes the case with local authority meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The local authority strategic policy committees may be able to play an important role in the area of planning and rezoning. When a particular plot of land is proposed for rezoning or a development plan is introduced, the strategic policy committee should meet and invite all the interested parties, members of the public, landowners, potential developers and everybody that could possibly have an interest and a view on the rezoning issue. In a public, open and transparent way, all players should attend the meeting and express their views fully and openly. In that way we would have total transparency about the representations, views and arguments. This would give everybody an opportunity to contribute to a public forum, which does not exist now.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Today representations are made directly to councillors in their homes, which can put extreme pressure on them. As I said in a previous debate, some councillors in County Louth have referred to the process being like spaghetti junction outside their homes, with a succession of planners and landowners impressing their views as to how the development plan should change at the following meeting. A more transparent and open system with such representations happening in a structured and formal way would lend strength to the valid arguments and point up the weak ones. Most importantly, the process would be transparent and open. This is a solid idea worthy of consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">To address the issue of lawyers' fees, it is now accepted that we need a tendering process for lawyers contracted to work for the State. We should advertise for the additional lawyers required by the tribunal and applicants should be required to outline what they believe their fees ought to be. This would increase effectiveness and save money.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">I note the Minister's comments on the commissions of investigation, on which we have no difficulty. We should consider the role of the Standards in Public Office Commission. Politicians and office holders make their statutory declarations to that body. The tribunal and the Law Reform Commission will have recommendations and we will have our own views. As the Minister usefully suggested yesterday, these issues could be teased out at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government to get the best views possible. We can then work this out to everyone's satisfaction. It is important that we get planning right, end corruption, have greater transparency and work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I welcome this legislation. It initiates a new process where we can put everyone's best ideas forward. We know about probity in public life and the commitment displayed by the vast majority of public representatives and officials but it is those who have been before the tribunals and who have been corrupt who give us all a bad name. It is incumbent on us to put the most open regime possible in place to deny access to the corrupt.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_59">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_209">This Bill is before us because the Oireachtas approved a motion to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal on 17 November. The tribunal sought these changes to allow it to complete its work within a reasonable timeframe. It will now be able to exercise its discretion not to investigate matters that it believes will not bring tangible results. Time has been lost at the tribunal by going over evidence for days and the public has lost all confidence in its reaching a worthwhile conclusion. After seven years, people see that no one has gone to jail on criminal charges, despite serious planning irregularities coming to light ten years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Many highly paid lawyers and others are employed on a full-time basis in the tribunal; their jobs are more secure than ours, we must offer ourselves for election every five years. It may not be in the interests of those people to come to a definitive conclusion. The tribunal goes over the same ground, asking the same question in different ways, and spends days dealing with the one problem. If what we are doing today allows for discretion not to investigate matters that will not bring tangible results, it will be a good thing and we will not oppose the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">This problem would not have arisen if questions had been answered correctly and thoroughly in the Dáil and not just with the minimum information. Much of the fault rests with us. We have been in opposition for the duration of the tribunal and if some of our questions about planning matters had been answered properly, there would be no need for some of the work in the tribunal. The tribunal has cost millions of euro but the responsibility for that rests with those who prepare answers for Ministers that do not give full details in response to pertinent questions. The lack of a proper response led to the establishment of the tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Local elections can interrupt the discussion of a county or city development plan, as happened in Galway City Council this year, where we had spent a year and a half dealing with the city development plan before the elections and we were ready to publish the draft plan. At election time, however, at least four members could not stand for election and four more lost their seats or retired. As a result, almost half of the councillors dealing with the final stages of the development plan were new and did not have a clue. Experience is needed to deal with a local development plan. When a local election interrupts the consideration of a development plan, it makes the contributions of councillors null and void. Mistakes are then made because the councillors do not know exactly what is happening. The Minister should introduce legislation to ensure local elections do not interfere with development plans. If the plans coincide with elections in five years' time, the plans should either be postponed for a year or brought forward by a year so they can be dealt with by the council that begins and ends the process. That would decrease the pressure on councillors in the serious and legitimate work they do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_60">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_213">The substantive issue underlying this Bill was debated in the House when we discussed the motion to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal. I will not repeat what I said on that occasion. It would be helpful, however, if the Minister set out where the area of doubt lies in the changes of the terms of reference that requires the support of a one-line Bill that gives the tribunal the authority in primary legislation to exercise the discretion with which it has been provided. There were a number of issues to which I referred during the course of the debate on the amendments to the terms of reference to which I refer again, not least because the Minister drew attention to them in his opening contribution. The first relates to the issue of legal fees. As I understand it, the proposal is that the new method of payment of lawyers at the tribunal will not take effect until after March 2007, the date by which the tribunal expects to have completed its public hearings. Two issues arise from that. First, I am surprised at the confidence the Minister has expressed on behalf of the tribunal that it will have completed its public hearings by March 2007. The experience to date has been that once the tribunal gets into public hearings it cannot know in advance what issues may be spawned by those public hearings which may give rise to either a continuation of the public hearings or to other issues which may of necessity have to be examined in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I question whether the public hearings will be concluded by March 2007. If issues are still outstanding by March 2007, perhaps aspects of modules that have not been completed, will we be faced with a situation in March 2007 where the Minister will come back here to say the new schedule of fees will not apply in March 2007 and that the date may have to be extended?</p>
          <p eId="para_215">That gives rise to the second question which is why the new schedule of fees cannot be implemented from a current date or from a date with a reasonable period of notice. The new schedule of fees provides for very generous public service salaries to be paid to lawyers working in the tribunals. Allowing for a phase-out period of the present arrangements I see no reason the new schedule of fees cannot be implemented from a current date.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The second issue with which I am concerned is the exclusion of material that may arise after 16 December. Given that the tribunal has been in existence in 1997, it is well known that any planning issue that somebody wants to investigate has already been submitted to the tribunal or may be submitted by 16 December. If, for example, some issue comes to public attention after 16 December, it is unreasonable that the tribunal is, in effect, prevented from investigating that material. Some way may have to be found to allow for the admission of material which arises after 16 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Third, the tribunal may exercise its discretion under paragraph J(6) of the terms of reference. I expressed concern when debating the motion that those conditions are a list of reasons the tribunal may not pursue certain investigations or reasons the tribunal may drop certain matters and that that needed to be counterbalanced by a provision which would give the tribunal the right to decide positively that it should pursue an investigation of certain matters. The Minister referred to this in his contribution when he said that the issue of more positive language is used in regard to the discretion. He made the point that these terms of reference came from the tribunal and that his hands were tied. Perhaps he will clarify the following sentence: "In any case the tribunal and Government is happy that the language in the terms of reference will allow it to exercise its discretion flexibly and effectively." Do I understand correctly from that sentence that since the debate on the terms of reference the tribunal has been consulted again, specifically about the amendment I proposed on that occasion, which would have given a more positive expression of the circumstances in which the tribunal could exercise its discretion, and, if so, perhaps we will hear the outcome?</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Essentially the Bill is about giving a legal basis for the tribunal to exercise its discretion. We have to look back on it and acknowledge that some concerns were expressed in 1997 about the wide nature of the terms of reference of the original Flood tribunal. The difficulty with giving a tribunal wide terms of reference is that if the tribunal has referred to it a large number of issues it inevitably becomes bogged down and focus may be lost in respect of particular matters. It should have been recognised in 1997 that danger existed with the planning tribunal because we already had the experience of what happened with the beef tribunal. One of the criticisms of the beef tribunal, its report and its inability to reach decisive conclusions was that its original terms of reference were too wide. In effect, the beef tribunal was given the task of investigating everything and anything about the beef industry and, to some extent, the same has happened with the planning tribunal. It was given terms of reference to investigate everything and anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Often when a tribunal is asked to investigate everything and anything it finds it difficult to come to grips with specific matters. We now have a situation where because of the volume of material being dealt with, the tribunal has asked for a mechanism whereby it may be able to exercise its discretion as to what matters it should examine in private, what matters should go into public investigations and what issues might be left aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">It is not for this House to second-guess how the tribunal might exercise that discretion. The tribunal has the information available to it on which it can exercise that discretion. There are a number of areas where we are entitled to suggest an approach. Obviously the tribunal will exercise discretion as to which matters should or should not be pursued but it would appear also from the terms of reference that it would have discretion as to how it pursues certain matters, whether in private by way of private investigation or by way of public examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">From looking at the practice of the tribunal in recent years it appears there are areas where time could be saved. The business of bringing in planning officials at the beginning of a module to spend days describing how planning decisions are made, delineating pieces of land, showing maps and putting on the record matters which are simply matters of fact and are not in contention, should be capable of being done in private or by way of affidavit. Similarly, where there is evidence of a factual nature, that is, where there is no dispute about the evidence, where one party says one thing and the other agrees, it should be possible to have those matters recorded by way of affidavit or some mechanism rather than spend days in public hearings putting on record matters not in dispute, and the kind of adversarial cross-examination approach we have seen in the tribunal should not arise because they are not in dispute. Such matters would become part of the tribunal's report over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that we need to pay attention to the changes to planning laws which are required. I do not accept the Minister's implication that everything has been fine in the planning process since the Planning and Development Act 2000 was passed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_224">There have been significant improvements in respect of the disclosure of information and the declaration of interests. If the entire process that is now in place for elected representatives and appointed public officials had been in place in the 1970s and 1980s, some of the issues which have been investigated by tribunals would not have arisen. Such problems certainly would not have developed in the way they did.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Further changes need to be made to planning legislation, however. I refer, for example, to the development plan process. Deputy McCormack said that when a local election is called, the clock does not stop ticking on the time limits which are imposed during certain phases of the development plan process. That can lead to the type of circus that occurred in County Wicklow, for example. When Wicklow County Council met after the local elections, councillors had to address a glut of issues within a short period of time because there was a midnight deadline. Some of the changes to planning legislation which are needed are contained in a Private Members' Bill that I recently published. I ask the Minister to examine the Bill seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Perhaps the joint committee is the most appropriate place in which to address the new dynamic in the planning process. The driving of planning is different now from what it was in the 1980s as a result of the introduction of new residential planning guidelines, for example relating to density. The development of the construction industry and changes in the residential property market have contributed to a change in the dynamic of the planning process. The effects of such changes need to be re-examined and, if necessary, addressed in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The tribunal has been established as a result of corruption, which is the core issue being debated by the House. All Members are aware that money is the root of all evil. Corruption in the planning process is driven by the inordinate profits which can be made by speculating in development land. Such speculation has corrupted the planning process and ensured that home ownership is beyond the reach of working families.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I am disappointed that the report of the all-party committee on the price of building and development land, which was published last April, has not been debated in the House. It does not matter that we have established tribunals, passed legislation and put ethics procedures in place because the temptation to engage in corruption will remain until we remove the element of speculation, which can lead to enormous windfall profits, from dealings in building and development land.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">The Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments Bill 2004 is a necessary step in the convoluted process of dealing with the inquiry into past problems in the planning sector. Rather than climbing every tree, it is important that we should climb the right trees. We should find the needle instead of examining every piece of hay in the haystack. As Deputy Gilmore pointed out, we need to cut to the chase by dealing with these matters in a more time-effective and cost-effective manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I feel a slight sense of unease because issues which are now emerging may need to be dealt with by another tribunal at a later date. My unease is exacerbated because the factors which led to the original establishment of the tribunals remain in place. The stakes have got much higher in the intervening ten years, if anything. It is not all sweetness and light because the interests of landowners, auctioneers and councillors continue to collide in a dangerous way when the wholesale rezoning of land takes place. We need to grasp the nettle by finding a better way of making decisions. The discussion on the County Wicklow development plan in recent months epitomises the amateur fashion in which decisions are being made. Councillors were deceived when they were given information that indicated that industries would leave the area if certain options were not taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">We need to establish a body to review development plans at a draft stage. With all due respect to the Minister, Deputy Roche, I do not think he is the appropriate person to review development plans to ensure that they comply with national strategies, such as the sustainable development strategy. We need a separate body to engage in such reviews. It would not be appropriate for An Bord Pleanála to be involved in such matters, given that individual planning applications can be appealed to it. We need a stand-alone quasi-judicial body that can sign off on development plans, in effect, and state whether they are sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">As Deputy Gilmore pointed out, we need to consider the recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. That there can be a massive increase in the value of land at the stroke of a pen needs to be addressed. The committee's recommendation that local authorities should be allowed to purchase land at the existing use value, plus 25%, is a good one. I feel a real sense of anger when I read property supplements which state that €40 million has been added to the price of a few fields in Shankill, €100 million has been added to the price of land in west Dublin and a site on Leopardstown has suddenly brought in a profit of an additional €40 million. While the chosen golden circle is reaping enormous profits, the ordinary people of Ireland who wish to put down roots in an area, for example by purchasing a home close to their parents, are denied the opportunity to do so. They are being pushed to the periphery of Dublin or to other counties because they cannot afford to buy land or housing in the neighbourhoods in which they grew up. That is fundamentally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">There is a huge onus on the Minister to rectify the dangerous problems which are inherent in our planning legislation. Until he does so, I do not think we can be said to have dealt with the root problem of widespread corruption in the planning process. Those who facilitate property speculators have not gone away. Some of those who deliberately made appalling decisions in the past were re-elected earlier this year. We will have further tribunals in ten years' time if we do not tackle the root cause of planning corruption in Ireland. I feel a palpable sense of anger because that core issue has not been addressed. We need to wed the review of the development planning process and the election of councillors. The development plan is reviewed every six years and the election of councillors every five years. During my 11 years as a councillor, incredible problems arose because councillors had to pick up the pieces of half-finished development plans before, during or after elections. Councillors should stand for election on the basis of a development plan with which they have dealt from start to finish. The Minister should ensure that the development plan review process and the local authority elections coincide such that there will be a sense of closure regarding the preparation of such plans. I acknowledge the work Deputy Gilmore and his party have put into considering these issues.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_66">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_236">This is one of those very frustrating Bills that we must consider every now and again. It is frustrating because there are so many things it could do but does not do, yet we are in favour of it because of its one good element, that is, it offers some kind of finish to the Mahon tribunal. One will recall that the report of the tribunal stated the tribunal could continue until 2014 or 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">In light of the one good element in the Bill, will the Minister address the question of how the tribunal can tell us reasonably that it is likely to conclude all its business by 2007? The tribunal has indicated that the amended terms of reference, together with additional resources — it was acknowledged that additional resources would help — will allow it to complete its public hearings by March 2007. I question the accuracy of this statement considering that there are still some days to go before the door is closed on people bringing matters to the attention of the tribunal. Perhaps the matter could be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">It is important to acknowledge that the Mahon tribunal in particular has played a vital role in exposing the corruption that has been endemic in the State over many years. It brought the issue of corruption to the public domain and shed light on how certain individuals, such as Ray Burke and George Redmond, actually operated. It created a climate in which corruption is no longer acceptable. Nevertheless, the tribunal system is extremely cumbersome and obviously very expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The Mahon tribunal is making some very slow progress. It is sometimes slow because of the non-co-operation of certain witnesses. Many in the public domain would like to see the tribunal take a tougher stance on such witnesses. It is frustrating that very few prosecutions have resulted from the tribunal's work. The legal profession has been unashamedly exploiting the tribunal process as a cash cow for many years. The public feels the legal professionals are like parasites bleeding the taxpayer and it is outraged and annoyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">This Bill did not deal with all the elements with which it should have dealt. It should have dealt with the issue of legal fees and implemented a ceiling pertaining thereto. It is proposed that senior counsel are to receive an annual salary of €213,000 plus, solicitors are to receive an annual salary of €176,000 and junior counsel are to receive an annual salary of €142,000. These figures are bizarre. I imagine that even these high salaries could be lower than those the recipients' are currently earning.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I agree with the points made on the terms of reference. The terms of reference of the Mahon tribunal are manifestly too broad for it to deliver on the objectives for which it was established. It is clear that the terms of reference need to be made more specific and achievable. They should be set within a specific time frame if the tribunal is to be effective in exposing corruption and wrongdoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">We need to ensure that the chairman of the tribunal does not have too much discretion in deciding what to investigate. Would it have been better to refer this decision-making process to an Oireachtas Committee? Such a committee could play a major role in ensuring that the discretion of the chairman is not too wide. I hope these issues can be reconsidered because it is clear that this bandwagon of a tribunal system will proceed for some considerable time.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_243">This Bill could be passed automatically, if that were possible. The matters it addresses were well and truly debated during a motion in the House a few weeks ago. Given the public fatigue regarding tribunals in general, the quicker we deal with this Bill and put the amended terms of reference in place to allow the tribunal to proceed at a speedier rate, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">That the fourth report of the tribunal states the completion date of the tribunal could be as late as 2014 brought home to the public the open-ended nature of the investigation. There is no need for a tribunal of any nature to sit for so long. There is no doubt that one reason for the Mahon tribunal's longevity was the obligation to investigate everything that moved, irrespective of its importance or relevance.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">It is partly the fault of this House that the tribunal is so long-winded. The House failed to bring proper, reasoned, definitive thinking to bear on the original terms of reference when putting them in place. That a provision to limit the discretion of the tribunal regarding what it could investigate was not originally included in the terms of reference defies logic and smacks of amateurism.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I referred to public fatigue regarding tribunals. The public has partly switched off and there is no doubt that the minute detail and seemingly irrelevant direction sometimes pursued by the Mahon tribunal are responsible for this. The tribunal should operate in a manner to which the public can relate, and it should be possible to follow and note the relevance of the proceedings. However, the looseness of the terms of reference makes this impossible.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">When the tribunal was being set up, sensible arguments were met with cries of rigging and accusations of attempts to muzzle the tribunal in its work. If the intention of any action is to make the tribunal more efficient, it deserves a better reception. If there had been a better reception, we might have avoided the mess in which we are now. Everybody associated with tribunals in the future should learn this lesson.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I support the Bill because it attempts to bring sanity to the workings of the tribunal. It is tailored to impose a reasonable time scale on its proceedings. The work of the tribunal is vital to expose the dirty dealings that took place and, I hope, prevent such corruption in the future.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_249">I understand the Government's frustration over the cost of the tribunal. It is time that the public saw what is taking place at the proceedings. I have a proposal in this regard and I will ask the spokesperson for Fine Gael on this issue to table an amendment on Committee Stage to address the matter. The proposal is that the national broadcaster, RTE, should be instructed to televise the proceedings of the tribunal daily so the public can see what is happening and know for what the taxpayers are providing money. I hope the Government will take this on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">It should be televised. I listen to it regularly on "Tonight with Vincent Browne". It may be great fun for certain people who are tied up in the planning process and stand accused to represent themselves but it costs the tax payers a fortune. The people are sick and tired of it and would like to see it finished. They would like to see those who created this problem behind bars. That will not happen because there is only one law and that is for the poor, there is none for the rich. A recent bank report showed that this State and the Revenue Commissioners crucified the unfortunate people who had offshore accounts while those who committed the crimes are still in their big jobs in AIB and drawing large salaries. They will never be prosecuted.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">If one is a certain age and does not feel well one does not have to attend the tribunals but one can go on holidays, go sailing, have a good time and laugh at us all. Maybe it is time to forget about the tribunals, call them off, prosecute those we know were involved in planning corruption and put them behind bars. Let that be the lesson for the future. What is the point in wasting our money and the taxpayers' money when the only result will be more reports from judges to be put in the library? Meanwhile all the boys, the women and the builders will continue to campaign and will be in the tent at next year's races in Galway, and they will not have changed. They will proudly run into the tent and put their cheques on the table. They will not care. There is no point in having tribunals, spending taxpayers' money on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I was a member of a local authority for 25 years and thank goodness we did not have a problem with rezoning. Our problem was that we could not get anyone to build on the land, we could not get funding from the State to install sewerage and water schemes so we had no corruption. Maybe if we had, some of our members might be in the same position as those in the tribunal. One problem we did have, which I saw in the recent national development plan, was that the State and its officials came to the council to present documents on what they wanted rezoned. When we councillors wanted to get independent advice and bring in professionals to advise us we were told we could do that but at our own cost. That is wrong and should be examined. If councillors represent the people they should get independent professional advice rather than let the State with its full resources bring in plans when councillors do not know whether they are right or wrong. I agree with the previous speakers that something must be done about development plans carrying on from council to council. People will have to stand over the county development plan they adopt and present it to the people to decide if it is right.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">I understand and support the Minister's desire to wrap up these tribunals as soon as possible because the people are sick and tired of the new super-rich, namely, barristers. I am only sorry that I did not stay longer in school because if I was a barrister now I would be in the Four Courts every day and if I could make half the money these people make——</p>

          <p eId="para_267">One can hear varying degrees of expertise on planning according to who is speaking. An expert in the area is probably somebody who can define good planning. I would like to know that definition because I have been involved in planning for a long time too. I have been involved in the review of at least three development plans in my constituency and I never realised I was so ignorant of the fundamentals of good planning until so-called experts arrived and told me where I was wrong. I never accepted intimidation from developers or groups of any description. I felt it was my right, and my statutory duty, to make up my mind on what was right or wrong and to stand over it afterwards, in a democracy, with the full force and support of a democracy behind me.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">That has changed. It is not uncommon even in this city and its environs to see an advertisement bearing the slogan "no development here" adjacent to it. Is that the ultimate in good planning? It is intended to be but like Pontius Pilate, it only calls on the multitudes to come out in support of the views of that group or person, essentially to exclude other people from their vision, send them elsewhere, far from their horizon. Until that attitude is tackled, particularly in this city, there will always be problems because there will always be people who attempt to circumnavigate the rules and try to do things that are totally illegal to combat them.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The population of Dublin is dropping. Why is that happening throughout its constituencies while the population in all other parts of the country is growing? It is because people are being forced out of the city to live in the country but they must drive back into the city to work. They spend two hours on the road every morning and evening, cluttering up all the routes built to alleviate traffic congestion. That is a fact that needs to be seriously considered because it is part of the cause for the tribunal. Other steps should have been taken. The extent to which corruption existed should have been visible to all and sundry. The Criminal Assets Bureau could have acted and dealt with the perpetrators without any nonsense or long-drawn out speeches. As Deputy Ring said, the sad part of the tribunal system is that it reflects poorly on the institutions of the State and all politicians. It is all very well for the Government to be able to spread the mire evenly across all politicians and taint everybody with one brush.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Planning should be in the hands of elected public representatives who are accountable to the public and can be dismissed at election time if they do something wrong. The decision on all land zoning and development should be taken in public, in the area affected by the review of the plan at a given time. When I was a member of my local authority in Kildare, I tried to get that measure approved. Of course, no one wanted it, since there were always politicians who wanted to give their own version of what was happening inside closed meetings. The version that appeared in the press was not necessarily a true or accurate account of what had taken place behind closed doors. I say that simply because I believe that it should be open to public scrutiny, above board, within the rules and in the public arena where everyone can see what is going on. People should not have a secondhand version of events.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_275">I am worried about what I see as the closure of the tribunal system since, whatever the agenda that it set out to follow, it has not yet achieved that to any great extent. I do not know what the purpose of the exercise was or is. I do not know what we have achieved, but we have spent a great deal of money. All we have got out of it is entertainment, something that Deputy Ring mentioned. I can fully understand why he feels somewhat aggrieved in not having advanced himself further at an earlier stage, in which case he would be able to perform on the radio at night. There is a difference between the carefully modulated tones of the senior counsel asking where the witness got the money and the latter's reply, "I do not know, Your Honour. It just fell into me hands." As the Minister knows full well, we hear it regularly. It is very entertaining but also very demoralising from the point of view of hard-working public representatives who try to do their job. I do not know what has been achieved other than certain aspersions being cast across the board on the entire concept. We are about to replace it now with something else of which I am simply not sure.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I find it very difficult to understand how someone can go to a group of public representatives involved in a process with a sack full of money, offer it to them and walk away. I simply do not understand how that works, but there must be someone out there who can tell me. If one applied the same principles to every other function that public representatives — or anyone elected, selected or delegated responsibility on behalf of the public — carry out, with someone going around offering a suitcase full of money pell-mell to achieve a purpose, there would be some extremely strange decisions.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_277">Before I address the Bill's details, it is important that I state the damage done and the negative image of politicians among approximately 30% of the population. I am sick and tired of getting it in the neck when working or on walkabouts in my constituency. I call it the "you are all the same" syndrome and find it maddening when I hear that said. We are not all the same, and we are not all on the take. Those politicians who have damaged politics must stand up and be counted. Those corrupt politicians are responsible for approximately 30% of the population having turned their backs on politics. We must face that reality and end the cynicism, misinformation and corruption in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The media are not squeaky clean on this issue either, and I have been deeply disturbed by the lack of serious investigation into certain issues, particularly by the print media. I also have grave concerns at the lack of serious investigation into such issues as the theft of the sample from Cian O'Connor's horse, Waterford Crystal. That operation took power, a great deal of money and sophistication, and it needs further investigation. I raise that issue now because not only is politics damaged; so is public trust in the media. I urge decent and honest journalists to stand up and be counted before it is too late. As well as social exclusion, there is also political exclusion. If one stands anywhere outside the box, one is a target for ridicule and misinformation with a clear political bias. I speak for working people on this issue and urge an end to the sleaze in sections of the media and also to corruption in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">For the next election, for example, in my constituency, over 10,000 voters have been removed from Dublin North Central and dumped in Dublin North East and Dublin North West. The current four-seat constituency will be a three-seater in 2007. There should be a public inquiry into how the north side of Dublin has been treated regarding representation and democracy. Three-seat constituencies are good for the major political parties and a bonus for the rich and powerful. However, I will fight on defending the interests of working people, the disabled and the poor. I have no problem taking on three millionaires in my constituency at the next election. I raise this issue because of the links between political and social exclusion and the scandals and tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">On 17 November 2004, motions were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas amending the terms of reference of the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, the Mahon tribunal. This legislation is required to underpin the discretion given to the tribunal in paragraph J(6) of its amended terms of reference. The terms will permit the tribunal to decide on the matters that it will investigate. I welcome this legislation and will be supporting it. I long for the day when the tribunals cease and the entire people can have full trust in politicians and the political system. I also long for the day when the fat cats and wealthy sectional interests avoid politics and keep their noses out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I despair when I see what is happening in Ireland and other countries. Big money and big business are choking democracy, and I urge all Deputies who respect our democratic values from all sides of the House to stand up and be counted by supporting this legislation. Whether in Dublin North Central or in Venezuela, people power must always be nourished and protected as a very important part of our democracy. That is why I welcome this legislation and will be supporting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">We were once known as the land of saints and scholars. Ireland today is better known as the land of scandals and tribunals. Politics, banking, the church, business, law and the gardaí have all suffered from an erosion of public confidence in the wake of an astonishing proliferation of scandals. Moreover, Ireland has undergone rapid social, economic and political change over the last decade, which has had a profound impact on our value system. For example, the decline in authority and influence of the Catholic Church and other churches in recent years has forced many people to seek other sources of ethical and moral guidance. That is also very much part of this debate. People are now searching. They have lost trust in politicians, the church and sections of the media and big business; they are looking for a value system. We must be part of that debate and process.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Currently a debate is going on regarding the peace process in our country. All sides are directly involved in it, something that I welcome and encourage. However, we must also have a debate in this House on the direction of the country. Over the last few weeks, particularly in the budget, we have made some attempt to redress the balance. I have talked of the improvement of services to people with disabilities, which is a major step in the right direction; I commend those directly involved in it. However, we must waken up to the reality that it is merely a step. The negative drift in this country has been having a major, harmful impact on society and the economy. All that one need do is consider the anti-social behaviour, crime, social exclusion, litter and dumping problems. Such issues are symptoms of a society that is sick and has major difficulties. We should not have such a situation, particularly in an extremely wealthy economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Ireland at the beginning of the 21st century is a fairly prosperous country, yet that creates its own dilemmas. Difficult decisions about the distribution of resources raise awkward questions for society. How is the tension between the rights of individuals and the overall good of society to be resolved? To whom do we look for political guidance? Is it the political elite, the churches, the medical and legal professions, or business leaders? All of them have had their credibility seriously tainted by the damage emerging from scandals. We need a hard-hitting and incisive analysis of the ethics and values or the lack of same in Irish society. This must be linked with the debate on the tribunals. Many of us have suffered because of the actions of some politicians, business people and officials, and this issue is regularly raised by constituents. It is important that we stand up and say that today.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">It is essential that there is cross-party consensus on this issue. We have had examples of corruption and sleaze in a number of the major political parties and among business interests and planning officials. From talking to Deputies, many of them are concerned about the potential for corruption by officials throughout the State. We will have to face up to that issue. In regard to such corruption, politicians get it in the neck, so to speak. We are trying to get our act together to clean up politics, but there is an undercurrent in society who believes that there are still major problems in our planning system. I have heard that view expressed by people in different counties and have talked to officials who were offered bribes in various cases and who ran the people who offered them. I have been astounded by some of the stories I have heard in the past two and a half years since I was elected to the 29th Dáil. These are important allegations which I do not make lightly. I have listened to and want to listen to further such allegations, but I want to ensure we get evidence. As part of the debate on the tribunals, we will have to face up to this reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">We must move away from the money and greedy society where the winner takes all. The distribution of wealth and resources in our society must be seriously examined. We cannot have a system where 30% of the electorate do not participate in the democratic process. Usually, these people are totally excluded. Many of them are young people who do not care and who think politicians are all the same. Others include members of the public who have got sick and tired of the whole thing. There are also those affected by the spoilt brat syndrome. A section of our population do not vote because they believe they made the society wealthy without the politicians and they carry on as if they have no regard for politics. I meet many of those people in my political life. We must face up to these realities and deal with the facts and issues arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I urge Members to support this legislation, deal with the issues, reflect on what is happening in broader society, not only among politicians but also among those in officialdom and in the business sector. We have heard in recent days about what happened in the banks. These are all classic examples of what is going wrong in our society. I welcome the debate and the opportunity to record my views. I support the legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_288">In this truncated debate it is difficult in the time allowed to properly assess the value of the tribunal as we explore how it can be structured to bring it to finality and, ultimately, to reach conclusions. It is worth reminding everybody concerned that the culture which brought about the need for a tribunal is something in which none of us in the political process should take great pride. The public cynicism that existed prior to the tribunals, that was fed by the revelations of the tribunals, exists to a large degree because the political system has not brought about the necessary changes to instil the necessary degree of public confidence that what has happened will not happen again, and it may still be occurring among some elements of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">My party is generally supportive of the need to restructure the tribunals and put in place the suggested amendments to limit and bring about the final report of this tribunal. Our concern, which is shared by many others, relates to the modules that would be affected. Some would be lost, some would be left in limbo and some would be left incomplete. In the process involved in deciding which modules should come to a conclusion and in respect of those which should be left behind we need to ask serious questions. Ultimately, there are answers to a series of questions that we would like brought forward at the end of the process. We need to be clear about how that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">This is a technical Bill about the administration of the tribunal. This debate offers us an opportunity to talk about the generality of the culture surrounding not only this tribunal but politics. It is curious that several years down the tribunal road we still have not brought about the necessary political reforms that would allow us to avoid the need for tribunals of this type in the future. It is still not possible for Members of this House to ask direct questions and get direct answers.</p>

That is what happens in the Scandinavian model, and that is why it does not have these types of political and other difficulties that arise here far too frequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The Minister will have noted the amendment, to which I am sure my colleague referred, which we tabled to the Bill. We tabled this amendment to the original terms of reference of the tribunal and in respect of the assessment of the terms of the reference that occurred a number of years ago. The amendment proposes that the proceedings of the tribunal should be televised live, recorded or published by way of live-streaming on the Internet. The tribunal has had its most successful public impact not from the turgid accounts of written words we see in many of our newspapers but from the re-enactment of the proceedings on the "Tonight with Vincent Browne" show and other RTE programmes by Malcolm Douglas and the second actor who does most of the voices of the participants, Joe——</p>

We believe there would be a value even in the remaining lifetime of this tribunal if the reactions of those who remain to be questioned and who remain to respond in respect of whatever modules remain to be investigated could be gauged through live media. Whether the Government is prepared to do this remains to be seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">In the United States there is an ongoing procedure in terms of certain commissions inquiring into the quality of public life, and a dedicated television channel in the CSpan Network covers such proceedings. Given that we have the technology to record and transmit such proceedings, I see no reason the work of the tribunals could not be televised in a parallel fashion. To return to the question of lessons not learned and the lack of real change as a result of the tribunal process, it is sad also that while we no longer see large amounts of money changing hands or the speculation that necessitated the tribunals——</p>

          <p eId="para_305">Let us hope it is open in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">No lessons seem to have been learned at local authority level. Resources are not given at a national level to local authorities to allow them to improve their planning sections. There are still local authorities seeking and giving planning permission without trained planners on their staff. The planning enforcement sections of local authorities are a joke because they do not have the resources to act in cases of bad planning and seek proper planning or bring prosecutions. Planners cannot put sustainable planning in place through the development plan process because such planning is being overturned by representatives of political parties engaging in a repetition of the type of behaviour that led to setting up the tribunals. It is sad that after a long-running tribunal process which has been largely successful, which has brought in additional tax revenue, has helped to pinpoint where bad behaviour occurred, and even helped to improve some areas of legislation, the basic lessons, the first principles we should put in place in terms of public confidence in the planning process, do not seem to have been learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">We have a new Minister and maybe he has something up his sleeve. Perhaps he will introduce legislation to improve planning departments in local authorities. Ultimately, however, that means providing resources, and we have seen nothing in the most recent Book of Estimates that targets that area. Since the tribunal process began there has been a glut of building development — 80,000 units in the past year alone. However, there is a total mismatch between what is being provided and the needs of the people who require housing. Many of the new units are second home or holiday home developments. Many of them are of a size that does not meet the needs of people on the housing lists. There is a mismatch between private developments and social housing. Because these imbalances exist, because there is a lack of clear policy, an absence of any strategy, the climate that brought about the events that led to setting up the tribunal of inquiry into planning matters exists now as much as it ever existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The job for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government involves not merely tweaking a few knobs to bring to an end a particular inquiry. The larger picture includes the job of bringing about public confidence in a planning process which is still as bad as it ever was before the tribunal of inquiry started.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_309">I support the Bill. Everybody is aware that Exchequer funds are limited and that we should strive to use them to good purpose. Value for money is something we hear much about. We are making changes in the health services and bringing in a new Health Bill to improve accountability. One problem with that Bill, which we can explore this afternoon, is that democratic input seems to have been thrown out. I hope that can be brought back by way of amendment. The new health legislation is about money and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">People ask whether the tribunals have been worth the enormous costs incurred. The answer is that they have been worth it. What they did is magnificent. The other side of the coin, what really concerns people, is seeing lawyers getting a couple of thousand euro a day. People believe money would be much better spent in other ways. I have been raising in the Dáil for the past few weeks the case of a constituent who needs dialysis but he is too sick to travel. The treatment is available in his home town of Castlebar. However, there are not enough resources to put on an extra shift and allow this man and six others to be treated locally. The reason is lack of money and a recruitment embargo. The alternative is to travel to Galway, a distance equivalent to travelling from Dublin to Galway. It would mean travelling three times a week, a distance of approximately 1,000 miles.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">That is an example of what has been happening. Members of this House constantly speak about the need for better health services, the need for more nurses and doctors. It boils down to resources and we are told that resources are finite. Therefore, anything that constitutes a move towards rationalising what is spent and what is spent unnecessarily is good. There must be a balance. This Bill is about getting a balance, about doing what needs to be done to assure the taxpayer that justice is being done, that there is openness, transparency and accountability, that taxpayers' hard-earned money is not wasted but is used to good effect. I support anything that achieves that.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">People welcomed the major bills sent to people who obstructed the tribunals, people who cost the taxpayer money by extending the time the tribunal had to spend in getting basic information from them in order to make a decision. The public very much welcomes the fact that people such as Ray Burke, George Redmond and others are being made accountable and made to pay the price for their activities, and admire strong moves to make them pay for obstructing the tribunal and wasting taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Openness and transparency in planning is extremely important, particularly in rural areas where the population has dropped. There are many people who wish to live in rural areas but are unable to do so because they have nowhere to live. Even if there are economic advances in a local area and an enterprise sets up there, it often transpires that the people who work in that enterprise cannot live in the area, and people blame the planners. I do not blame the planners. We have excellent planners in Mayo County Council who do a very good job. They work to guidelines and under direction. These guidelines and directions have very much a centralising agenda as far as I can see. There seems to be a city and town planner mentality in which planners have trained and towards which they are geared. The guidelines on once-off rural housing are a move in the right direction, but we must recognise what is happening on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">As someone who has been involved in a practical way in trying to retain people in their own area, I described many years ago the vicious circle of depopulation and a continuing loss of services. If there are no basic services in an area it loses the people. Who wants to live in an area where there is no doctor, no chemist, no place to post a letter, where there is no garda, no protection from marauding criminals? Who wants to live in an area without the basic services that are necessary to allow people to live there? People have to go further and further to get basic services. There must be recognition that the people of rural Ireland matter also. For this reason, I welcome the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Roche, to whom I pay tribute for his positive comments in regard to supporting those in rural Ireland. This requires a person of courage. I know the Minister has courage and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has been also been helpful in this regard. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is in a good position to make progress. I admire Deputy Roche and know he will do much in regard to planning issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">We need openness and transparency. I previously suggested the development of a monitoring system, a matter with which I was involved in regard to the rural water programme. There is much begrudgery about what is available for rural services when compared with services in urban areas for which money is ploughed in on the understanding it is needed. It must be recognised that proper planning and balanced regional development can make all the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">To return to the local context of planning and transparency, what is a more basic infrastructure issue than housing and what is more important to a person than to have a place to live? The departmental guidelines refer to people as mere additions to cities and towns. What of those who want to live in rural areas? I have had significant local difficulty in extending St. Brendan's village because there is a bias against this type of community development. There seems to be an open door for anyone with any difficulty with private enterprise. I have had objections from anonymous objectors. Objectors can write in, giving only a name and address, and this is taken as a legitimate objection. The Minister should investigate this issue as it delays the process and costs the taxpayer money. It is another area without openness or transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">This web of intrigue spreads within the planning system. What is wrong with an open system? Nobody agrees with speculation on land or the taking of massive profits at the expense of those who must live on that land thereafter and pay back with their hard-earned cash the original cost of the land. Instead, most are in favour of people being able to live in their own areas. This is not happening, which is why planning issues need to be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Arising from the operation of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, I suggested the establishment of a monitoring system which is in place and working well in regard to the rural water programme. The monitoring system is a way of ensuring the proper roll-out of the rural water programme but also a way of again bringing democracy to that programme. This could be achieved for the planning process with the establishment of a planning monitoring committee. The national rural water monitoring committee is composed of stakeholders from national organisations such as the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. It also includes the Minister's representative and an independent chairman. Why not have a similar committee for planning issues? Just as the national rural water monitoring committee has an input into what happens locally, why not have a planning monitoring committee which would be composed of stakeholders from rural areas as well as elected representatives? The people are anxious to have openness and transparency but this extends across the board.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_319">I thank Members for a thorough, wide-ranging and, on occasion, colourful debate. The basis of the Bill has been well explained as we have discussed this matter on a number of occasions. Members will agree with the Government that the tribunal must be in a position to efficiently, effectively and in a timely way do the job for which it was established. It needs to be able to uncover the truth of the events alleged and bring some finality to its work. At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure the tribunal completes its work at the earliest possible date, with which most speakers agree. It is of concern to all that the matter would be brought to finality. It is certainly a concern that issues in regard to corruption in the planning process would be fully aired, and that we would have the benefit of the tribunal's views, particularly in the matter of further improvements that could be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">In advance of amendments being put forward, Members will know my hands are tied with regard to requests to make changes to the terms of reference of the tribunal. Under the 1998 Act, the tribunal must either request a particular change or consent in advance to the change. I would not disagree with the points made by a number of Members that we unduly tied ourselves in this regard. We will learn with the benefit of hindsight. Whatever my views on the amendments, I am not in a position to accept them.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Deputy O'Dowd made a number of interesting points, for which I thank him. His observations on the need for the tribunal to give some findings on the issue were interesting and I am sure they have been noted in the appropriate place. He also made a useful proposition that we need to continue the process of legal change. We have made significant legal changes but we need to make sure those work within the system. I welcome the positive points made by the Deputy and also the point made by Deputies O'Dowd, Gilmore and Haughey about having a discussion on the issue at the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government. I agree strongly with the view of all three Deputies that the Oireachtas joint committees have been under-worked in many ways and that they are the appropriate forum at which we can pool our resources and the combined wisdom of all sides of the House. It has become virtually a mantra that wisdom does not reside simply on one side of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_324">I sympathise with the intention. Deputy Gilmore made reference to events in July last in my county, Wicklow. I still believe planning should be decided at local level. It is a model which is widely followed in European countries, is open and transparent and, above all, democratic. I would not like some form of super-quango established effectively to carry out the business of planning behind closed doors. This would be a backward step, although I understand fully the motives behind it. Deputy Gilmore made a good point in regard to continuity within local authorities. In the recent past, at least one council got itself into trouble because it deferred making planning decisions before the election, which was the decision of the elected members. If the council had made the decisions, as it should have, it would not have found itself in a mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Deputy McCormack referred to the manner in which tribunals operate, as did many other contributors, and to the procedures applied. Deputy Ring colourfully suggested that RTE should televise tribunal proceedings. This matter was decided in the case of this tribunal by the original chairman and it is not up to me to visit the issue retrospectively. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will bring forward further proposals in regard to the legislation on tribunals in the new year, which may be the time to consider this. Some of the more nonsensical procedures would not be in place if the public were allowed to know what was happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Deputy Gilmore reminded us why in general the Bill was necessary and we must remember that what happened did happen. However, the Deputy specifically asked why this Bill was required. The Bill is introduced specifically to address the issue which arises as to the use of discretion. The strong legal advice is that this discretion could not be exercised unless the necessary legal change took place. The Deputy referred to my confidence in the tribunals. He could have referred to my hope in the tribunals. It has been stated that this tribunal will conclude its work by March 2007. Public patience would certainly run out if it was to run beyond that.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">With regard to Deputy Gilmore's point that the wording of the Bill is rather negative, while I would not disagree with the Deputy, the words used were specifically requested by the tribunal. The legal advice is that the language in the terms of reference is sound and will work, allowing the tribunal to exercise its discretion effectively. Deputy Gilmore also cited the way in which the tribunal operates, as did almost all speakers, including Deputies McCormack and Morgan. Deputies Gilmore and McCormack made a specific and interesting observation about the manner in which matters of fact are dealt with. That is a matter for the tribunal and I have already said I am reluctant to start telling it how to do its business. However, the points were well made.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">A number of contributions were very colourful, particularly that of Deputy Ring. It is a great loss to the legal profession that he did not go on to become a barrister. I am sure they would have enjoyed him in the musty corners of the Four Courts, although we would have been denied him if that had happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Again, I thank Members for their contributions. I am not in a position to accept the proposed amendments. That does not arise from either intransigence or arrogance, as somebody said recently in respect of legislation. It was said by another Member of this House — whoever secretly writes Drapier. The reality is I cannot accept the amendments because this is the basis on which we tied our hands as far back as 1998. There is a review of the tribunal legislation coming up. It, and the matter of greater public access to the tribunal, will certainly be looked at in the context of that debate.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_332">I wish to raise a concern I have about this section. The Minister responded to the question I asked on Second Stage about why the Bill was necessary in the first place by saying the legal advice he has is that the discretion provided for in the terms of reference could not be exercised without this legislation. The discretion provided in section 2 applies only to paragraph J(6) of the terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The terms of reference, however, in other sections confer discretion on the tribunal. In paragraph J(1), for example, the tribunal is being given discretion to proceed as it sees fit to conclude the modules listed. There is an implied discretion in subparagraph J(1)(g) in regard to modules which are interlinked to those already listed. Presumably, the tribunal will have to exercise discretion as to which modules are interlinked and which are not. In paragraph J(2) discretion is being given to the tribunal to decide which additional matters will go to public investigation. It is required to do that before 1 May 2005, but the discretion will rest with the tribunal as to which matters go to public investigation. In paragraph J(3) it is purported that a discretion is being given to the tribunal whereby if it comes across anything it thinks it should pursue, it may do so. In paragraph J(5) the tribunal is being given discretion to conduct hearings in regard to compliance or non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The problem is the Bill only underpins the discretion in paragraph J(6). It does not underpin the discretion in paragraphs J(1), J(2), J(3) and J(5). Given that the Bill is silent about the discretion which the terms of reference appear to give to the tribunal under those sections, where stand those discretions? The Minister said the legal advice is that the discretion cannot be exercised without legislation. Does that mean if the tribunal exercises discretion in regard to any of the matters under paragraphs J(1), J(2), J(3) and J(5) it could be challenged on the grounds that the Bill giving legal protection to the discretion does not provide for discretion under those paragraphs?</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_335">Paragraph J(6) states that the tribunal may use its own discretion in respect of any matters within paragraphs J(1), J(2) and J(3) and these amended terms of reference decide. To go back to the point I made about the legal view, the Attorney General took the view and gave very strong advice on the need to underpin this discretion with legislation and the tribunal agreed with that view.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_336">I raise this issue because there is no point getting this wrong. We have seen the amount of litigation which arises from the proceedings of the tribunal. In fact, I read a report in this morning's newspaper that there is yet another challenge which, of course, people appearing at the tribunal are entitled to make and to exercise their right. I am concerned a loophole is being created here. Statutory protection is being given to the discretion under paragraph J(6) but not under the other paragraphs.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">For example, paragraph J(4) states that notwithstanding any other provision of these terms of reference, the presentation to the Clerk of the Dáil of an interim report or reports, as the case may be, and of the final report and the matters referred to in paragraphs J(1)(a) and so on shall constitute compliance by the tribunal with all of its terms of reference as hereby amended and no further investigation or report shall be required of or from the tribunal on any other matter. It would appear that the only things the tribunal is required to report on are the modules already listed and the matters related to them. Under the paragraphs to which I referred, it seems that under the terms of reference, the tribunal is being given discretion that it could, at its own discretion, decide to investigate other matters. For example, in regard to the decision which must be made by 1 May next on what matters will go to public investigation, it would appear the intention is that it could include matters outside the list contained in paragraph J(1).</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The problem is that the only discretion being protected by statute is that under paragraph J(6), that is, the discretion whereby if the witness is too old or too sick, if it looks as if it will go on forever or if there is no point investigating a matter. These are basically the common sense provisions which are being protected by statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I raised the issue of Glending before with the Minister, about which he has spoken. If the tribunal gets a complaint about Glending and would like to have a look at it, it seems that because of the confining of the protection to discretion to paragraph J(6), it would not be possible to do that. Somebody could challenge it and could probably argue that because paragraph J(6) was the only paragraph covered by primary legislation, the intention of the Oireachtas was that discretion would be confined to paragraph J(6).</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_110" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_340">It actually does not arise. The discretion available to the tribunal on the matters it may examine are very wide. The tribunal could go right back to the beginning of planning in this country and could review anything in any part of the country, including Glending, so it is not excluded. What the legislation and the section in question do is give it the operational common sense discretion to which the Deputy referred. The Deputy is right that it is common sense discretion but the matters and the time over which the tribunal could investigate have been open from day one. The irony of the way the legislation is drafted is that the one place where the tribunal does not have discretion is in terms of common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">In the earlier debate I gave the example that somebody could argue a councillor or somebody got a payment of €250 or £250. As things stand, the tribunal would have no option but to look into that, to have an order of discovery and to spend €10,000 or whatever on it. The tribunal does not possess the common-sense provisions whereby it could say that would be too resource-hungry a matter to examine. That is the point. If one wants to give the tribunal the right to have common sense, which we did earlier when we discussed its terms of reference, it must be underpinned by legislation now lest the exercise of common sense itself becomes the subject matter of a challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">As regards the issue of time, the tribunal has had that discretion under the original legislation which established it. The Bill before us is to give protection to what the Deputy rightly calls the "common-sense provisions" that most people will regard as existing in the established arrangements. It will give legislative effect to that and will remove it from legal challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">As regards the other issue raised by the Deputy, if, for example, the tribunal decides that an interrelated matter is occurring outside County Dublin, that is a matter in which the tribunal already possesses discretion to become involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_347">That Dáil Éireann, pursuant to Standing Order 128(1) of the Standing Orders Relative to Public Business, directs that the Health Bill 2004 in whole be recommitted to a Committee of the whole House.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I wish to explain why I move this motion. I regret that the Minister for Health and Children is not present but I think it is an indication of the problematic way in which this Bill has been dealt with. A major transformation of the health service is envisaged under the terms of this Bill, which will change radically the relationship between members of the public and the health service upon which they depend. The legislation is being rushed through the House at a disgraceful speed, without proper scrutiny, preparation or consultation. People with an interest in knowing what is going on with these changes have not had a chance to read the proposed changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">On Committee Stage we had an enormous number of amendments proposing radical changes in the relationship between the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children. In effect, the Health Service Executive, through its chief executive officer, who is the sole accounting officer, will be responsible for a budget comprising €8 billion of public moneys, and the figure is rising. That, in itself, is a serious change.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Some 140 amendments, spanning 72 pages, have been tabled for Report Stage. Some of them will not increase accountability, as the Minister promised, but will reduce it. We are not yet living in a dictatorship. I ask the Government to meet its obligations concerning public accountability and ensure that legislation is sound, which is doubtful in this case because of the speed at which the Bill is being rushed through, and properly scrutinised, although that is clearly not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Major changes are envisaged on Report Stage. The Government's many amendments were furnished to Opposition spokespersons last night, but that is unacceptable. Nobody has the right to abuse the Oireachtas in this way. I realise that the Minister of State is caught in a bind because it is not his Bill. The Minister for Health and Children should be here to take the Bill. The reputations of both the Minister of State and the Minister are being seriously damaged by this headlong rush whereby the Bill must be passed, no matter what the cost to accountability and good, responsible legislation. As far as the Government is concerned, it does not seem to matter a damn. The Government just wants to drive the legislation through relentlessly, but that is not good enough. The Bill should be recommitted.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">It took approximately two years for the Health Act 1970, which established the health boards, to pass from publication to implementation. With this Bill before us, which proposes to dismantle the health boards and goes much further in dismantling the normal accountability of a Department, it is taking a matter of days to pass through the Houses. We have no chief executive officer and do not have a health service executive either. There are serious industrial relations problems. The likelihood is that the lack of partnership and union co-operation will worsen because of what is being done here. I urge the Government to accept the motion for recommittal so that we can do our job properly and effectively.</p>

          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_354">I support the motion. Deputy McManus and I submitted at least 90 amendments on Committee Stage. We allowed for that Stage to be moved along speedily and efficiently because we were promised there would be no guillotine on Report Stage, that our amendments would be taken on board and that we would clearly understand where our amendments stood on Report Stage. We have only just received the book of amendments for Report Stage but, unfortunately, some of the Minister's amendments are not included. Time constraints have prevented us from speaking to the voluntary sector, patients' representatives and health service employees, including unions and professional bodies, all of whom will be affected by the legislation. We have had no opportunity to consult those concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Reading through the amendments as presented this morning, I found it difficult enough to find where my amendments have been placed. I have no idea whether the Minister has genuinely taken on board what was said on Committee Stage. It is not crystal clear. An example of this lack of clarity can be found in regard to the effect of this legislation on the ability of Members of this House to make representations. Amendment No. 79 makes some reference to Members getting answers from the HSE. The provision is not clear, however. A significant number of amendments were put through on Committee Stage which asked for information to be made available to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and to Deputies by the Minister, the chief executive officer and board of the HSE, advisers, local authorities and other statutory agencies. It is impossible to discover whether our amendments have been taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">We are expected to go through this legislation in less than three hours. The enactment of the Bill will entirely change the manner in which the health service is run. It will assign power to 11 people to manage €11 billion of taxpayers' money in the context of a lack of clarity regarding the procedures for accountability. I am sure the Tánaiste will say that some of our concerns have been taken on board. However, it is interesting to read some of her amendments. For example, the amendment relating to the provision of information to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children uses the word "or" rather than "and-or". This means that either the Minister or the committee will get the information. Presumably, committees will receive such information if they request it.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">There is a distinct lack of transparency and accountability throughout the legislation. I am afraid the Bill does not look after the concerns of patients and health service employees. In years to come, there will be no accountability in the health service. I strongly support the motion to recommit the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_358">I support the previous two speakers. I regret that the Tánaiste cannot be here to listen to Members' contributions. She told us on Committee Stage that she was listening attentively and would take on board our concerns. The most significant of these concerns is that the legislation is being rushed through the House with unseemly haste. It is unacceptable to process legislation in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">It became clearer with every minute we spoke on Committee Stage that this legislation had not been properly thought out. The concept sounded fine in theory. When we got down to the detail, however, the problems were obvious. For example, the basic difference between the role of the chief executive officer of the HSE and that of the corresponding interim position had not been teased out. Many unforeseen hurdles arose and it was left to the Tánaiste to amend the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The Tánaiste has described the Bill as historic and this is true in the context of health legislation. It represents the most significant overhaul of the health services since the Health Act 1970. Clearly, legislation of such importance should be afforded much time and thought in an effort to tease out every eventuality. The Tánaiste is aware of the concern I expressed on Committee Stage that the most important area of accountability has been bypassed. The Tánaiste claimed to share this concern but I do not see that reflected properly in the amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">We cannot proceed in this fashion. The Bill has been rushed through and guillotined. The guillotine has been used on many occasions by this Administration to the detriment of legislation and in a manner that undermines the House. This Bill serves to move power away from the Dáil and give it to unelected persons. This is fundamentally wrong and is the reason I am opposed to the legislation and, in particular, the manner in which it is being processed.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">Before I speak to my amendment, I welcome the Tánaiste to the House. We spent ten hours debating the Bill on Committee Stage, during which we called no divisions. The Tánaiste agreed to consider most of our amendments and to come back to us on Report Stage. Having read the Report Stage amendments last night it is very difficult to know whether she has incorporated our amendments and if so where they are in the legislation. Unfortunately this will probably slow down this afternoon's proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">We received representations from a number of voluntary, patient and professional organisations. They have had no opportunity to give us their input on the Report Stage amendments. After Committee Stage the Irish Hospital Consultants Association stated that its disciplinary procedures did not appear to be covered by the HSE. While I am not sure whether that is true, we have had no opportunity to review the Report Stage amendments. Next week we might find that a number of provisions have been omitted from the legislation and we will have no opportunity to discuss them.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I am concerned about the issue of transparency in this legislation. During the afternoon I hope the Minister will indicate where my amendments have been included and I am sure the same applies to Deputy McManus and the other Deputies who speak on the health portfolio. I am concerned about how patients will be treated individually. None of my amendments seems to have been adopted in the section on complaints. No changes have been made as to how individuals may complain in that section. I am also concerned about the 100,000 HSE employees. The chief executive officer will have huge powers under section 19 and again none of my amendments seems to have been adopted.</p>

The Report Stage amendments were given to me last night and it is very difficult for me to know where my proposals are contained in them. We sought the postponement of this debate as we have had insufficient time to read the amendments. We must make that point clear before starting Report Stage. While I know I am supposed to talk about amendment No. 1, the way we are going about this is disgraceful. It is quite possible that the amendments that affect the Deputies will not even be reached this afternoon. We spent ten hours on Committee Stage without divisions so that we could have a smooth passage for the legislation. I have no idea——</p>

We have had last minute phone calls telling us the amendments were in our cubbyholes and we have not had the opportunity to scrutinise them in the detail required. To save time in the House I ask the Tánaiste to outline where our concerns have been incorporated into her amendments.

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_489">It might be helpful for me to intervene at this point. Many of the issues raised by Deputies on Committee Stage concerned the accountability of the Health Service Executive. I have tabled amendments that will oblige the Minister to lay before the House a copy of any directives given; oblige the Minister to publish the names of persons appointed to the board in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>; enable the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to summon the chairperson or in his absence the chief executive or senior management of the executive; oblige the Minister to lay copies of service plans and amended plans before the Houses of the Oireachtas; oblige the executive to publish service plans; and enable the Minister to make regulations governing the executive’s dealings with Members of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The accountability matters are covered in amendments Nos. 8, 9, 20, 40, 42 to 46, inclusive, and 130. Superannuation issues are addressed in amendments Nos. 55 and 56. Consequential amendments affecting the service plan are dealt with in amendments Nos. 75 and 76.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I have taken on board many of the suggestions made and will also be making regulations on matters where regulations are more appropriate than detailed legislation. It is not possible to write into legislation the detail of how the executive should deal with queries from Members of the Oireachtas etc. As that is a logistical issue, it will be addressed by way of regulation, as will many other issues. Any regulations made would clearly need to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas etc. Suffice it to say that many of the issues concerning strengthening accountability have been addressed in the amendments I have tabled today.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I have also tabled a number of technical amendments to address issues raised. I flagged these at the end of Committee Stage last week.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">We recognise that health and personal social services are provided not only by the bodies named in Schedule 1 and defined in section 56, but also in practice by other bodies and groups, either contracted by or on behalf of one of the stated bodies, which are the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In practice we are well aware that many services come under the broad definition of health and personal social services and those that fall clearly under Schedule 1, which is the outline of all the Acts that come under the definition of health and personal social services. This section of the Bill states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_496">''health and personal social services'' means services that immediately before the establishment day were provided under the Acts referred to in Schedule 1 by a specified body as defined in section 56.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I have referred to that. It is important that we recognise that other bodies act on behalf of the list of those that appear in Schedule 1. I urge the Tánaiste to accept that this is a better presentation of the intent of this section and that by changing it to "by or on behalf of", we will ensure it is fully inclusive and encompasses and incorporates all the various health and personal social services available directly from the board or presented on its behalf or on behalf of any of the other named bodies in Schedule 1.</p>

          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_498">The Acts in Schedule 1 permit the health boards to make arrangements with service providers for the provision of services on their behalf. As the executive is required to continue to provide the services provided by health boards under the Acts specified in Schedule 1 prior to establishment day, this is sufficient to require the executive to provide these services.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_499">This is a useful proposition that is clearer because of the addition of the words "or on behalf of" following "by". Each of the raft of different bodies — the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the area health boards, the hospital bodies administrative bureau, the Health Boards Executive, the General Medical Service payments board, the Health Services Employers Agency and the interim health service executive — in their respective responsibilities have either engaged, contracted out or embraced the services being provided by independent bodies that are an essential element of the overall delivery of health care and personal social service needs in this State, particularly in the community and voluntary sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The wording as presented is specific, stating "by a specified body as defined". Many of the services to which I refer are not directly provided by those bodies created by the Acts listed in Schedule 1. This is a useful and wise amendment that clearly indicates that it is the service that is the priority, not the body or institution, which is vital in this instance. I commend the amendment to the Minister and ask her to re-evaluate the position she has articulated and to accede to the proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">The executive is required to have regard to services provided by others. In sections 38 and 39, we deal with future arrangements to be covered. Section 38 makes it clear that the executive may, subject to available resources, enter into terms and conditions, as it considers appropriate, for an arrangement with the person for the provision of a health or personal social service. These sections make explicit provision for the basis on which the executive may enter arrangements with service providers. Any arrangements or contracts with health boards continue within the executive on establishment day so there is no question of current arrangements ceasing and there being a vacuum. There will be continuity in any contracts or arrangements health boards have entered into with service providers.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_504">"7.—Subject to the provisions of this Act and the resources available to the Executive, the primary function of the Executive is to take such steps as are open to it to ensure that each person in the State is facilitated in availing of an individual entitlement to such health services and personal social services as are appropriate to meet the needs of that person.".</p>
          <p eId="para_505">This amendment was resubmitted because it is central to the Bill. The Bill does not contain a mission statement for the health services executive. Without this amendment we are simply talking about bureaucratic change and administrative juggling without a statement of the purpose for which all this change has been brought about.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The Tánaiste on Committee Stage rejected this amendment because she misinterpreted the intent, seeing it as being about unlimited rights for the patient or public to access services. That is disingenuous of her. It is clear from the way the amendment is framed that it allows for the inevitable limitations of resources. We all understand health care is about rationing and setting priorities, but if there is administrative change that has no goal other than the mushy aspirations that both the Tánaiste and the interim chief executive officer have expressed, it is not worth a hill of beans.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">If, however, there is a commitment made by way of this amendment to make clear what we are doing, it would be reassuring and would introduce logic to the Bill. Otherwise, the Bill is simply about bureaucracy and may even add to it. The purpose of all this must be spelt out. It is a reasonable amendment and I am astonished that the Minister for Health and Children has misinterpreted it. I hope she accepts this amendment, even at this late stage, and that the matter is treated with the seriousness and clarity with which it is being presented.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">I accept that the Bill is about providing a rights-based approach, subject to resources. I equally said on Committee Stage that this legislation is about a new administrative and management system for the delivery of health care. Separate legislation will deal with eligibility. That will be introduced shortly so I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_509">It is a sad day if the Minister for Health and Children thinks eligibility is about promoting the rights of patients and the public. Eligibility is as much if not more about defining who cannot access services as who can. It is about setting limits. This is about a project to improve patient care, access and excellence across the board. Eligibility is a different matter. The Minister never speaks about eligibility when she speaks about improved patient care. If she spoke about eligibility in the context of the establishment of the Health Service Executive, people would be mystified. We are not talking about eligibility or who qualifies for what, who qualifies for a medical card, yellow pack or otherwise, or who must pay the increased charges that are mushrooming daily. We are talking about the end project. I regret that the Minister for Health and Children appears to be unable to get her head around the idea that it is not good enough to mouth aspirations or give out the clichés such as patient-centred focus or patient-centred service without including them in the Bill. If it is to be a patient-centred change, we must say that. The word "patient" appeared once in the original Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">At this stage I am so befuddled I have no idea how the Bill will end up given all the changes. It is like a serial in a women's magazine. Each month there is a new version and a new chapter. It is the same old formula but it keeps coming back in a different guise. In this instance we need to know its purpose and objective and what people can refer to when they ask what this is all about, as they do in increasing numbers, especially those working in the health service. It deals with confusion but it also sets out a goal.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">The amendments arise from consideration by the Attorney General's Office of two amendments tabled by Deputy Twomey on Committee Stage which incorporate a requirement in section 7(4)(<i>c</i>) on the Health Service Executive to provide advice in respect of its functions that may be requested by the Committee on Health and Children. That is in addition to the requirement in section 7(4)(<i>c</i>) on the Health Service Executive to provide advice in respect of its functions that may be requested by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Deputy Twomey's amendments were accepted subject to consultation with the Attorney General's Office. That office has indicated that problems arise with this approach in relation to the doctrine of the separation of powers which is an important feature of our form of constitutional democracy. As the Health Service Executive is required to provide advice about its functions to the Minister, because the Minister is the person who has political responsibility for the executive to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the line of accountability to the Oireachtas is through the Minister. It would conflict with this to have a Health Service Executive providing advice about its functions to the Oireachtas as well. The Oireachtas committees have the power to call the Minister or the chief executive to appear before them to discuss relevant issues. In addition, the chief executive officer in his or her role as Accounting Officer will be required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>

          <p eId="para_534">I asked the Acting Chairman on a point of order to ask the Tánaiste to outline areas where we will have more accountability and she listed amendments Nos. 8 and 9. How can she say the House will have more accountability under these amendments? We will have less accountability because the reference to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which we are members, is being deleted. It makes a mockery of the way we are processing the legislation because the Bill, as initiated, did not contain this provision. Deputy Twomey suggested the amendment which was accepted on Committee Stage. It is now in the Bill, as amended, and it is being deleted again on Report Stage, apparently on the advice of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The question I put repeatedly on Committee Stage — and other members joined with me in asking this question — is where is the accountability. How will the members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children be involved? Apparently we have the right but, as I said on Committee Stage, the Joint Committee on Health and Children has a majority of Government Deputies and, therefore, we are cut out of the equation. What the Government always wants is more secrecy and less accountability and we have been cut out of the picture. I am afraid the two amendments the Tánaiste said at the beginning of the debate will result in more accountability, will lead to less accountability. I do not know how she can make any other argument.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">I hope our consideration of these amendments this afternoon will not be like Lanigan's ball, with the Tánaiste stepping in and the Attorney General stepping out again. We need to develop some cohesion in the health services. The Tánaiste could have proposed an amendment to provide that "the Minister will endeavour" to inform the Joint Committee on Health and Children. That would have been a poor substitute for the Members of the House, however. The Tánaiste is aware that members of the joint committee have tried since last February to get the Minister for Health and Children to appear before it. Due to time pressures, the Tánaiste and her predecessor as Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, were not in a position to give the committee an account of what the Department of Health and Children is doing. If Ministers do not appear before the committee under the existing legislation, is there any hope that they will do so after this Bill has been passed?</p>
          <p eId="para_537">If the new CEO of the HSE does not want to make himself available to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, he can use the excuses we have been hearing for the past 11 months. I have asked for a small concession, which I do not even consider to be watertight. It would give some semblance of accountability to what is happening with the HSE. It was clearly stated on Committee Stage that 363 people — county councillors, professional representatives and ministerial appointees — were accountable for taxpayers' money. The Tánaiste may argue that their powers were reduced in 1996, but they were still responsible to the public in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Public representatives are particularly keen to ensure that accountability is retained because the public will punish them if taxpayers feel that their money is being thrown away. I proposed my amendment on Committee Stage because the Dáil is the only remaining place where one finds accountability for the health services. The Tánaiste should have made some allowance for that, perhaps by providing that "the Minister will endeavour" to inform the committee, rather than dismissing it out of hand.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">I was incredulous when I saw that these amendments had been proposed because I thought that attempts would be made to strengthen further this Bill, which suffers from a deficit of democracy and accountability, and all that will emanate from it. Amendment No. 11 in my name seeks to extend the executive's remit to the Oireachtas and its joint committees. The amendments before the House, however, propose to delete references in section 7(4)(<i>c</i>) to the “Dáil Committee on Health and Children”. All Members acknowledge that the system that was in place since 1977 was flawed, but at least it contained a semblance of democratic accountability. Many elected public representatives actively participated in the system over many years because they had a role on the health boards, but they will no longer be able to do so. Those who suggest that the consultative health forums are providing anything other than powerless talking shops are codding themselves. Nobody else is fooled by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">It is essential that every measure necessary is taken to widen access to, and accountability for, the delivery of health care. The Joint Committee on Health and Children is central to that work. If we are to achieve the confidence of the wider public, including the service users of the State health care system, we have to demonstrate a clear commitment to democratic accountability. Amendments Nos. 8 and 9, which seek to delete references to the "Dáil Committee on Health and Children", will contribute to a further erosion of confidence in the system that will be introduced in the new year. The amendments are detrimental to the type of health care delivery to which people aspire. I appeal to the Tánaiste to withdraw her two amendments, in the spirit of better accountability to the House and within the House, to ensure that there is some degree of public confidence in what is being promised.</p>

All Deputies agree there is a need for reform. I hoped, on the basis of the Tánaiste's promises, that she would table some good amendments on Report Stage to try to take out of our misery Deputies who have great fears about what the Bill will do or will not do for public accountability. The Tánaiste has claimed that her amendments will address the democratic deficit, but I think they will do the opposite. I cannot see how they will make the system more accountable. I ask her to withdraw the amendments because they certainly do not address the problems I have mentioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">The manner in which the Bill is being processed is evidence of a deep contempt for the work of the Oireachtas. An amendment tabled by Deputy Twomey, which related to accountability to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, was accepted on Committee Stage, but it is now proposed to remove it from the legislation on Report Stage. The Tánaiste has argued that she has received legal advice suggesting that the two functions have to be kept separate. She has also said that the CEO will be required to attend meetings of the committee, on request. She has not referred, however, to her weaselling amendment No. 52, which we may not reach. It provides that the CEO will be able to delegate responsibility for attendance at a committee meeting. The amendment, which proposes to insert a new section 21(10), states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_543">With the permission of the chairperson of the Oireachtas Committee making the request under <i>subsection (1),</i> either—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_544">(<i>a</i>) the chairperson of the Board, or</p>

          <p eId="para_546">may attend before the Committee in place of the chief executive officer</p>

          <p eId="para_549">He or she will come from the Government side of the House. The Tánaiste, who has said that she is committed to accountability, will make the executive less accountable if amendment No. 52 is accepted. Rather than the CEO appearing before the committee, some flunkey or functionary will be given the job of attending a meeting of the committee to give its members any old stuff to keep them befuddled. It is inevitable, when one considers the way in which these institutions typically evolve, that the person who will be given the job of looking after the Oireachtas committee will be asked to percolate as little information as possible to parliamentarians, who are seen as a nuisance. The CEO will be making decisions and doing whatever he or she has to do and wants to do without scrutiny. That is not accountability. The Tánaiste's contemptuous approach involves trying to fool the House into thinking that the amendments she is introducing will increase accountability. While some of the amendments will increase accountability, the balance of her amendments involve a shift in the opposite direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">The CEO, if summoned before an Oireachtas committee, is required to attend except where the provisions of section 52 apply. It was asked on Committee Stage what would happen if the CEO were not available.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_579">(5) In performing its functions, the Executive shall have regard to—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_580">(<i>a</i>) services provided by voluntary and other bodies that are similar or ancillary to the services the Executive is authorised to provide,</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Amendment No. 10 seeks to insert "the need to co-operate and co-ordinate with such bodies" after "provide" at the end of the subsection. That is an eminently sensible approach to the work of the executive. Co-operation and co-ordination with voluntary and other bodies will be essential to the effective, efficient delivery of health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I referred in the discussion on amendment No. 2, to the work of bodies external to the main authorities in the current health care delivery system. It is very important that we recognise the value of the input of the voluntary and community sector in the health services, which input will obviously perpetuate itself in the future. The sector should be regarded as an integral part of the overall health system and should be valued therefor. It should not only be respected but should also be regarded as an equal partner in the areas in which it operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">On the basis of my family's knowledge and experience over the years and because I have a brother with Down's syndrome, I can attest without hesitation to the value of the voluntary and community sector. Throughout our growing years, it was the voluntary sector that covered the need for my brother's care on so many occasions. That reliance on the sector in terms of respite continues. That is the reality for many families throughout the State. If we were to have depended only on the services provided by the State and successive Governments, we would have noted that there would have been no supports at all. I pay tribute to the voluntary and community sector and note all the areas that it has addressed and continues to address. Its input is essential and it represents an integral part of the overall health and personal social services area.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">I agree with the Disability Federation of Ireland that this Bill does not live up to the commitment in the White Paper on the relationships between the State and the community and voluntary sector. One must recognise that the White Paper promised more than mere consultation. It committed the Government to the participation and active involvement of the sector in both decision making and policy formulation processes. We must afford due recognition to the sector and not leave this to a whim. We cannot proceed with a health Bill that completely ignores the input and valued contribution of the voluntary and community sector over decades. It is not enough to say the executive "shall have regard to" the sector. Big deal. When one considers all the families that have depended on the services provided by these bodies and organisations and the real hope and support they have given over the years, one will realise that having regard for them is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">It is essential that the executive and all those who sail on her in the years ahead know exactly what this House requires of them and that it is not left to their whim and discretion to recognise the voluntary sector. It should be clearly stated in legislation that there is a need to "co-operate and co-ordinate with such bodies". The expertise of such bodies and their undoubted commitment in their particular areas of address require more than regard. They should be embraced fully and be understood to be such within the health services. It is essential that amendment No. 10 be considered in that spirit.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Let me speak to amendment No. 15, in both my name and that of Deputy Twomey. I know the Deputy will have further words thereon. I understand the Disability Federation of Ireland presented us with the wording of the amendment. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_587">In page 13, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_588">"(9) In the performance of its functions the Executive shall co-operate and co-ordinate with the voluntary sector where it is involved in activities similar or ancillary to the remit of the Executive.".</p>
          <p eId="para_589">This amendment is giving further expression to the arguments I have presented on amendment No. 10 and is therefore grouped with other amendments that reflect a similar spirit. If the amendment is accepted — I urge the Minister to accept it — this Bill will acknowledge the key role and valuable contribution of the community and voluntary sector and recognise it as an equal health partner. That is the spirit in which we should go forward. The role of the community and voluntary sector must be enshrined in this legislation and amendments Nos. 10 and 15 are designed to accommodate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Statutory recognition, which we hope to achieve, for the community and voluntary health and personal social services sector will greatly strengthen the Health Service Executive and will be seen to have done so. This is a sizeable and formidable sector that commands great respect and regard throughout the State. It is imperative that the wording of the Bill reflect that and not in an aspirational tone on the lines of "must have regard for". We must enshrine it in the legislation, give it due regard and recognition and show the community and voluntary sector that it, and the State, are going forward in partnership to ensure the best quality of health and personal social services delivery that people can expect and enjoy. I commend amendments Nos. 10 and 15 to the Minister and support the other associated amendments in this grouping.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">The six amendments I and Deputy Ó Caoláin moved were discussed on Committee Stage. We acknowledged during that debate with the Minister that not all voluntary and community groups provide services as outlined in the legislation. Advocating on behalf of the patients they represent is just as important. The Minister could argue that five of these amendments do not fit in with the legislation but we hoped that she might take on board the spirit of these amendments when she was reformulating the legislation to bring it back to the House on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">It is regrettable that no concession has been made, considering the great work done by the groups to which the amendments refer. Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to the Disability Federation of Ireland which helped us formulate one of the amendments but many other groups are represented here and some will not have the opportunity to make representations to Members before the legislation goes through. The Minister said on Committee Stage that she would examine ways to give some clear indication of how this legislation might recognise these organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">All too often, as we have seen over the past seven years in Dáil Éireann, many disability and voluntary groups were ignored and underfunded. For the first time ever in a budget, the disability sector received significant funding, not as much as it expected but it is a significant amount. Maybe in the spirit of the Government's change of attitude it should have done something to which it could point. Maybe there is and we have misunderstood the Minister. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to read through the legislation to see if the amendments had been taken on board to any degree and if there was anything we could show these groups to indicate that the Government takes their concerns seriously and is listening to them in a more than patronising way.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Perhaps the Minister can indicate whether she will summarily dismiss the amendments or if she has taken some changes on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_595">I support Deputies Ó Caoláin and Twomey. These amendments go to the heart of accountability. This year's budget is the first I have seen that did anything close to what should have been done in past years for the disability sector, but most services for people with disability are provided through a voluntary sector. In order to get the best possible value from it there should be co-ordination and co-operation because the sector cannot be separated and isolated. If these people vanished in the morning the health boards would have to do the job anyway. Surely under this legislation it is necessary to have nationally based co-ordination and co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The amendments are very sensible. Not alone do they bring voluntary organisations or service providers into the mainstream but they ensure accountability which the disability organisations want, in other words, a sum of money is not simply thrown at particular groups which have no service plan or end goal. The Minister should look seriously at this to see what can be done to bring these people under the umbrella of the health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">I support these amendments because as one who comes from the community and voluntary sector it is obvious there is no way the State could do the work of that sector. Many people, of whom carers are only one example, work and do not count the cost but do it out of love or whatever. In any service there must be co-ordination and co-operation. If this is not for the people who is it for? It is to serve the person. The health strategy puts the patient at the centre of the equation. The voluntary and co-operative sector represents the patient. If it does not have a meaningful input into the HSE I fear for the executive. These are very rational amendments which should be accepted.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_185" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_598">We had a good discussion on these matters on Committee Stage. I am a great fan of the voluntary and independent sector. I believe in a minimalist role for the State in all our lives, including health care. All but two of the hospitals in this city are voluntary, private, independent organisations. The voluntary sector has an important role in the delivery of health services. The Bill imposes several requirements on the Health Service Executive. It must have regard to what the voluntary and independent sector does. Under section 7(1), object and functions, it must ensure that it uses its resources in the "most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public" and in section 7(5)(<i>e</i>) it must “secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of those resources”. It must have regard to things done by ancillary, voluntary or independent groups but it must also ensure that it uses its resources efficiently and effectively and achieves the best possible arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Reference was made to the disability sector and Members welcomed what happened in this budget. In the 1996-97 budget €1 million was given to the disability sector. We have come a very long way since the middle of the 1990s on disability and a host of other voluntary sectors, including education, health care and the welfare system generally, and that trend will continue. There is no question of the HSE not engaging with service plan arrangements, including contracting the voluntary independent sector to provide services. That is how things will be. However, we clearly cannot place them in a legal straitjacket. They must co-ordinate and co-operate with that group, but they need not do so with other professional groups. We must mandate them to do it in an efficient and effective manner. Not every voluntary or independent group or every private operator provides efficiency and effectiveness, and that may not be the most beneficial way of providing resources. Many of the private sector facilities emerging are independent, not-for-profit organisations. Simply because someone decides to provide a service, we cannot oblige the HSE to require it if there is a better, more efficient and effective way of doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The voluntary sector in health care is very large and will continue to be so, whether in delivering hospital services or regarding issues such as meals on wheels or care of the elderly. Whatever it might be, the situation will continue as at present. Nothing changes as a result of this legislation. On the contrary, the powers are enhanced because the executive must have regard based on efficiency, effectiveness and what is beneficial from a resource point of view. Everyone wants the best possible services provided for patients and service users, whether in the voluntary, State or private independent sector. We must take whatever is best for patients and users and provide services accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment tabled. Section 39 of the legislation provides for a situation where the HSE continues to fund a wide range of voluntary bodies that currently provide services or new organisations that may emerge and will provide services.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_602">The Minister must accept that there is scant acknowledgement and only limited recognition of the role of the voluntary and community sector in the legislation as presented. Given the specific and, in most cases, heroic contribution that sector makes to the health and personal social service needs of communities, the legislation falls far short of what is required. No one is arguing that it has a definitive role in determining policy but we are arguing for its right to an input into policy formulation. Consultation is very important, with co-operation on the subsequent outworkings and delivery of that policy and there must be co-ordination or the whole thing will not work. I, therefore, see nothing in amendments Nos. 10 or 15 that runs contrary to the protective position the Minister seems to be taking regarding the executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The legislation, to all intents and purposes, limits the community and voluntary sector to service provision. In any area in which it is referred to, it is seen as something on which one may depend, a crutch to save the State accepting responsibility, as Deputy Lynch said. If it were not there, the onus would surely fall on the Minister's shoulders and those of her Cabinet colleagues. However, it exists and is doing trojan work. It has earned the respect and regard of the entire population. There is no family untouched by the wonderful work of people in the voluntary and community sector in health and personal social services provision, and we all have our own experience of that. Over all those years of committed service, it has earned the right — I emphasise the right — to have a role and input in policy formulation. It should not be at the whim of the executive simply to "have regard to" it, the language used here.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I know that there are time constraints on my second contribution and I appeal to the Minister to examine the wording, which in no way locks the executive, the Minister or her colleagues into an untenable policy position on the health services — far from it. It affords the Minister the opportunity properly to appraise all initiatives and proposals, and the people to do so are those at the coalface of delivering those services. They are the experts in a great deal of what we depend on as a people today. I have no hesitation in saying that I appeal to the Minister emotionally to consider this. I have great respect and regard for those who have given a lifetime of service in this area and whose expertise and warmth in their respective fields and disciplines is truly remarkable and deserving of all our praise. I once again commend the amendments to the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_605">We are focusing on voluntary and community groups. We have mentioned the disability sector several times in the course of the debate and it is an interesting one on which to concentrate. We seek some legislative role for the voluntary sector that the Government might recognise. The Minister can point out how much money was put into the disability sector eight or nine years ago. However, it had to wait seven years for the present Government to put significant funding into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">During the Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, said that the disability sector had been neglected for so long because of persistent lobbying by the primary care and acute hospital sector in recent years. That is insulting both to the families and the disability groups who have been working extremely hard for the past seven years to convince the Government that their situation was dire and that they needed the extra funding that took seven years to come their way.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">That is why those groups are pushing for some role in legislation. Otherwise they will always be at the whim of a Government watching the way the wind is blowing and how it is seen by the electorate before it can make a decision on who gets funding in what sector. In some respects, when this legislation goes through, even the role of the Minister for Health and Children might be in doubt, perhaps being little more than that of a Minister of State at the Department of Finance. It is important that we take on board the issues we have discussed and give them legislative effect. Otherwise, in another five or six years, depending on who is in government, those groups might find themselves back out in the cold again.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_608">It appears from reading the entire Bill and all the amendments that the Health Service Executive will be very much removed from anyone's control apart from that of the Minister, whoever that may be, as Deputy Twomey said. On the other hand, the Health Service Executive will be hands-off, having no role regarding a very large sector providing services. In many ways it is protected on both sides. It has no accountability before elected members and it has no responsibility towards a sector that is doing a great deal of work. I am not certain this Bill is about the provision of health services for the citizen as much as about protecting the executive from any type of intrusion. The Minister should seriously examine these and other similar amendments when we reach them. If the executive is about providing essential health services, it must be not only be accountable but held responsible. These amendments are part and parcel of ensuring that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_609">We hear a great deal of talk about partnership and there are the social partners and so on. These amendments present an opportunity to work in partnership with people who provide health services on a day-to-day basis. The Minister is aware of the problem that arose in the past when groups did not get the support they deserved. These amendments present an opportunity for the executive to act in an inclusive way by working in partnership with these people. It is all fine and well to have regard for a person, but one can have such regard and then go one's own way. We have regard to many people, but that can be all it amounts to. In the spirit of partnership, it is logical that there should be a proper partnership arrangement and these amendments present an opportunity for the executive to operate in partnership with the voluntary and the community sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_190" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_610">There is no point in trying to convince me about this because I am a huge fan of the voluntary, independent sector. Many of the causes of the more marginalised in our society would not have been taken up if it were not for voluntary bodies over the years, many of which involved members of different religious communities. There is no doubt about that. I referred to the fact that of all the hospitals in this city, of which there are many, all but two of them are voluntary hospitals. That is the reality of the health environment and that will not change. The disability sector is one such group in the voluntary sector and there are many more.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Health Service Executive is required, when providing services, legally to have regard to anything that is done by the voluntary sector or the independent sector. Provision is made in section 39 for grant aiding those voluntary bodies. From the debate emerging one would imagine we planned to privatise the health service. Deputy Lynch referred to the executive being an independent body and not accountable to anybody. Deputy Twomey seems to think that the Minister responsible for it will be a Minister of State attached to the Department of Finance. I will not go into the arguments about that as I am aware Members have strong views on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">For the past 30 years we have had the worst case scenario. We have had, effectively, 11 health boards with 11 chief executive officers with responsibility in their functional area for the delivery of health care. However, overall accountability for this area rests with the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children. It did not rest, as some would suggest, with the local representatives who were members of the health boards. That is not a clear line of responsibility and does not deliver clarity or accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">In terms of the provision of a uniform service throughout the country, many Deputies often complain that in one health board area one can get X by way of a service while in another health board area the service is somewhat different. In a country with a population of four million, I am not certain that level of service is satisfactory. A unified system with clear lines of accountability to the Oireachtas, which is the ultimate accountability in our democracy, is the preferred situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The executive will have to provide services on the most efficient, effective and beneficial basis bearing in mind available resources and so on. That is a strong mandate not only to the voluntary sector but to all those private operators or whoever with whom the executive will engage for the provision of services to patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept this amendment. Government policy is strong on consultation with the voluntary sector. The concept of social partnership, which is fundamental to our system of Government, involves the social partners, which includes the voluntary sector, one of the pillars in the social partnership process. It involves that sector in consultation on a range of issues other than pay-related issues. Whether it is development in education or health care, the consultative forum we have in place on many of the changes under way in the health care system involves all the stakeholders, including many of the representatives of the voluntary sector and many of the professional bodies, employee organisations and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Equally, in regard to advisory panels and other aspects of the legislation, section 43 requires the executive to provide for the participation of voluntary groups and advisory panels. If any deficiencies emerge when this body is up and running, there are many ways, including by way of ministerial direction or regulation, by which we can require the executive to do particular things. However, when we are setting up a new unified management administrative system for the delivery of health care to our population of four million, we must make sure we have strong powers from an accountability perspective, in respect of which I disagree with some of what was said earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Equally, we must have flexibility to deal with new situations as they arise and not put too many mandatory requirements on a body that must administer in a system that is changing every year. Complexity in health care, in terms of the technology and the availability of new products in the pharmaceutical and medical devices area, is changing health care rapidly in terms of the procedures available to patients and many other actions that can be taken. We are moving, I hope, towards a situation where more technology will be used in the development of health care. With all those changes, we want to ensure that we have a strong, regulatory framework in the form of the executive, but equally that it has the flexibility to engage with bodies to provide services on its behalf for patients in the best possible, most efficient and beneficial way that can be done.</p>

That is probably the view some us have. Is it not the case that a spokesperson for her party, as recently as in the past fortnight, indicated that she will address some of the deficiencies in the overall health service configuration in terms of the delivery of health services through further privatisation measures?

          <p eId="para_632">I want to reiterate briefly that this is one of the most important elements of the Bill and is no less important than the democratic accountability deficit which we addressed and will address further in the next set of amendments. In terms of the Tánaiste's response where she will make it mandatory on the executive to do A, B and C, we are not seeking to lock it into unworkable positions. We are making it a requirement of the executive to co-operate and to co-ordinate. This executive could not succeed if it did not get the co-operation and co-ordination of the voluntary and community sector in the first place. It is a two-way street. We cannot say to people, to the organisations and religious bodies, to whom the Minister has referred, that we want their co-operation but that we, in turn, are not prepared to give them any substantive role in the development of policy. That is critical because they have the expertise and can make the greatest input. We are denying ourselves because, despite the Minister's assurance that this Bill mandates that it must have regard to the need for co-operation with other public authorities, the executive will in practice fail to have due regard to that need, and certainly not in the spirit of co-operation and co-ordination with the voluntary and community sector which is such an integral factor in the delivery of health and personal and social services in this State. This is a major deficiency and the Government's failure to address it leaves me no choice but to challenge on this amendment.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_750">In page 13, line 11, after "Government" to insert "or resolutions or reports adopted by the Oireachtas or by any of its Joint Committees".</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The amendment seeks that section 7(5)(<i>c</i>) would read: “the policies and objectives of the Government or any Minister of the Government or resolutions or reports adopted by the Oireachtas or by any of its Joint Committees to the extent that those policies and objectives may affect or relate to the functions of the Executive”. It is important that it is not only Government which would have a direct input in determining the overall shape of health and personal social services policy development and implementation. It is imperative the Oireachtas and all its elected Members have the opportunity to have this input, which is what the amendment seeks to achieve in the context of the Houses of Oireachtas and the joint committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">In this instance, I am running contrary to amendments Nos. 8 and 9 which the Tánaiste earlier mooted in regard to the deletion of the phrase "or Dáil Committee on Health and Children". My amendment would require the Executive to take account not only of Government policies but also of the views of the Oireachtas as a whole, which includes its committees. This is imperative.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">With regard to some earlier amendments, it was stated there is a democratic deficit in the Bill. The Tánaiste stated that the role of elected representatives on the health boards was deficient at best. While I agree, they at least had access and opportunity and in many cases played an important role in the defence of health services on boards throughout the State. For all its faults, that role for the elected representative is now gone and the consultative health forums are no more than powerless talking shops. Therefore, there is nothing to compensate for the loss, deficient though the system was, nor does anything in the legislation allow for a direct input by the democratically accountable elected representatives in the State and, importantly, the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and its respective committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">It is, therefore, essential that democratic accountability is provided for as far as possible and the role of Oireachtas Members should be written into the Bill, not just the role of the members of the Government of the day. The Bill states: "the policies and objectives of the Government" but allows no recognised role or input to the wider make-up of the Houses. As matters stand, invariably, if not in all cases, the Government position will be reflected because of its in-built majority. However, by adding the words "or resolutions or reports adopted by the Oireachtas or by any of its Joint Committees", we are at least affording all Members an opportunity to have an input and, I hope, to play a constructive role in debating and determining the shape of health and personal social services policy into the future. I commend amendment No. 11 and the associated amendments Nos. 14, 18, 46, 48, 49, 52 and 130. I hope the Minister will accept amendment No. 11.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">These amendments relate to accountability in respect of Members of the Oireachtas. There is a number of reasons we would like to know about matters. To go back to the previous amendment on disability groups, they will expect 1,000 front-line staff to be employed next year, as announced in the budget. These amendments are the only way we have of finding out whether the Government is fulfilling the commitments it made in the budget last week. The Minister discussed the State's role in health services provision and said she would like to see the State removed as much as possible from it. Unfortunately, that will not happen as quickly as she might think. We would still like information on what the State does in the provision of health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Minister's own baby is the national treatment purchase fund. It has been a very good service for the 17,000 people who have benefited from it. However, I am not aware if a cost benefit analysis has been done on it to see how competitive it is. For a number of years, the waiting list initiative was run concurrently by the health boards. I do not know if a comparison was made between the two initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">When Deputies, journalists and others try to get information on the health services to make comparisons, to get figures to see if the health services are being run efficiently and if value is being achieved for the €11 billion of taxpayers' money and to do a cost benefit analysis on Ministers' pet projects, we need to get full information and we should not be fobbed off with answers telling us to speak to the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">We should keep a copy of the amendments we have tried to make today because in two or three years time many of the Government backbenchers who have not taken too much heed of the debate today might be the very ones looking for such amendments if they are no longer in Government. That is the reason we take this issue so seriously. This reduces the accountability of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the people they represent. There is a large number of issues about which I could talk, including whether this money is being spent efficiently on behalf of taxpayers and whether people are getting the service they expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">This morning the Minister acknowledged there was a difficulty in regard to medical card patients paying charges in nursing homes. It will be interesting to see if anyone with a medical card paying charges to a nursing home will be reimbursed under the legislation. The Ombudsman published a report on this issue two years ago. When this type of information comes into the public domain, it makes us all more accountable to the people who elected us. We should watch out that we do not try to reduce that accountability too much.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Amendment No. 130 states that confidential information has the same meaning as in section 26(3). The next part states "a dealing" in relation to any Member of either House of the Oireachtas means any dealing with any Member in his or her capacity as a Member. What does that tie into? It looks as if it fell out of space and landed in that spot. I do not understand how that improves my accountability to my constituents in regard to the health services if I am looking for information. Perhaps the Minister might explain that. When she spoke about it on Committee Stage, she spoke of a paramilitary sector in the HSE.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_765">I wish to refer to my amendment No. 18 which provides for cognisance to be taken of any recommendations made by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and amendment No. 48 which states "shall come before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to discuss any matters raised by the committee on a quarterly basis at the very least, on days to be arranged with the committee". The Health Service Executive should have some way of communicating with the people and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children is one way to do that since its members are elected and have a special interest in health.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Amendment No. 48 proposes that the chief executive officer appear before the committee on a quarterly basis, which is not too much to ask. On Committee Stage, the Minister said that if the committee is asleep, it will never call the chief executive officer. It is a question of the committee deciding to do just that. As I said on Committee Stage, the non-appearance of Ministers for Health and Children at the committee was very educational. I know the Minister is full of good intentions, and they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. We all have good intentions but unless there is an obligation, it is hard to do everything one intends to do. The Tánaiste is a very busy person but as Minister for Health and Children, she is three times as busy and she has much to do. We know that because already the Minister has been unable to attend the committee, which I understand. The same happened with the previous Minister, Deputy Martin. There must be a requirement to attend. There must be a certain standard. I do not believe that minimum standard is in place to allow any semblance of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">It is obvious this has gone full circle. On my first day in the Dáil, I called for the abolition of the health boards. However, we have thrown out the baby with the bath water and it is time to bring back the baby and have some semblance of democracy. These amendments go some way towards that. The Minister is taking all this upon herself. Responsibility for the whole health service radiates up to the Minister for Health and Children through the chief executive who is in the very precarious position of getting his head chopped off by the Minister and the Government. However, that is the chief executive's problem and I believe Professor Halligan did not accept the job because he did not want to get his head chopped off.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_769">The Minister would be doing herself a favour if she accepted these amendments because she would be sharing the responsibility and she would be fulfilling that democratic need in a more meaningful way if the chief executive officer was allowed to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children four times per year at a minimum.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">We have gone full circle from over representation. I agree with the Minister that there were big problems and that is the reason I was anxious that order be put on the situation. There were 11 health boards each competing with each other and with 11 different software systems or, in some cases, none at all. There was no co-ordination.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">We will have great difficulty getting the chief executive officer to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. According to section 21, when the chief executive officer appears before the committee, he must give an account of the general administration of the executive but we must be able to raise matters which are relevant and pertinent and which mean something to the people we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The Tánaiste said she would return with amendments concerning the issue of accountability with regard to the Oireachtas committee and the parliamentary affairs division of the Health Service Executive. She stated: "I hope members of the committee will be happy when they see them." I am not happy with the amendments, however. I had hoped that she would have done better than this. She should at least accept these amendments. I said this morning that I was disappointed and I was hoping against hope that some of the amendments would be accepted. Let us face it, health boards are being abolished and the chief executive officers will no longer be answerable to them. Elected Members, such as ourselves, are here because of our interest in health matters and a desire to represent our constituents. The Bill would get ten out of ten for accountability and an A-grade for auditing but it fails when it comes to representing people, which is what it should be about. I have to give the legislation a failure mark in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">We are talking about giving elected representatives an opportunity to have a real input into the health system. I agree there is absolutely no co-ordination between the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. We have seen so many bad policies and regrettable decisions. For example, we ended up having a BreastCheck service for half the country, which was decided upon in 2000. It will be 2007 or 2008, however, before the service is extended to the other half of the country, even though radio advertisements for BreastCheck are being broadcast all the time. It drives everybody bonkers in the west when they hear the advertisements advising women to avail of the BreastCheck service.</p>

          <p eId="para_777">There has been a total lack of co-ordination in the decision-making process. While the Bill envisages major reform, it has thrown the baby out with the bath water. It is time, therefore, to recover the baby. I ask the Tánaiste to re-examine these amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_778">I support the amendments and reiterate my concern about the legislation's lack of accountability. While views have been expressed about over-accountability in the old system, it provided public representatives with an opportunity to present cases and raise issues at health board level. In that way they could publicly obtain a response from the executive. That possibility has now been removed. In fairness to the Tánaiste, she said on Committee Stage that she was concerned about this matter. She also said that the issue of accountability through representation would be addressed by the new executive. While we can take her remarks at face value, I would like to hear how this will operate in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I envisage a situation in future where we will be refused information from the Health Service Executive that will feel it is all-powerful and that its work is not accountable to individual politicians, parties or even the Dáil. The executive will only be accountable according to the provisions of the Bill. We need to be in a position to quote the views of the Minister as regards people's aspirations and representations being heard at every level, including local level. Once accessibility, including the freedom to express views, concerns and complaints, is removed, public confidence in the health service will diminish. Regardless of the difficulties involved, including waiting lists and accident and emergency problems, there is a connection between the public and the health service in hospitals and community care centres. Will that connection be removed over time by failure to respond to public concerns about health services? If so, it would be a serious development because the Health Service Executive would be seen as inert, unconcerned and unresponsive to public needs. We must have a health system in which people's humblest concerns can be expressed and responded to.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Some people may say that waiting five hours on a trolley is of no concern because others have to wait for 20 or 30 hours. For a person whose survival is at stake, however, that five-hour period would be of extreme concern to them and their family. We should be in a position to express such concerns on behalf of patients but will the new system allow for that? To be fair, there is a certain level of response at present, depending on the attitude of the chief executive, deputy chief executive or hospital manager concerned. I accept there is a lack of consistency in such responses but at least people's names are known and information can be obtained immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">People need to know what is happening in the health service and understanding attitudes are required. If someone is waiting on a trolley in distress for five hours and his or her family is concerned, the hospital may have another side to the story. When the hospital's viewpoint is expressed to a patient and his or her family, while it does not remove the health problem, it provides them with a better understanding of the difficulties experienced within the hospital. This will now be removed as a result of this legislation. On Committee Stage, the Tánaiste said it would not be removed, but I see no evidence of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Currently, if I make inquiries concerning the future development of national primary or secondary roads in my constituency, I receive only vague information. We are told the Government has a policy on this, that or the other, but my constituents want to know when something is happening. I cannot obtain the relevant details, however, because the National Roads Authority takes its policy from the Minister and the rest of us can wait. I rarely contact the NRA because there is no point in doing so. Prior to the establishment of the NRA, councillors could obtain such information from their local authority. In 99% of cases the county manager or the executive responsible would be only too happy to communicate as much information as possible. We seem to be going in the opposite direction with this Bill. The Tánaiste has heard these concerns but it is only right to reiterate them on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">What is the position regarding the availability of Ministers and the Health Service Executive to appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children? Last March, the committee sought a meeting with the Minister for Health and Children. We were supposed to see him before the summer recess and again in October, but did not. In the meantime, a new Minister was appointed and we were supposed to see her this morning but we could not do so. The Minister said she had to take the Health Bill in the House, which is fair enough, but she has a team of advisers. While we have no advisers, I was prepared to be at the meeting with Deputies Twomey, Cowley and McManus. At this rate, we will probably meet the Minister on the anniversary of our request for a meeting, which is only two months away.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I want to know how concerns and complaints about administrative issues will be dealt with under the terms of the Bill. I asked a question on Committee Stage about raising concerns regarding clinical decisions, but such a process is not envisaged in the legislation. If a patient is concerned about a clinician or a clinical decision, it cannot be raised under the provisions of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The Minister is familiar with a report that I obtained and discussed in the House, in which an independent body expressed significant concerns about clinical decisions in regard to a patient in a psychiatric unit. The patient's family had already expressed serious concerns, which were borne out by the report. One issue highlighted in the report was the failure of a clinician to read a report indicating that the patient was suicidal and in need of constant care. The report also heavily criticised the situation whereby the admitting psychiatrist, who was responsible for making decisions about the treatment of this adult patient, had only three months' experience in child psychiatry. The report also observed that the nursing staff in the hospital failed to read the patient's notes on admittance. These are only some of the issues highlighted in the report. There were ten in total and I could point to 100 more because of my contacts in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Can these types of issues be raised by a concerned family in a similar situation under the provisions of this Bill? Unfortunately, we will probably not have time to discuss the relevant provisions today. It is inadequate for the Minister to say that there is a professional body, such as the Medical Council, to which patients can address their concerns. A distressed person, such as one who has lost a family member through suicide, cannot be asked to go through a complicated and remote procedure to access a body representing the medical profession. An ordinary person with a grievance wants to communicate his or her difficulty to a local public representative, community advice centre, GP or some other local person whom they trust and who can access the relevant information. In most such cases, I can obtain a response from the relevant director of services, deputy chief executive officer, hospital manager or another relevant authority. The response is generally immediate or may take two or three weeks if an issue must be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">This system provides some level of satisfactory explanation. However, it seems that inquiries regarding the decisions of clinicians cannot be made under the new complaints system in which the Tánaiste has expressed such confidence and which she compared on Committee Stage to the service given by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Such a system does offer a level of service and we will be pleased if all queries and concerns regarding the operation of hospitals, community care and all other health service provisions within our area can be addressed. However, if members of the public see that their local Deputies or other significant persons have no role in communicating their concerns and obtaining speedy and detailed responses, a situation will develop whereby people will lose confidence and understanding and become frustrated with the health service. They will conclude that it is pointless to complain and that they must suffer in silence. It is in such circumstances that grievances fester.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">I support Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment No. 11 and Deputy Cowley's amendment No. 18. If one takes an objective view of the amendments that are put forward, and can conclude that they give some teeth and balance to the Bill, it is essential to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I support reform and change in the health service and the urgent need for investment. As I said last week in the House, I support the overall ethos of the Bill and voted accordingly. In this context, I urge the Tánaiste to open her mind to constructive ideas in this matter. We all learn from the different angles and views expressed in the House. The views of Oireachtas Members are essential because we are elected by the people. There is great respect in this House for democratic values and any Minister for Health and Children and any Government must respect that.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">There is great experience in the House in the area of health and disability. There are Deputies who are GPs, health care workers or the parents of children with disabilities. All Members are citizens who have had some experience of the health service and have constructive and positive ideas to put forward. The Dáil represents a great cross-section of society. The Tánaiste should listen to the views expressed in the tabling of amendments. The Government listened in regard to the disability issue, as evidenced in the budget with its provision for a major investment in respite and day care services for persons with intellectual disabilities. I commend and thank those directly involved in the brave decision to take action in this area rather than choosing a popular issue or spreading the money elsewhere. These types of decisions are important. However, I would like to see the role of the Oireachtas written into the legislation as provided for in amendment No. 11. Such a provision will serve to strengthen the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">We need a system of effective measurement. In addition, it is important to have quality management procedures in place in the health system, which are effective in delivering services to patients. That is the bottom line in this debate. We can talk about legislation and amendments but the bottom line must be the welfare of patients. I commend all those who are doing an excellent job in the health services and urge the Tánaiste to work with them in implementing the major reform and radical changes envisaged in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">I have welcomed the plans for vital investment in respite and day care services for persons with disabilities. However, if some €900 million is to be spent on both services and infrastructure projects, it is important that this allocation is monitored. We must look at the area of the management and utilisation of resources. Funding must not be wasted and must be seen to be delivering services effectively. It is unacceptable that adults with intellectual disabilities, such as people in their 40s and 50s with Down's syndrome whose parents are in their 80s, should be on residential waiting lists. I am glad we are waking up to the reality and that this situation will end soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">It is vital that we have an effective system for monitoring and measuring the expenditure of resources in the health service. A strong input from Oireachtas Members is essential. In this context, I strongly support amendments Nos. 11 and 18. Deputy Cowley, who has tabled the latter amendment, is an Independent Member with a significant interest in the health area. He also has direct experience of this issue. Deputy Cowley should be commended for his work in the Dáil in the past two and a half years on issues such as this. Amendment No. 18 should be considered seriously. I welcome and support amendments Nos. 11 and 18.</p>

          <p eId="para_794">I share many of the concerns expressed by Deputies on the issue of accountability and so on. That is why I have sought to bring forward amendments on foot of the debate on Committee Stage. Unfortunately, we have not reached those amendments yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Deputy Twomey raised queries on amendment No. 130, which is to insert the new section 79. He asked what the term "dealing in relation to a Member of either House of the Oireachtas" means. It means that a Member of the Oireachtas cannot inquire about anyone in his or her constituency. Members may make representations on behalf of people who have asked them, as elected public representatives, to do so. Being a Member of the Oireachtas does not entitle us to all information. Queries which relate to individuals must be made in a representative capacity. Regulations will clarify this matter further and provide for the issue of breaches of confidentiality. Confidentiality may not be an issue where a constituent asks a Member to represent him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The executive will be responsible for the delivery of health care to a large number of people. It will not be exclusively responsible. There will be other agencies.

          <p eId="para_799">In its initial phase, the national treatment purchase fund has dealt with surgical procedures. The budget for the fund has been increased by 50% for next year. I am looking forward to having discussions in the next two weeks with the chairperson and chief executive of the national treatment purchase fund regarding how those additional resources should be used. Many patients and others have raised the question of long out-patient waiting lists in some specialties. We need to examine ways of extending the remit of the fund, without taking away the focus of why it was established in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_804">I will make announcements shortly regarding waiting lists and so on. The position is very unsatisfactory in relation to that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The national treatment purchase fund was established by Government, almost as a universal insurer, to deal with the longest waiters, some of whom had been waiting years for essential treatment. Generally, it is working well although some issues need to be resolved. Most people would acknowledge that.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The Health Service Executive cannot be required to take policy direction from an Oireachtas committee. The Minister and the Department will remain responsible for policy under the new system. The HSE will be responsible for the delivery and implementation of policy and for management and administrative arrangements. Its relationship to the Department will be very much like that between the national health service and the Department of Health in the United Kingdom. The Minister is accountable for policy. Of course, Ministers take into account the views of Oireachtas committees across a range of areas, not only in health care, and that will remain the position. However, an administrative management body cannot be accountable to the Oireachtas for how and where it spends its money, to the Minister with regard to its overall responsibility and to an Oireachtas committee for policy. That would not be in the interest of the agency, the Oireachtas or anyone else. I want to have a clear focus on what is the role of the HSE. The Minister of the day can give it directions and seek policy advice from it because it will have an enormous resource of expertise. However, policy will remain a function of the Department of Health and Children, not of an agency of this kind, which will be an administrative management system for the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Deputy McGrath spoke about people suffering from disabilities and their parents, children, brothers and sisters. Many Deputies have that experience in our families. Many people bring to this process not only legislative or official advice but their personal experience. Very often, such personal experience can affect appropriate change more than can official responses. We should all be flexible in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The complaints procedure was referred to by Deputy Neville. It will apply to anything which does not involve a clinical judgment. The examples cited by Deputy Neville relate to administrative issues. When someone does not read something, that is an administrative error. Such matters would be the subject of the complaints procedure. An inspector will deal with the area of psychiatric illness. I understand that complaints can be brought to the attention of the inspector. I see Deputy Neville is nodding. I acknowledge that he has more expertise in this area than I do. With the exception of clinical judgment, which is and must remain the responsibility of the clinician, other matters which fall under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children or the general Ombudsman can be complained about. I hope they will be corrected in a local environment to the satisfaction of the vast majority of complainants.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">In its annual report, the executive will be required to give details of the nature of all complaints so that we will have an idea of the kind of complaints being made and how complainants have been satisfied. In this way we will ensure that whatever has been brought to light will not happen again or that the circumstances in which it happened will be minimised. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Deputy Twomey's amendments would mean the HSE could not engage in any project without consulting or informing the Joint Committee on Health and Children. That would place an unnecessary burden on the executive. Accountability provisions are provided for in many of the amendments I have brought forward and further accountability issues will be dealt with by way of regulations. This is a more satisfactory way to deal with some of the detail we discussed on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_811">Amendment No. 11 deals with the same subsection as the previous set of amendments and amendment No. 10, and relates to the voluntary and community sector. Regrettably, the Minister rejected those amendments. In this instance, I am trying to ensure that the executive takes full cognisance of the views of the Houses of the Oireachtas and their joint committees. Not only is that a very reasonable pursuit but a laudable one.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">The section states that in performing its functions the executive shall have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government or any Minister of the Government. My amendment seeks to add the words "or resolutions or reports adopted by the Oireachtas or by any of its joint committees" which would be relevant to the work of the executive. Given the configuration of the House and the make-up of its committees, once adopted it is most likely that this proposal would have the imprimatur of Government in any event. However, the amendment would allow for cases in these Houses and their committees where resolutions and reports are adopted in which we all have the opportunity to participate. Government, on the other hand, operates outside this House and at a different level. The amendment would ensure that the democratically elected and accountable representatives of our people would have an input and that the executive would have regard to that input. I will conclude with this point. I believe that——</p>

          <p eId="para_815">I thank the Tánaiste for her reply. Obviously, the interpretation of "clinical" is key. This term has been interpreted differently based on contacts I have had with health boards. While in certain circumstances a clinical decision has been seen as one of the clinician, the Tánaiste has now interpreted this as not being so. It is the decision of the clinician to identify the condition the person has and the treatment that should be carried out in those circumstances. If I am interpreting the Tánaiste correctly perhaps as much 80% of the clinician's work might be of an administrative nature. I give an example that I come across all too regularly. Families are often extremely concerned about a suicidal relative in a psychiatric hospital who is to be discharged and often make complaints. Is the discharge of such a patient a clinical or an administrative decision?</p>

However, some would say it was a vote of no confidence in the system that rather than investing in the system we would arrange for people to go to a private facility or abroad to have a procedure carried out. It fails to address the 100,000 people waiting to get on to a list.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">While I could envisage a committee taking a decision on a matter, it does not necessarily mean that the Minister of the day will adopt it as policy. Under our system policy is decided by the Government. It must clearly be endorsed if not voted on by this House. Clearly if the House has no confidence in the policy it will no longer remain as the policy. That is quite separate from requiring a Minister to take a direction on foot of a recommendation from a committee. It is generally the case that when dealing with a matter related to a constituency or a region, Deputies of every hue, including Government Deputies, will have a particular view. When the number of Members of the House is factored in, no decisions could be taken. It is the duty of Government to make choices, subject to it having the confidence of this House. I am not in a position to accept Deputy Cowley's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">In response to Deputy Neville's question, the Ombudsman has interpreted very widely issues concerning clinical judgment. Obviously it excludes what we would all broadly or normally regard as clinical judgment, the doctor's judgment of what is required. The administration surrounding that is clearly a separate issue and would fall under the remit of the complaints procedure in the legislation. I am advised that the discharge policy of psychiatric patients is the specific remit of the inspector of mental health services. If somebody wants to make a complaint about a psychiatrist who determines that a patient is fit to go home, that complaint should be dealt with by the competent authority, which is the inspector of mental health services. It is not possible to have an administrative complaints procedure to deal with such issues.</p>

She referred to the possibility that an Oireachtas committee, for example the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, might pass a resolution or adopt a report, which could run contrary to Government policy. We are not making it mandatory on the executive. We are trying to enshrine in the legislation that the executive should have regard to recommendations by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, which is not requesting too much. It is a very sane and sensible proposition. The executive should, of course, have regard to any resolution or reports adopted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and any report or resolution adopted by the Houses of the Oireachtas, just as Government should have regard to these matters. I reject the Tánaiste's rejection of the arguments for this worthwhile amendment, which will result in a deficient wording in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I will not speak at length on this amendment. It is essential that the executive be required to assist in every way in the answering of parliamentary questions. There is real concern across a whole range of opinion in this Hose that the establishment of this executive will lead to a further erosion of democratic accountability. These views are also held on the Government side of the House. While they will not say so inside the House, they have said so outside the House. Ultimately the Tánaiste is the Minister responsible for all matters pertaining to health and children. It is important, therefore, that we ensure it is clearly understood that the Minister's accountability to this House is reflected in the wording of the legislation. The Minister of the day must be answerable to the Dáil for health policy and the overarching management and delivery of health services and personal social services. Many times I have watched in great frustration the Minister's predecessors wash their hands when matters have come before them in the House. They said it was a matter for the health board or for this, that or the other. Will we now get the response that it is a matter for the executive? There will be no democratic accountability and our role in here will be absolutely undermined and frustrated in the key areas of health and children. If that is the case, it is outrageous.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The only way we can ensure there is parliamentary accountability is to insert this amendment into the legislation so it is patently clear to the executive that it has a responsibility to ensure that all parliamentary questions placed by Members of this House to the Minister are answered fully with all relevant detail. That is essential, otherwise the executive will become another quango, as have so many other offspring of the political system, with ministerial appointees but with no accountability to elected representatives here or people outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I hope the Tánaiste will recognise the importance of this amendment that guarantees accountability and that when we place parliamentary questions we have not only the right to expect full disclosure but that it is clearly understood by the executive that we get proper, detailed, informed replies. Otherwise, our role as representatives of our communities and constituencies will be undermined.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">The guillotining of this Bill is disgraceful. There are 151 amendments. Part 9 of the legislation dealing with patient complaints will not be reached because the amendments relating to it start at No. 100 and we will only deal with 30 amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Some of the amendments relate to accountability to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. This is a flawed approach because the committees have a Government majority and they can block or railroad change of it suits the Government. I experienced this in June in the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, when Government Deputies called a vote and blocked a discussion on our having a two week discussion of decentralisation a month after the local elections. We have also seen changes being railroaded. One of the first things I saw happen on the Committee on Finance and the Public Service was amendment of the Freedom of Information Act to reduce the accountability of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">These amendments, however, are different. They deal with parliamentary questions and how they are answered by the CEO and the board of the Health Service Executive, local authorities, statutory bodies and anyone who has a connection with the executive. To have these taken on board is important. The last time we discussed these amendments the Minister said regulations would follow but we have no idea what those regulations will be even though we will vote on this Bill in 15 minutes. The Minister should have taken these amendments on board and refused to guillotine this legislation because there is so much important debate still to take place. We have no idea what regulations the Minister will bring forward. I will only be able to discuss ten of my 50 amendments. Other Members will be equally disgusted that having done such hard work on preparing their amendments and having facilitated the Tánaiste on Committee Stage by calling no votes, she has come back on Report Stage without recognising our good faith and delivering legislation we could all support. We cannot support it because we still do not know what is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">A new amendment from the Minister for Health and Children was given to me at 4 p.m., 15 minutes ago. It is only a technical amendment but that is typical of what has happened with this legislation. Deputy Twomey is right, there was a great deal of goodwill towards the Bill and its handling because the Tánaiste was new in the post. Goodwill was extended and it is unfortunate the Tánaiste has not extended the same degree of courtesy to the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Most of us who have local experience of health boards are dismayed that the sections dealing with them are further on in the Bill. The health services will not be accountable at local level. No matter what anyone thinks of politicians, we are elected by the people and the voice of the people is the voice of God in a democracy. We are chosen to question but we have no mechanism for extracting the information necessary to ensure accountability. If there is nothing to hide why will the Tánaiste not accept the amendment? That concerns me.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Why is this Bill being amended so extensively, even by the Government? The list of amendments is frightening. The Bill was rushed and technicalities such as the use of "he", "she", "are", "may" and "shall" must be amended. The Minister should withdraw this Bill and take six months to consider her plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">We must be careful about welcoming the treatment purchase scheme. I agree with Deputy Cowley, it is an excellent scheme to address extensive waiting lists in particular specialities, but it is not the way the health service should go. We should build our own health service. It is an indictment that we must send people abroad to avail of services that other countries have put in place for their citizens. This may be the way the Tánaiste intends to privatise the entire service, by sending everyone abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">If this Bill is not hiding anything, we should debate it fully. We are talking about issues of accountability.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">I support amendment No. 12 because it is positive and constructive and adds to the Bill. There are Members on the other side who want this amendment. I spend a good deal of time speaking with backbenchers and they are supportive of this amendment. Sadly, I cannot see them supporting it because of the Whip's position.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The overall thrust of the amendment is about reform, change and improving services. I emphasise the issue of reform and accountability. It is essential when dealing with the issue of services that there is strong accountability. Given that some €30 million has been spent on reports in recent years I accept it is time to move on and allow the Minister get on with the job and deliver the services. At the same time our patients and citizens are demanding change and efficiency in the services. It is not acceptable, under any circumstance, that there are still patients on trolleys. This issue should be resolved by January or February because what we are talking about is the provision of approximately 300 beds. I urge the Minister to move rapidly. Everybody was open and flexible at the beginning of her term of office but it is time to move on and start delivering. I set a target date of January-February for the delivery of those beds for the frontline services and particularly the accident and emergency services.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Has the Minister looked at examples of good practice in accident and emergency services in other countries? Countries such as Sweden have experience in the area of medial community care. For example, Cuba has an excellent medical service despite being a poor country and has much to offer and has many new ideas. We should not be afraid to look at constructive ideas from around the world because of certain political baggage.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Amendment No. 12 deals with the question of openness, accountability and transparency which is an important part of the issue. I mentioned earlier the whole question of services for people with disabilities. I welcome John Dolan from the Disability Federation of Ireland who is in the Visitors Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Amendment No. 15 is relevant given that it deals with the voluntary and community sector. I avail of this opportunity to commend the disability groups which worked hard before the budget, lobbying Deputies and Ministers and which organised an effective campaign. I commend and thank them for their work because they had a major influence on Government policy. It is important to commend such groups as well as parents' groups as people were prepared to listen to them. Many of their ideas are coming to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">While amendment No. 12 may be about old-fashioned public service, a civil servant or a public servant working in the interests of the national good and the common good, sadly it is missing in today's society. I urge support for the amendment.</p>

When that plan was provided and submitted to the Department, the officials approved it and the amount spent in that health board was what was contained in the service plan. Where is the service plan now? Will 11 people sitting in their posh offices in Dublin know what is going on in any part of Cork or Kerry? They will not. There is no representation. The Minister speaks about local committees. The health advisory committees were abolished in the mid-1990s although they were effective.

          <p eId="para_851">This legislation is disgraceful. The promises made to introduce greater accountability on Report Stage have not been delivered on. I simply do not see them. If anything the Bill will encourage a culture of secrecy in the health service. I expect, a Cheann Comhairle, to receive many letters from you ruling questions out of order when I will be told the question does not apply but is a matter for the Health Service Executive. If we are lucky the chief executive officer will come before a Dáil committee, or some minion or other. I know the Tánaiste does not like these people to be referred to in those terms but I wanted and had tabled amendments, to make it mandatory for the chief executive officer to come before the Joint Committee on Health and Children on at least two occasions annually. It is not mandatory but is at the discretion of Dáil committees which, unfortunately, are controlled for the most part by the Government. We do not have the transparency that is required or the accountability but an erosion of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">We are told the patient will benefit. The patient cannot benefit from that type of secrecy and lack of accountability. We will see if it delivers on the accident and emergency crisis, the bed shortages and the real crisis at the heart of the health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">In regard to this legislation the Minister intends to say she did her best and she can hide behind the Health Service Executive when services are not delivered. The problems at the heart of the health service go back to some basic issues. One can speak about organisation and the health boards have been much maligned and criticised, but even Niamh Brennan did not ask for their abolition. There was some form of democratic representation but that pillar is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I regret the honeymoon is over. This is retrograde legislation. It is a sad day for democracy and this House. In years to come people will ask what the Government was thinking about when it rushed this Bill through.

The Tánaiste assured us there will be openness and transparency since she will be answering those questions. Like other Members, I am afraid that when we ask questions the response will be similar to those concerning the NRA, when we are told issues are not the responsibility of the Minister but of the NRA and that the Minister cannot interfere. I sincerely hope that will not be the case. In reply to the same question on Committee Stage, the Tánaiste said the Ceann Comhairle would rule on whether a question was in order.

        <b>Mr. O’Dowd</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
        his plans to change the retail planning guidelines; if he intends to allow for the building of a store (details supplied) in Ballymun or elsewhere; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_250">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_981">The retail planning guidelines prescribe a maximum gross retail floor space of 6,000 sq. m. for large-scale single retail warehouse development. This aspect of the guidelines has been under review for some time, and account is being taken of the need to ensure proper planning and sustainable development while also supporting effective competition in this sector of retailing in the context of ongoing developments in retail formats.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The retail sector is an important part of a modern and dynamic economy. Our rapidly growing economy is such that the demand for retail developments of various forms is growing substantially. It was never the intention of the retail planning guidelines to restrict competition or reduce the retail options available to consumers. In bringing the review of the guidelines to a conclusion, these issues, as well as all the relevant planning issues that concern this type of development generally, will be considered. I intend to make an announcement on the outcome of the review within the next few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">There is no question of the guidelines being changed to cater for a specific operator or case. Planning matters that may arise will be dealt with in the normal manner through the planning system. On individual applications, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority and, where appropriate, An Bord Pleanála, to consider all relevant planning issues in the course of determining any such applications in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_984">Does the Minister agree that while consumers would welcome IKEA's coming to Ballymun or another location, they have serious concerns? The members of the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, chaired by my colleague, and other Members of the Oireachtas are concerned about certain conditions that might apply to the location of the store in Ballymun. Serious problems arise in regard to the M50, other access routes and public transport but, nevertheless, IKEA's coming to Ballymun would be welcomed greatly, not least because of the 500 jobs that would be created. How will the Minister account for all the issues that have been raised by Members of the Oireachtas while at the same time proceeding with the principle he has enunciated?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_252" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_985">I am aware that consumers would very much welcome greater choice. The Deputy's views on IKEA are correct and they were corroborated today on a programme broadcast by RTE. I am aware that there are concerns regarding this matter, some of which are exaggerated. Problems associated with traffic, for example, will have to be remediated. I will table amendments for consideration that will address such issues. If we approach the matter properly and have the type of calm debate we had yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, the various circles involved can be squared.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">There has been widescale speculation on whether the store will locate in this State. If it locates in another part of this island, we will have lost an opportunity. I compliment Deputy O'Dowd, who discussed this matter at full length yesterday at the meeting of the joint committee, and I am aware of his concerns over the rights of consumers and people in general in Ballymun. He made his views very clear and they happen to coincide with mine.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_987">How will the Minister surmount the problem of changing the guidelines? He stated he cannot change them for just one company and therefore he is in a difficult position. Having read the press releases early in the week, I noted that there were obviously problems within Cabinet regarding this issue, just as there are problems in the Oireachtas. How can we be sure the Minister always receives the best independent advice on this matter? Will he confirm that the advice he receives is always truly independent? Does he believe he should appoint persons in the business community, such as representatives from Goodbody's, to re-examine this issue and take on board the needs and rights of the consumer primarily and also the needs of the different shopkeepers, especially those in small towns who fear they may lose many jobs because of developments such as that proposed? Can the Minister adjust the guidelines to do what the consumer wants and at the same time protect jobs in smaller towns and the regions?</p>

        <b>Mr. Gilmore</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
        if he intends to amend the legislation to provide for a national waiver system for those on low incomes who are unable to pay service charges without undue hardship, especially in view of the fact that one local authority is reported to have received legal advice that it is not entitled to provide a waiver scheme where such services have been privatised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [32876/04]

          </question>
          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_278" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_1014">The determination of the waste management charges is statutorily a matter for the relevant local authorities in cases where they are the service providers. Where, as may commonly occur, a private operator is the service provider, the operator determines the charges. Similarly, in regard to waiver schemes for waste charges, it is the responsibility of the local authorities concerned to decide on the nature and extent of any such scheme in the case of services it provides. Generally, waiver schemes do not operate in respect of privately supplied collection schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">Limerick City Council has received legal advice indicating that, in the circumstances obtaining in its area for the provision of domestic waste services, it may not be empowered to provide a waiver scheme. It is for the council to address this matter in the context of local circumstances and the possible measures available to it, of which there are several, under the Waste Management Acts. Given the possibility of alternative approaches under existing legislation and differing arrangements across local authorities, I do not consider it appropriate for amending legislation to prescribe a uniform approach to the design of waiver systems by individual local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">The issue of waste charges and people or households on low incomes has been raised in the context of the social partnership. Arising from this, discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs with a view to identifying relevant issues and how these might be addressed.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_279">
            <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_1017">Does the Minister think it is fair, when waste charges range from between €300 to approximately €500 per annum, that somebody receiving social welfare must pay between two and three weeks of his or her social welfare payment either to a local authority where there is no waiver scheme or to a private waste collector, which does not have a waiver scheme, to have the refuse collected? If he agrees that it is not fair what will he do about it? Some private collectors have no waivers, some have a waiver scheme funded by the local authority, which Limerick City Council has been told it may not continue. Some local authorities are contemplating dropping the waiver schemes they had. No other section of society would tolerate having to pay such a proportion of its income for refuse collection. These people cannot afford it.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_280" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_1018">I accept there is an emerging issue here whereby those on low incomes can or cannot avail of waiver systems in local authority service areas, as against households in privately serviced areas which cannot avail of the schemes. The social partners have brought this to my attention and it is part of the special initiative on waste management under sustaining progress. My Department is examining the matter with the Department of Social and Family Affairs with a view to examining the optimal and most effective arrangements to address the situation. I cannot be more forthcoming than that because those consultations and considerations are ongoing and have not reached a conclusion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">When will the Minister be in a position to bring proposals to the House on this? His predecessor instructed all local authorities and service providers to move to a pay by weight system from 1 January. If someone has not paid waste charges his or her bin will not be collected. It will be placed on the apparatus at the back of the truck, be brought up half way, stop, and be dropped. This cannot wait for interminable reports from the Ministers and prolonged consultation with the social partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">In the first week in January the bins of some pensioners and people on social welfare will not be tipped into the lorry because they have not paid their waste charges, or have not been granted a waiver. Will the Minister return urgently to the House with proposals on this before people on low incomes who cannot afford to pay these charges are arm-twisted into paying something they cannot afford or have their bin left behind, or be embarrassed in front of their neighbours, simply because they happen to be on low incomes?</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">The concept of waste charges is not entirely new and the most equitable way of charging and of meeting several principles is by charging according to use. The latest waste policy statement Taking Stock and Moving Forward refers specifically to this. A wide scale review of the matter is under way. I cannot tell Deputy Gilmore when the examination will be completed but I am aware of the urgency of the issue.</p>

        if, in regard to the proposed M3 motorway through the Tara-Skryne area, he has declared that he is seeking archaeological advice before making an informed decision on the matter; if he will seek the advice of independent experts who have an intimate knowledge of the archaeology and history of this area; and if he grants permission for this development through the Tara landscape, if he will, in consideration of the exceptional sensitivity of this landscape, insist that an independent archaeological authority oversees this work to ensure standards of best archaeological practice shall be observed at all times.

            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_1023">An Bord Pleanála, which has an independent statutory mandate, is responsible under the Roads Act 1993 for the approval of motorway schemes following an assessment of the environmental impact of the proposal. In the case of the M3 motorway, the process involved a detailed environmental impact assessment, in which archaeological considerations and other factors were extensively addressed, and a public oral hearing. Following this process, the motorway scheme, including the route of the proposed M3, was approved by An Bord Pleanála in August 2003. It is worth reminding ourselves of those facts, which are often overlooked in the debate. Under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004, once a motorway scheme has been approved, any associated archaeological works, for example, excavations, are to be carried out in accordance with the directions that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may issue following consultation with the National Museum of Ireland. That procedure is designed to ensure appropriate standards apply to the carrying out of archaeological work in connection with approved road developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">In the case of the M3 motorway, an application for the carrying out of a programme of archaeological works and mitigation measures regarding a portion of the route has been made by the roads authority to my Department and it is currently being considered. In determining the matter, I will receive expert advice from the archaeological staff in my Department. In accordance with the Act, I will also consult the director of the National Museum of Ireland before directions are issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">My Department has responsibility for the regulation of archaeological works and the maintenance of standards. All works carried out after directions given under the 2004 Act will be monitored by my Department to ensure they are carried out to the proper standards. Given that arrangement, I do not consider it necessary or desirable to establish a separate archaeological authority to oversee such works. Determination on the matters referred to above will be made as soon as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_284">
            <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1026">In approximately one month, the Minister will have to decide whether a motorway will slice through the archaeologically rich landscape of the Tara Skryne valley. Will the Minister will seek independent archaeological advice on the issue? I suggest to him that the archaeologists and academics attached to the discovery programme set up by the former Taoiseach Charlie Haughey over ten years ago is the most appropriate group, given the vast amount of knowledge they have accumulated regarding the rich archaeology of that part of Meath. Will the Minister consult the discovery programme, given its wealth of knowledge?</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">Perhaps I might point out to the Minister that there was an environmental impact statement for the route, which covered ten separate issues. However, the National Roads Authority went away and examined 18 different issues in arriving at the route that it selected. Among those 18 issues were traffic, the impact on road users and the impact on minor roads. In other words, there was a bias towards roads in those issues. Since this road may well be funded by a public private partnership, it is the most economic option to look for the quickest route between Navan and Dublin. Unfortunately, Tara lies directly on the desired line between those two points. Was Tara condemned from the outset simply by being close to the line between Navan and Dublin? I reiterate that the Minister must seek independent advice, and not simply from his own Department, since the archaeologists in Dúchas are now very much under his wing.</p>

            <p eId="para_1030">I am aware of the concerns of the Deputy and others. I also thank the Deputy for conducting the debate in a calmer fashion than some. The NRA, in developing road proposals, must take account of archaeology as well as other relevant factors, such as the engineering impact on homes, severance of farms, the natural environment, cost and so forth. I am not saying that Deputy Cuffe does not know this, but that seems to have been true of many people involved in the debate. The route that has been chosen is significantly further from the Hill of Tara than the existing N3 national primary road.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">Following the approval by An Bord Pleanála, archaeological test trenches were sunk along the route of the proposed motorway. I do not believe the Deputy meant to imply the archaeologists attached to my Department would modify their views accordingly. They will give an objective view on the issue, which I will consider. I too will examine it objectively. Some 38 sites have been identified along the 15 km route. That number is not at all out of line with other schemes. There are more than 120,000 known monuments and places of record on the island, and the development of a scheme the size of the M3 will inevitably result in discoveries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">I am conscious of the significance of this, and Deputy Cuffe is correct that the issue is not so much one of the archaeology in the ground but the general landscape. If one considers the legislation, one sees that my role in this is narrow, focusing on the archaeology of the scheme and issues relating to the mitigation of any works carried out. The route has already been decided. It has been through the planning process, and it is very much outside the power of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give directions on that. However, it is within my power to examine the archaeology, though I must be careful because I am operating in a quasi-judicial way, as the Deputy knows. I intend doing that in this and another case.</p>

            <p eId="para_1033">Does the Minister accept there is a view in the Department and among the archaeologists employed by the National Roads Authority that backs up the NRA in its decisions? I am worried that there is also such a view in Fianna Fáil. One might almost term it a Fianna Fáil-NRA view that believes in putting a road on the shortest route between two points rather than considering the other options. There is concern at the lack of geophysical imaging in the NRA report. Is the Minister concerned at that? The lack of such imaging is a little like going to a hospital and having a doctor poke one in the stomach instead of getting an X-ray.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_300" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_1046">The Government determined that the national spatial strategy should be informed by extensive consultations with organisations, groups and members of the public throughout the country. In June 2000, my Department accordingly invited 16 firms to tender for a consultancy contract to assist in devising and implementing the NSS communications campaign, including a range of marketing and advertising initiatives; to promote awareness and interest in the NSS; to disseminate information and identify and engage the target audience for the consultation process; and to support that process through organising consultation forums at regional level at various stages during the strategy's preparation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">In response to my Department's request for tenders, five were received, and three companies which submitted tenders were interviewed. The tender submitted by Drury Communications was selected on the basis that it best met the relevant selection criteria as set out in the request for tenders. On an hourly and monthly basis that tender was also the lowest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">A steering group, which included the person then appointed as the Department's communications co-ordinator, was established by the Department to oversee the work of the consultants. The consultants were required to work closely with and report regularly to the Department and to liaise on an ongoing basis with the then communications co-ordinator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">The contract with Drury Communications, originally of nine months' duration, contained an option for its extension for the period up to and including 31 December 2001, provided that the contractor's performance was satisfactory in all respects. The contract was extended for that period and subsequently, by agreement, on several occasions covering the period up to the end of December 2002, shortly after the NSS was published. The total amount paid to Drury Communications for the contract covering a period of two and half years was €383,556.85.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">During the run-up to the finalisation and launch of the NSS, it was decided that the communications campaign should be intensified considerably. Additional work was initiated on the presentation aspects of the strategy, media briefings, publicity and other briefing material. A communications consultant, who had been appointed in July 2002 under a more general contract to assist the Minister and the Department on strategic communications matters, participated actively in that work and attended related team meetings. That consultancy input was provided under the general terms of the contract involved and was not specifically procured regarding the NSS.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_1052">Deputy Allen tabled a question on 10 October 2002 on the number of consultants engaged on the national spatial strategy, the costs to date and so on. Leech Communications does not appear in the list given in the reply to that question. Why was that information given at that time when the information the Minister has given us now directly contradicts or adds to that information? Drury Communications had worked on this contract for more than two years and had met the interdepartmental steering committee dealing with the national spatial strategy. That is the only firm mentioned in the Department's minutes of 2 October 2002. Will the Minister confirm that is the position? Will he also confirm that the question of rolling out the spatial strategy was dealt with at that meeting and there was no mention of the new company to which the Minister referred?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_302" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_1053">The question focuses specifically on the contract awarded to Drury Communications. The other issues are outside the ambit of the question, but I will deal with them because it is important to do so. The issue of contracts with Leech Communications is outside the scope of the question. However, notwithstanding that, it is not unusual for a consultant co-ordinator to be involved in a Department. The issues and the amounts involved in this consultant's payment have been made a matter of record. The consultant in question has carried out good work for the Department. There has been no question about her professionalism. That is important to record. I met the consultant in question twice. I record that I was impressed by her professionalism, capacity and, in particular, her ability to render complex issues more easily accessible. The public service has many qualities, but having the best communications skills is not necessarily among its top qualities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">With regard to work carried out by the consultant in question — I know the Deputy would wish me to record this — she played a role in the national spatial strategy in addition to that played by Drury Communications, as I outlined in the reply. Leech Communications also provided support in a general sense on advice on procurement of creative media consultants, for example, in the case of the race and waste against campaign and on the roll-out of events. The company was also involved in issues relating to the Irish Presidency and in particular to the Environment Council of the Irish Presidency. I will not refer to other issues on the list, which is significant, as the Deputy might want to intervene. Ms Leech also provided support in a number of other campaigns, the details of which I can make available to the Deputy if he so wishes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1055">Why did the Department or the then Minister not list Leech Communications in the reply to the parliamentary question to which I referred? Will the Minister publish the documentation in regard to everything he has said to ensure there is transparency surrounding this matter? When the Minister, Deputy Cullen, appeared on an RTE programme this week, he specifically said that he needed a communications specialist given the scale of the challenge of the spatial strategy and the need to roll out the strategy. Given that Drury Communications was already employed doing that job, what sense did it make to bring in somebody new who knew nothing about the spatial strategy? Drury Communications had two years' experience of dealing with it, yet it was not asked to do this particular work. Given that Leech Communications was being paid €300,000 per year, would it not have been preferable for the then Minister to have appointed special political advisers as opposed to consultants? If he felt he had an issue in regard to his role as opposed to the Department's role, why did he not appoint political advisers who would have been far cheaper on the Government payroll and would have given better value to the taxpayer? He could have appointed six special advisers at €50,000 per annum. Why did he not do that?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1064">The Government has provided significant additional resources for housing in recent years. Record levels of funding are being allocated to local authorities for their social and affordable housing programmes for next year, with about €1.3 billion available from Exchequer resources for capital and current spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">Ensuring that we achieve maximum output for these resources and best value for money is a prime concern. Independent evaluation of the housing programmes at the mid-stage of the national development plan highlighted the fact that spending was 9% ahead of target and this was having a positive impact on addressing social inclusion. However, output has been behind that which has been forecast. Part of the reason for that is attributable to the rising costs of sites and construction inflation. Mobilisation of construction programmes by local authorities has proceeded at different speeds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">The important task is to ensure that best practice is highlighted and replicated. We need to focus the local government system on achieving the best performance possible on housing issues. This relates not only to providing the required quantum of housing, but achieving this on a timely basis with appropriate quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">One of the key issues arising from past performance is the need for certainty around funding and the value of a multi-annual approach. The €6 billion available for housing in the coming five-year period provides the certainty required. In association with this funding, my Department has initiated the development by local authorities of new five-year action plans for social and affordable housing to ensure a systematic and integrated approach to the effective use of these resources. I consider that with both funding and plans in place, real benefits will be seen in terms of the output and quality of social housing provision over the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1068">Does the Minister of State agree that at a time of a major social housing crisis throughout the State, the lack of delivery in terms of housing provision is causing misery for approximately 48,000 families? The houses promised are not being delivered. Does the Minister of State agree that apparently nobody is doing anything about this? Does he also agree that one local authority in the Dublin area delivered 52% of housing starts approved by the Department in the past ten years? I do not need to tell him about the housing crisis in this city.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">Who is to blame for this lack of delivery? Where is the blockage preventing these houses being built? If it is the case that local authorities are simply not building the houses, why is that the case? What are the obstacles to their doing so? It is not good enough for the Minister of State or the Minister, as he said last week, to point the finger at local authorities for not delivering these houses. What is the Minister of State specifically doing to ensure that houses approved by the Department will be delivered by local authorities? What is blocking 50% of house approvals proceeding in some cases?</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_313" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1070">Housing is one of the key responsibilities of local government. Funding is provided by the Department. It is of concern that approvals given have not in all cases been acted upon. Historically — the figures to which the Deputy refers cover a ten-year period — the local authority programme was managed on a yearly basis by allocating both starts and funding. Under the programme local authorities got funding on an annual basis in January or February. However, in recent years we have realised that the two most important ways of helping local authorities to do their job properly is by ensuring funding and adopting a multi-annual approach. They now know well in advance what their allocation will be. We completed one four-year multi-annual programme at the end of 2003 and we have started another. In the past, funding from year to year was not secure. Under the new system ongoing capital envelopes are secure. That means that over the next five years €6,000 million is in place. That will help local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">Price inflation and problems with builders and planning can occur anywhere. Under the four-year programme local authorities have advance notice regarding funding. That is why it is more helpful. Local authorities were allocated funding to carry out their plans. However, performance has been patchy. The best county achieved 130% of the plan while the worst achieved only 50%. Even in recent times I remember Members of this House who were also members of local authorities giving the Minister grief in the House because their authority had only achieved 50% of its plan. I often suggested that they should complain to the local authority. The Department can help by giving certainty of funding and compiling a long-term action plan covering four or five years into the future. It is up to the local authorities to deliver, and the Department is doing all it can to help them to do that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_314">
            <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_1072">I am pleased to hear the Minister say this is of concern. It is a matter of grave concern to a very considerable number of people outside this House. Unfortunately, the Minister did not say where the blockage is occurring. I accept that the multi-annual budget is of help. However, the Minister's senior colleague is blaming councillors for the hold-up. Does the Minister of State agree with the Minister on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">Multi-annual budgeting has been in operation for the past four years. Does that mean the problems of the past ten years happened during the first six years of that period and were rectified in the past four years? Where are the problems occurring?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1074">The information given out recently was intended to help councillors so that they would know the ranking of their council and be able to compare their position with that of other councils. Under the four-year multi-annual programme, Cavan was at the top of the list at 145% while other councils were at 50%. Problems involving inflation, contractors, prices and so on can arise at any time. Some local authorities have more ambitious plans and some authorities are more realistic. Some of the problems occur at local authority level. We are helping them to manage their affairs better. How one plans, sets down strategies and manages is of key importance. The Department is playing its part by providing long-term programmes and certainty of funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_1076">I welcome the contribution being made by Birdlife International and locally by BirdWatch Ireland to our understanding of the threats being faced by Europe's and Ireland's birdlife. A total of 43% of bird species in Europe and 31% of bird species in Ireland are recorded as under threat and these figures are clearly a matter of serious concern. On the other hand, some new bird species have recently started to breed in Ireland and other threatened ones have been recolonising their traditional sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">Changing land use and the intensification of agriculture are considered to be the main factors in the observed declines in many wild bird species. Populations of migratory birds that winter or breed in Ireland can be affected both by conditions in Ireland or elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">Legal protection for all species of birds is provided under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000. Open seasons and licences for the hunting of certain species are given only on the basis of sustainability and never in the case of threatened species.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The protection of habitats is also a key measure in the protection of our wild birds. Designation of special protection areas and special areas of conservation under the EU birds and habitats directives, respectively, enhances the protection of all birds, in particular those regarded as rare, vulnerable and endangered, including migratory species, and contributes to the maintenance of suitable habitats for wild birds in Ireland. The equivalent of 14% of the country's land area is covered by these designations and 110 SPA sites have been designated specifically for the protection of wild birds. I will shortly make the legal instruments designating a number of further special protection areas largely on uninhabited islands off the west coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">I also welcome the changes in EU support for farming, notably decoupling and a drive towards more ecologically aware farming practices under the rural environmental protection scheme, which provide incentives for a deintensification of farming that should benefit our wild bird populations. This combination of specific protection for species, the protection of important bird habitats, and changes in farming practice will bring about improvements to the environment and prospects for our resident and visiting species of birds.</p>

            <p eId="para_1081">That species of birds are under threat indicates what is happening to our environment and serves as a warning to us regarding global warming. I welcome the Minister's commitment to making progress on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">Does the Minister believe that, in terms of the Kyoto agreement and what we are doing about global warming and related issues, we need a new approach in Ireland, particularly in the context of polluting industries? Could we have a cross-party review in this House to discuss what we need to do regarding all these matters? What is happening to birds is but one indicator of environmental problems. There are many others. Global warming is the real threat, given recent weather patterns, storms, flooding and so on. It is a very serious indicator that things are really bad and we need to do much more. Perhaps this is something we can all do together.</p>

            <p eId="para_1083">National surveys have been and continue to be carried out using standard approaches and methodology. The protection afforded by the designation of the special protection areas, the natural heritage areas and the special areas of conservation will contribute to the maintenance of suitable habitats for wild birds. Together with the environmental benefits from improved practices under the rural environment protection scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food, that will represent a significant benefit for the protection of our birds. I re-emphasise that there are indications that other species of birds are now beginning to manifest themselves in Ireland that are becoming extinct in other countries. The basis of the Deputy's question does not, therefore, hold. However, there is much work to be done and we will continue with that. I hope the further designation I will announce in the near future will help.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1087">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 87 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">The rate of house price increase has generally declined in recent quarters and is now considerably lower than in the late 1990s. Increases in the June quarter of 2004 were generally lower than at any time since early 2002 and were much lower than in the June quarter of 2003. Most commentators predict that the trend in prices will increasingly moderate in the coming months and years. The likelihood of this is underpinned by the trend of housing output, with a further record level likely to be achieved this year and indications of a continued very high level of output in 2005 and subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">The Government will continue its strategy of promoting a high level of housing output to meet demand, achieving adequate output in all areas and pursuing a range of measures to assist affordability, particularly for first-time buyers. The affordable housing initiatives introduced by the Government are showing increasingly positive results and it is expected that up to 11,000 units will be provided between 2005 and 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">The stamp duty reductions announced in the budget will further assist affordability for first-time buyers with savings of up to approximately €12,000. This will help some first-time buyers to afford a starter home who might not otherwise be able to do so. It will help to open the second-hand market more to first-time buyers who had been increasingly deterred by the impact of stamp duty. The likelihood of causing increases in house prices is minimal in the context of high levels of housing output and because the reductions have been confined to the first-time buyer segment of the market. The reductions in stamp duty for second-hand houses should have a restraining effect on new house prices by removing distortion between the two categories and reducing the degree of concentration of first-time buyer demand on the new house market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">The indications for the coming year in regard to overall housing output, affordable housing and house price moderation are positive. The Government will ensure that effective policies continue to be applied and reviewed as necessary in the light of developments, with the overall aim of meeting the broad spectrum of housing need in the context of balanced and sustainable growth of the housing market.</p>

            <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_1092">The Minister referred to a range of measures to assist first-time buyers. What are the measures and will he itemise them? On budget day, the Minister of State may have heard an interview with an auctioneer who stated it was his belief that the adjustments to stamp duty on second-hand homes would have no effect on the price of housing. The auctioneer argued that the market value of properties would simply move upwards. Would the Minister challenge this assumption by a senior auctioneer? What is the Minister doing to bring down the price of houses? For example, when will the ninth progress report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which made firm recommendations, be brought forward? It is a document suggesting a range of measures which all agree would have significant impact on the price of houses, new and second-hand.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_321" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1093">I saw the interview with the auctioneer on budget day, which showed that there are many sides to this argument. He stated that the job of the auctioneer is to try to beef up the price to the maximum on behalf of the seller. Whatever about his belief, since then I have talked with some potential buyers in their late 20s and early 30s, and the perception of young potential first-time buyers is that the budget measure is very helpful and positive. I am sure the Deputy has also met some who appreciate it. They strongly believe it will be of benefit to them, which it will.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">The measure should take the pressure off the new house market because what happened in recent years, perhaps because of the burden of stamp duty, as people saw it, is that first-time buyers concentrated on the new house market and shied away from the second-hand market. This will help to rebalance the market to some extent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">With regard to the range of measures, there were previous reductions in stamp duty before last week's significant reduction, and changes were made to mortgage tax relief two budgets ago. Moreover, the Department now spends over €20 million per year on site subsidies, specifically geared at buyers in a particular income bracket. There is a range of measures to help people in specific income brackets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">On the Deputy's other point in regard to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, previous commitments were given that we would debate its report in the House when the National Economic and Social Council report was published. I hope the NESC report will be published soon after Christmas. The Goodbody report and the NESC report consider different aspects of the matter and we will have a debate on the overall issue in the new year.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_1097">I welcome the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers. Given the significant difference in house prices between Dublin and the rest of the country, does the Minister believe the ceiling of €317,000 will benefit fewer than would wish to gain from it? The average price of a house in Dublin is approximately €317,000 as we approach the end of the year. Therefore, the average first-time buyer in Dublin will pay stamp duty whereas the average first-time buyer outside Dublin will not. There is an inequality in this regard that could be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">Will the Minister consider introducing a special savings scheme for first-time buyers whereby, for example, for every €3 they would save, the State would contribute €1 over the same period as the present special savings incentive scheme. This is important to first-time buyers who contact me and there is significant interest in the implementation of measures specifically aimed at the young. However, we need to do more. What is the Minister's view on these issues?</p>

            <p eId="para_1099">I accept that prices in Dublin are higher than elsewhere. However, for good or ill, with regard to loan limits it has always been policy to treat the country as one and to maintain the same limits in all places. While I accept the average price of a house is as the Deputy stated, when the figures are trotted out each month by the Department or others in the business, the overall average house price is not necessarily the average price of a starter home. There is a significant difference between the two. These figures are repeatedly published but when I opened different affordable schemes in County Dublin in recent weeks-——</p>

Up to now, the State exclusively funded affordable homes. However, for some time we have tried to involve private enterprise in this. It is now happening and private enterprise will provide 97% loans, which will help. However, I accept the greatest problem for many young people is not getting the mortgage but getting the deposit. I do not want to show my age but in my time, young people were encouraged to save for this type of thing rather than blow €200 on a Friday night and the same again on a Saturday night. However, I accept the Deputy's point.</p>

In the affordable bracket under the 1999 scheme, prices range from €150,000, €170,000, €180,000 to €195,000. In my area and in places like that, prices are in that bracket.

It was very bad then, but it improved. Of course, it got worse again. However, for most people, the deposit is the problem. Most people can manage to pay their mortgage once they get it. People perceive the initial deposit and the stamp duty on secondhand houses as being the problem. The measures in last week's budget will certainly be of considerable help.</p>

The average price of a house in recent years has been increasing at an average of approximately 12%. Is the Minister of State saying that the average price of a house in 2005 will not increase by more than 12%? When he said house prices will moderate, by how much less than 12% does he expect them to rise? Given that the Government made a concession in the budget to demands from this side of the House on stamp duty, I find it unbelievable that it would not have modelled how that would play out in terms of house prices.

            <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1138">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 17 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">I understand the paper to which the questions referred was on eutrophication of inland and estuarine water and was delivered at an Environmental Protection Agency conference in November 2004. The author described the potential scenario of a build-up of phosphorus to a critical level over time in the soil of agricultural land due to the over-application of artificial fertiliser and manures. Where over-application takes place, the capacity of the soil to retain inputs of phosphorus may be exceeded leading to the loss of the excess phosphorus to receiving waters and the eutrophication of these waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">The paper did not claim that this scenario actually obtained at present or that there is a widespread, serious or immediate risk to Ireland's river water quality. Rather, while referring to this potentially serious situation, it highlighted conclusions of the EPA that Irish river water quality is among the best in Europe with two thirds of rivers unpolluted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">As part of the implementation of the EU water framework directive, my Department has been promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects. The directive requires us to maintain high quality water status and to restore polluted rivers and lakes to at least good status by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">The EU nitrates directive aims to protect waters against pollution from agricultural sources, including both nitrates and phosphates, with a primary emphasis on better management of livestock manure and other fertilisers. Ireland's national action programme under the nitrates directive was submitted to the European Commission on 22 October last. The action programme provides for a range of necessary measures to strengthen the application of good agricultural practice countrywide to protect water quality from pollution from agricultural sources. I understand that the Commission will formally respond to Ireland on this matter in the coming weeks.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_1143">The EPA conference document stated that one third of all rivers are now polluted and there is a danger that the crisis could spiral out of control unless urgent measures are taken. There is a serious problem, therefore, and notwithstanding what the Minister of State has said, we need to do more about it. The Minister, Deputy Roche, appeared on a recent television programme which was very informative and raised the serious issue of leechate from dumps getting into the water supply. I do not wish to be confrontational about this but my question concerned the EPA's office of environmental enforcement. I appreciate that the agency is an independent, stand-alone body with rights and obligations. When the EPA identified problems and issued directions against two local authorities, one in Wicklow and the other in Kildare, the Minister refused to intervene saying he has no role in the matter. The Minister has a role, however, and he should be much more proactive. Local authorities are there to police environmental legislation and control those who are illegally dumping and polluting the environment, including rivers, so the Minister must act. He cannot sit back in the comfort zone of the Custom House and pretend this is not happening, because it is.</p>

            <p eId="para_1144">There are two questions to respond to here. I want to be absolutely fair to Mr. McGarrigle. His paper emphasised that Irish rivers are generally of better quality than those of most other European countries. He took issue with the article as it appeared.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The Deputy also mentioned that my Department has put in place funding for enforcement by the EPA. Polluters must be brought before the courts. That is the Department's view and I expect that the EPA, which is independent, will apply the law as it is laid down.</p>

Some local authorities have been found not to be obeying the instructions of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should be dealing with any local authority against which EPA directives are issued. If they are not doing their job, county managers should be told to manage the environment properly, which is what they are supposed to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_1147">The EPA is taking action against local authorities that are not complying with environmental policy.

In addition, those rivers and lakes which were previously regarded as being slightly polluted are now becoming moderately polluted. That does not seem to square with what the Minister has told the House.</p>

The paper observed that half of all septic tanks are not functioning properly. Does the Minister of State or his Department know anything about that? It seems to be an extraordinarily high level of malfunction for septic tanks. Does the Minister of State have a comment or observation to make about that?</p>

            <from>Mr. Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_1163">The annual report of An Bord Pleanála 2003 was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 23 November 2004 and published. Copies are available in the Oireachtas Library. The report is very positive and shows that the board's performance on decision times, planning appeals and major local authority projects continues to improve significantly, notwithstanding an increase in the board's workload, which is up 4% in 2003 compared to 2002. The board met the statutory objective timeframe of 18 weeks for making a decision on a case in 74% of cases in 2003. This has increased to 82% in the first three quarters of 2004. The average time taken to dispose of cases has been reduced from 16 to 14 weeks to date in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">This substantial improvement in performance was due largely to the board clearing the backlog of cases that had built up over a number of years. The board and its staff achieved this by a steady improvement in their productivity and efficiency, including the use of fee-per-case inspectors and outside consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">The report shows that in 2003 the percentage of local authority planning decisions appealed continues to be about 7% of the total number of planning applications made. The number of local authority planning decisions reversed by the board was 30%, compared to 33% in 2002. First party appeals against refusal resulted in grants of permission in 22% of cases compared to 20% in 2002, while third party appeals against grants of permission resulted in 41% of refusals compared to 45% in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">Under the Planning and Development Act 2000 a number of functions previously exercised by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, such as the determination of compulsory purchase notices, certification of local authority projects requiring environmental impact assessment, and motorway and other road schemes, became the responsibility of the board. Timely decision making on these schemes is critical to the delivery of the national development plan and future infrastructural development. The board received 97 such cases during the year and disposed of 92.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">An Bord Pleanála provides a service that is critical for the development of the State, through the decisions it takes on major local authority infrastructure projects and its independent adjudication on planning appeals and related cases. To ensure the board can continue to deliver on its statutory objective to determine cases within 18 weeks, I will make additional financial resources available to it in the coming year. A significant portion of this will go towards the improvement of the board's information and communication technology capabilities. The additional resources will ensure the board can continue to offer an effective and timely service to all participants in the planning process. My Department will continue to monitor closely the board's performance in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">I recently met senior officials from the board and was impressed by their dedication and the effort they have expended in clearing the then unacceptable backlog that was criticised on all sides of this House. Their level of efficiency and application is to be commended.</p>

            <p eId="para_1169">I welcome the improvement in the output of An Bord Pleanála and the reduction in waiting times. What is the Minister's response to the comments made by the chairman of the board in the report, in which he seems to seek Government direction or new departmental guidelines in respect of three areas? The first of these is what he described as the poor quality of design evident in some housing developments. His second criticism related to the incidence of inappropriate 1970s-style suburban developments around many villages. Third, he criticised the poor quality of some section 50 student accommodation developments, in regard to which he observed that the relevant departmental guidelines relate only to space and that there is a problem with quality. Will the Minister consider those guidelines and perhaps revise departmental guidelines with a view to improving quality of design and addressing the issue of inappropriate development around villages and the quality issue in respect of section 50 developments?</p>

            <p eId="para_1170">As I have said, I am impressed by the chairman, the work of the board and the contents of the report. I will be conscious of the points made by Deputy Gilmore. He is correct in that the chairman drew attention at the launch of the report to poor design standards in many of the suburban estates around towns and villages, particularly in regard to living environments for occupants. I agree with the board that developers should be required to ensure high standards and will be calling on local authorities to pay attention to these design issues. I will consider all aspects of the report, including those to which the Deputy has referred in his comments on section 50 developments. I am aware of some criticisms that have existed for some time in that regard.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_380">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_1174">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue once again on the Adjournment. There has been a lack of clarity in regard to the continuation of TB and respiratory facilities at Peamount Hospital in Newcastle, County Dublin, for more than 12 months. The original rumour that these facilities were to be closed was denied. Subsequent to that, there was further rumour as to what might happen. Recently, all patients suffering from applicable illnesses were refused admission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">One patient suffering with a virulent infection was turned away and sent back to another hospital in Dublin from which he had been referred. This precipitated a crisis because the isolation facilities required were at Peamount Hospital and the welfare of other patients in the second hospital in terms of susceptibility to infection was in question. As a consequence, the patient had to be brought back to Peamount Hospital. It then transpired that, despite all the planning and machinations that had taken place and the grand ideas that were in place beforehand, nothing had been done in terms of planning for the treatment of TB and respiratory patients in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">I have found in recent times that it would be easier to get information from the Kremlin than to get replies to parliamentary questions on health issues. The response to almost every such question is that the issue in question is a matter for the relevant health board and that the Minister has referred the Deputy's question to the chief executive officer. One might be lucky to receive a reply three months later. By that time, however, any self-respecting patient about whose welfare one is inquiring could have sought help and succour elsewhere. He or she would not want to be waiting for a response to a parliamentary question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">This is not a reflection on the system in this House but on the quango system in regard to the health service, whereby accountability to the House no longer matters. In recent times, however, the powers that be were able to find extra beds in Peamount Hospital to alleviate the step-down facilities required at other hospitals in the city. Now it seems that TB and respiratory facilities will be scaled down. I eventually received a reply to a parliamentary question on this issue to the effect that a new consultant would be appointed for this service. I do not know where that consultant will be located.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">Peamount Hospital is ideally suited to dealing with infectious diseases, has the required isolation facilities, has operated to a wide catchment area in the past and regularly brings in patients from the catchment area for ongoing treatment. I have noticed in recent times that patients have been discharged as if they have undergone a miraculous cure. Am I to understand there will be no need for the facilities previously in operation in the hospital? Peamount Hospital was the best place to provide those facilities. It was accessible and had the necessary facilities in place. When push came to shove, it was proven to be the most suitable location to which to refer patients in need of this type of treatment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1184">I am glad the Deputy has raised the situation of a hospital with which we are both familiar. Services at Peamount Hospital are provided under an arrangement with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The background to the future organisation and delivery of respiratory and tuberculosis services can be found in a report of a review carried out by Comhairle na nOspidéal, published in July 2000, on respiratory medicine. While recognising the valuable role which Peamount Hospital had played for many years in the delivery of respiratory services, Comhairle did not regard it as an appropriate location for the future treatment of TB patients, especially those requiring ventilation and specialised treatment for other symptoms, such as heart disease or HIV.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">In addition to the advice from Comhairle on this issue, the board of Peamount Hospital has developed a strategic plan for the development of services. It employed external support to assist in this process and advise of developments in the wider health care environment. The strategy adopted by the board proposes considerable enhancement of existing services and the development of new services in the areas of rehabilitation and continuing care for older people, persons with intellectual disabilities and adults with neurological or pulmonary illness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">The authority and Peamount have established an implementation group to develop a transitional plan for the hospital and to address the wider issues of the management of TB services within the region. The group consists of a respiratory physician, a specialist nurse and director of nursing from Peamount, a management representative from Peamount, a public health specialist and an acute hospital accident and emergency representative. The group has clear terms of reference that will address the key issues in relation to future service delivery. This group is due to finalise its recommendations later this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">Services in the hospital, such as phlebotomy and X-ray, will continue to be available to the local community and indeed much of the discussion to date has related to how Peamount can more effectively meet the primary care needs of the local population. After discussion with local GPs, it is clear that key concerns have arisen in relation to the management of older people with chest infections and respiratory difficulties. The implementation group will also examine how these services will be maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">As the services in Peamount Hospital are of particular concern to the local GP community, the authority intends actively to involve them in defining the parameters of a new service to ensure that it can effectively meet the needs of the locality. Existing day and residential services for older people, people with intellectual and physical disabilities, continue to be provided at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">Following the withdrawal of services by a senior clinician, Peamount and Tallaght hospitals jointly applied to Comhairle na nOspidéal to restructure the post of a consultant respiratory physician based at Tallaght hospital. It was proposed that this physician would provide two sessions at Peamount Hospital, to ensure continuity of care. Following a meeting with the relevant hospitals and the ERHA, and after consideration at its meeting on 17 November 2004, Comhairle na nOspidéal agreed in principle, subject to formal confirmation by the parties, to restructure two permanent posts of consultant respiratory physician, one based at Tallaght hospital and one based at St. James's Hospital, to provide two sessions each at Peamount Hospital for an interim period of up to one year.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_1195">This is the second debate I have had on this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith. A recent case which was heard in the High Court for nine weeks has been settled between the Department of Agriculture and Food and Irish Edible Oils. Millions of euro were spent on this court case and it caused serious concern among the public, particularly readers of the <i>Drogheda Independent</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">In the course of the court case it was claimed that the pipe used for the discharge of risk material was also used, at other times, for washing out oils which were not specified risk materials. What risk, if any, does this present to the people who use the product made by Irish Edible Oils?</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">I have met the Food Safety Authority. Like me, the authority is strongly of the view that the Minister for Agriculture and Food must immediately commission an independent report to establish the impact, if any, of the occurrence alleged in court. I stress that the allegation has not been proved and I accept that. Nevertheless, risk assessment needs to be done to see how the health of the population might be affected by what is alleged to have happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">That is the core of the issue. Will the Minister carry out that assessment immediately? I understand it would cost in the region of €40,000, which is nothing compared with the cost of the recent court case, which amounted to millions of euro. Such an assessment could be concluded quickly, effectively and efficiently by a company which has already done much of the work.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_390">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. B. Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1199">My Department and two other defendants were sued in the High Court by a company in Drogheda, which had been contracted by one of the defendants, but not my Department, to store tallow derived from specified risk material, SRM. I do not propose to comment on the specifics of the case, other than to say that my Department and the other defendants have reached a settlement with the plaintiff without admission of liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">From February 1997, Ireland, as part of its national BSE control measures, introduced arrangements for the removal and destruction of SRM. Part of this system was the designation of a specific rendering plant to process this material. The resultant SRM meat and bonemeal and tallow was to be sent out of the country for incineration. Prior to sending the tallow abroad it became necessary to store it. Storage was arranged by a representative of the rendering plant at the premises of the plaintiff company under the supervision of my Department's veterinary inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">The specific allegation referred to by the Deputy is based on a statement made in the course of the case by a former employee of the company. However, a report prepared by the former managing director of the plaintiff company on the possible cross-contamination of edible product by the tallow derived from SRM was submitted to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on 28 April 2003. This report states: "separate hoses were used from May 1997, to pump product delivered by monery into the crude oil tanks." It further states: "only SRM product was pumped through the line dedicated to monery and there is no possibility of cross contamination between the two products through the product lines".</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">The reference to two product lines in the report furnished by the plaintiff company is to edible and non-edible product lines. These statements from the plaintiff company clearly rule out the possibility of such contamination as alleged to the court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">Nevertheless, my Department has had an assessment of potential BSE risk from this SRM tallow carried out by an internationally recognised risk assessment expert. That report represents an independent assessment of the level of BSE infectivity that might be present in this tallow, taking account of the material from which it was produced and the rendering process used.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">It has never been demonstrated that tallow is a cause of BSE and the conclusions of this risk assessment are, as a worst case scenario, that a bovine would have to consume a tonne of this tallow to receive an infective dosage. For a human, the risk potential would be significantly reduced, due to the cattle to human species barrier that would reduce the effective exposure by a factor of 1,000 or more. On the basis of these figures the alleged contamination of tallow used in the human food chain is likely to present no more than a minuscule risk to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">I wish, however, to make some general comments on tallow and health risks which might or might not be associated with it. Tallow is a by-product of the meat slaughter industry. The rendering of animal by-products, including tallow, takes place in nine rendering plants in the State. These are all approved and supervised by my Department under EU legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">The standards applied are set in line with best EU practice, which itself is based on latest scientific knowledge. The overarching European Union BSE controls, including the rendering process criteria and the approved disposal methods for animal by-products, are regularly reviewed by the EU scientific steering committee. This committee, which is the main advisory body to the European Commission on BSE, regularly reports to the Union institutions on developments in this area. The EU Food and Veterinary Office also audits on an ongoing basis the implementation of EU legislation by member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">The rendering process prescribed in EU legislation is essentially a series of moisture and fat reduction steps, which transform the by-products into meat and bonemeal, and tallow. Meat and bonemeal is a solid dry substance, whereas tallow is an oil. The storage, handling, transport and export for destruction of these products are also regulated by my Department in line with EU legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">The role of meat and bonemeal in the development of BSE in animals is well established. It is now accepted that the vast majority of BSE cases have been caused by the consumption by cattle of contaminated animal feed. Any health risks associated with animal by-products, including tallow, are the subject of regular consultation between my Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. I stress that these products do not go into the human or animal food chains and are disposed of by incineration or co-incineration abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">As has been stated before in a debate on this issue, numerous inaccurate statements have been made about BSE in recent times. Clearly, the best approach to dealing with a subject such as BSE is to concentrate on what is known to be sound and agreed scientific fact. The points I have outlined are in this vein and I hope that on the basis of the facts outlined, including those related to a formal risk assessment, I have put the Deputy's mind at ease.</p>

            <p eId="para_1213">I assume the questions refer to general purpose grant allocations from the local government fund for 2005. Earlier this week I notified all local authorities of their general purpose allocations, which will total €817 million for 2005. This represents an increase of 8.7% on average over the corresponding allocations for last year and is well ahead of the current rate of inflation. The 2005 allocations consist of a 7% increase across the board on the amount provided to each authority in 2004 and also an element for equalisation. Overall, the allocations represent an increase of well over twice the 1997 allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">In determining allocations for 2005, I had regard to the level of funding available to me for this purpose, the extra demands that different local authorities will have to meet in the year ahead and the capacity of authorities to generate income from local sources. I was also conscious of the need to provide extra financial assistance to financially weaker authorities. In this regard, €12 million was provided for equalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">I am satisfied that the general purpose allocations provide an appropriate contribution to meeting the increased costs faced by local authorities in 2005 and will allow them to frame reasonable balanced budgets without undue increases in local charges.</p>

            <p eId="para_1219">The better local government modernisation programme has brought significant benefits to local government. These include constitutional recognition and guaranteed local elections; enhanced levels of funding; strengthened political and management structures; an updated legal framework as well as an efficiency agenda focused on improved corporate planning, IT, human resources and customer service. Updated financial management systems, facilitating better financial management and planning, have also been introduced and a new initiative to improve service standards with an extended range of performance indicators was launched this year. A major independent study to identify future funding requirements and options for local government is underway and will be completed by spring 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">Local government modernisation provides an enhanced role for elected members in policy formulation and review and in developing an integrated strategy for the economic, social and cultural development of their areas. This is undertaken in partnership with representatives of the sectoral interests through the establishment of strategic policy committees, SPCs, and the county/city development boards respectively. The role of the locally elected representative has been further strengthened under the modernisation programme by the creation of a single mandate for councillors from the recent local elections and also by the improved financial support framework and better training and information opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">Quality customer service is a key pillar of the modernisation programme. All the various elements of the programme are centred around this objective. Substantial resources have been provided by my Department to local authorities for specific initiatives to improve service provision. These include €31 million in support for a one stop shop programme and €9.8 million to improve efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery through the use of technology. In addition, local authorities are obliged from 2004 onwards publicly to report their performance against 42 service indicators across their principal functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">It is my aim, over the lifetime of the Government, to intensify and consolidate the gains being made through the modernisation programme and, in particular, to promote improvements in performance and in service delivery by local authorities to their communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1232">An Bord Pleanála, which has an independent statutory mandate, is responsible under the Roads Act 1993 for the approval of motorway schemes following an assessment of the environmental impact of the proposal. In the case of the M3 motorway, the process involved a detailed environmental impact assessment, in which archaeological considerations and other factors were extensively addressed, and a public oral hearing. Following this process, the motorway scheme, including the route of the proposed M3, was approved by An Bord Pleanála in August 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">Under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004, once a motorway scheme has been approved, any associated archaeological works, for example, excavations, are to be carried out in accordance with directions that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may issue, following consultation with the National Museum of Ireland. This procedure is designed to ensure that appropriate standards apply to the carrying out of archaeological works in connection with approved road developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">In the case of the M3 motorway, an application for the carrying out of a programme of archaeological works and mitigation measures relating to a portion of the route has been made by the road authority to my Department and is at present being considered. In determining the matter, I will also receive expert advice from the archaeological staff of my Department and I will also, in accordance with the Act, consult with the director of the National Museum of Ireland before directions are issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">My Department has responsibility for the regulation of archaeological works and the maintenance of standards. All works carried out under directions given under the 2004 Act would be monitored by my Department to ensure they are carried out to the proper standards. Given this arrangement, I do not consider it necessary or desirable to establish a separate archaeological authority to oversee such works. Determination of the matters referred to above will be made as soon as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_397">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1239">I assume the question refers to the report entitled "Ireland's Environment — Common Sense not Catastrophe", which has been published by Friends of the Earth Ireland. This report followed and drew from the statutory EPA state of the environment report, Ireland's Environment 2004, published last April.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">The EPA report concluded that "although under increasing pressure, Ireland's environment remains of generally good quality and represents one of our most essential assets." Nonetheless, it emphasises that international commitments on air emissions, eutrophication prevention and control and waste management present Ireland with important environmental challenges and priorities for action. Broadly similar concerns are expressed in the report by Friends of the Earth Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">With regard to air emissions, work is continuing on our international commitments. EPA outlined among the positive signals for the environment a recent reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases. These were down from 31% above 1990 levels in 2001 to 29% in 2002, the first reduction in a decade. Preliminary figures for 2003 show a further reduction to 24.7% above 1990 levels. These figures indicate that significant progress is being made towards achieving our target of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels during the Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">Eutrophication is the single most important problem affecting surface waters in Ireland. However, water quality in Ireland is generally satisfactory. The EPA report, Water Quality in Ireland, which applies to the period 1998 to 2000, indicates, for the first time since national surveys commenced in 1971, a reversal in the downward trend in water quality, with a reported increase in the length of unpolluted river channel from 67% in the 1995 to 1997 period to 70% in 1998-2000. In addition, lake surface area classified as unpolluted has increased from 65% to 93% over the same periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">As part of the implementation of the water framework directive, 2000/60/EC, my Department is promoting, and funding at a rate of100%, the establishment by local authorities of inter-authority river basin management projects to develop river basin monitoring and management systems and to provide the bulk of the baseline data required to implement the directive and to develop river basin management plans. These projects will identify all significant impacts on water quality and quantity, set quality objectives and identify and put in place the necessary monitoring and management measures to achieve those objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">We have also seen significant progress in the modernisation of waste management practices and infrastructure. In particular, rapid strides have been made in recycling, with targets for recycling of packaging, construction and demolition waste being exceeded. Government policy on waste management is set out in the policy documents Changing our Ways — 1998; Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change — 2002; and Taking Stock and Moving Forward — 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The Government's approach is based on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy of prevention/minimisation, significantly increased levels of recycling, energy recovery and, finally, utilising landfill as the last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered. Local authorities have adopted waste management plans which, informed by the performance targets set out in these policy statements, call for the provision of modern integrated waste management services and infrastructure. The implementation of these plans is a matter for the relevant local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">While this progress is encouraging, we must continue to work towards improvements in the areas of concern specified in both the EPA report and the publication by Friends of the Earth Ireland. Significant challenges remain and these will continue to be addressed in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1272">The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has always advised householders, particularly those living in high radon areas, to have their homes measured for radon and, where necessary, has also advised householders to have remediation works carried out. Over the years, the Government, through the RPII, has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon. During the years 1992 to 1999, the RPII carried out a national survey of radon in domestic dwellings aimed at assessing the extent of the radon problem in homes. The survey involved the measurement by the RPII of radon for a twelve month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km x 10 km grid square throughout the country. The RPII's website, <i>www.rpii.ie</i>, contains a comprehensive map of the high radon areas in Ireland as well as the report of its national survey of radon in homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">Upgraded building regulations, introduced in June 1997, require all new houses which commenced construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures. My Department has recently published an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C, TGD-D, on Part C of the building regulations, site preparation and resistance to moisture, incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon protection measures are carried out more effectively. With regard to pre-1997 houses, my Department published a booklet in February 2002, entitled "Radon in Existing Buildings — Corrective Options", advising designers, builders and home owners on remediation options for reducing radon in existing houses to, or below, the national reference level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">Epidemiology studies have shown that naturally occurring radon gas concentrations add to the incidence of lung cancer. While this evidence is derived primarily from studies of miners exposed to radon gas at work, it is supported by the outcome of a number of studies of radon exposure in the home. It has been established that approximately 10% to 15% of all lung cancer deaths in Ireland are linked to radon gas exposure and that the incidence is higher in smokers than non-smokers. It is important, however, to emphasise that it is not possible to ascribe any individual lung cancer case to exposure to radon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">In recent months, the RPII has undertaken several initiatives to further heighten awareness of the radon issue in Ireland. In November 2004, the RPII hosted the third national radon forum in Dublin to raise awareness of radon as a health risk. Earlier this year the RPII published a revised version of its booklet "Radon in Homes". The RPII also plans to distribute an information poster on radon for display in libraries, medical centres and so forth advising people to have their homes checked for radon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">Both the RPII and my Department will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of radon and to encourage householders with radon concentrations above the national reference level to undertake remediation works.</p>

            <p eId="para_1278">The Planning and Development Act 2000, which was based on a widespread consultation process, represented the most far reaching reform of the planning system since the original 1963 Act. The Act revised, extended and consolidated the legislative basis for the Irish planning system. There are no current plans for wide scale amendment of primary planning legislation, although this is kept under review in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">However, my Department is currently considering submissions received on draft regulations which will amend the Planning and Development Regulations 2001. These regulations contain proposals to further streamline the planning application process. In particular, a standard planning application form is proposed for use by all planning authorities. The draft regulations are available on my Department's website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">My Department has also been examining legislation on development consent for major projects to ensure that we have the best possible system for the timely and cost effective delivery of infrastructure. Having examined the problems that have arisen in the area, it is considered that legislation is desirable to address some issues arising in the approval process. In general terms, it is intended in this proposed legislation to reduce the time required for obtaining development consent for necessary major public projects and to co-ordinate and streamline the different procedures now involved, while respecting the requirements of environment and heritage protection and the need for adequate public consultation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1282">I notified local authorities earlier this week of their general purpose grant allocations for 2005 from the local government fund. The allocation for Waterford County Council is €18,889,048. This represents an increase of 7.65% over the corresponding allocation for 2004 and is well ahead of the current rate of inflation. Year on year comparisons show that the council has received an increase of 145% in such grants since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">General purpose grants are a contribution to bridge the gap between the expenditure incurred by local authorities in their day to day operations and the income they can generate locally from commercial rates, local authority housing rents, other charges for goods and services and funding from specific State grants. I am satisfied that the general purpose allocation for Waterford County Council provides an appropriate contribution to the increased costs faced by the council in 2005 and that it will enable the council to frame a balanced and reasonable budget for the coming year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1299">On foot of the success of the environmental levy on plastic bags, which was introduced in March 2002 and has resulted in a reduction in the dispensing of plastic shopping bags at retail outlets by over 90%, the An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to consider the extension of the levy on plastic bags to other materials which may be problematic from a waste management and/or litter perspective. The litter monitoring body, which is co-ordinated by my Department, has published two reports to date — in respect of the years 2002 and 2003 — which provide valuable statistical data on litter pollution in Ireland. In the light of the first litter monitoring body report published in July 2003, in respect of the year 2002, my predecessor announced his intention to tackle the issue of litter caused by chewing gum, fast food packaging and automated teller machine, ATM, receipts, which were identified as significant elements of litter pollution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">To this end, a consultancy study was commissioned in September 2003 to carry out an analysis and recommend appropriate economic instruments, including environmental levies, that might be implemented to tackle the litter problems caused by these items. The consultancy report was released for public consultation on 23 September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">With regard to chewing gum, the consultants' report proposed two options — a mandatory 10% levy on chewing gum sales, an average 5 cent per pack, to be collected at manufacturer, importer or distributor level, which would generate an estimated €4-5 million per annum for use in paying towards the clean up costs of chewing gum litter; a negotiated agreement between my Department and the industry involving the putting in place of a comprehensive action plan incorporating intensive education and awareness campaigns and including agreed funding levels with agreed tangible targets and time frames aimed at changing consumer behaviour with chewing gum disposal and reducing gum litter. The consultancy report also recommended negotiated agreements with the relevant sectors regarding fast food packaging and ATM receipts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">The purpose of the public consultation process was to obtain the views of relevant stakeholders and other interested parties on the report's recommendations. The deadline for the receipt of comments and submissions under the public consultation phase was 29 October 2004. It is intended that a final decision will be made on this matter as soon as possible on foot of evaluating the submissions received, including the submission from IBAL, during the public consultation process.</p>

        the progress made by his Department, in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland, in the investigation into illegal cross-Border dumping; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [32674/04]

          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_414">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1346">Tackling illegal cross-Border dumping is a key priority in the overall intensification of enforcement against illegal waste activity and one which is being pursued vigorously. I am satisfied that effective co-operation is being developed between the respective authorities in dealing with illegal cross-Border movements of waste. While enforcement is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, I will continue to ensure that the regulatory framework and the resources available are appropriate to deal with the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">Significant powers are available to local authorities under the Waste Management Act 1996 to enable them to tackle illegal waste activity and they were further strengthened by the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. These include powers, for example, to halt vehicles, inspect premises and examine records, which are of central importance in dealing with the smuggling of waste. Maximum penalties attaching to illegal waste activities are also substantial —€15 million and/or a ten year jail sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">To further assist local authorities in acting on these powers, over €7 million has been allocated from the environment fund to support a more vigorous approach to environmental enforcement, with a particular emphasis on combating dumping and other unauthorised waste activities. This is now being reflected in the presence of additional enforcement personnel on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">I have met with the director general of the Environmental Protection Agency, within which the OEE is located, and have stressed the importance I attach to its work. The office is well placed to mobilise a co-ordinated national response across all local authorities to this national priority. Those involved in environmental crime do not respect local authority boundaries or, indeed, national frontiers and our response to them must be as comprehensive and sophisticated as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">A major study has been commissioned by the OEE to establish and document the extent of unauthorised waste activities in Ireland. The objectives of the project are to review and document current procedures and practices used by the relevant authorities to investigate unauthorised waste activities, as well as the use of powers available to tackle unauthorised activities. I will carefully consider the results of this study to identify any further actions that may be necessary in consequence of its findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">The OEE has established an unauthorised waste working group, including representatives of the local authorities, the Northern Ireland authorities and my Department, whose functions include co-ordination of enforcement actions against companies and individuals involved in the illegal movement and disposal of waste in Ireland. Information and recommendations emerging from this process support a systematic plan of action to tackle offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">A further milestone for the OEE was the consolidation of environmental enforcement activity through the establishment of a national enforcement network. This network is harnessing the collective resources, expertise and investigative capacity of all the players engaged in stamping out illegal activity in Ireland. The network pools and co-ordinates the resources of the local authorities, the national bureau of criminal investigation of the Garda Síochána, the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland and my Department. This is resulting in a step up in actions against unauthorised waste movement, including roadblocks and inspections of suspect facilities. One such targeted exercise took place on 30 November 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_1361">I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 44, 46, 50 and 66 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">As the provisions of Part 6 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 dealing with dispute resolution only came into operation on 6 December 2004, along with all other provisions of the Act not previously commenced, insufficient time has elapsed for any formal applications for dispute resolution to have been received by the Private Residential Tenancies Board. I am confident that the new service will provide a speedier and generally more effective means of resolving disputes in the private rented sector and be very beneficial both to landlords and tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">Statutory responsibility for tenancy registration rests with the Private Residential Tenancies Board under the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. My Department understands that there has been a very positive response by landlords generally to registration. The receipt and processing of applications by the board is continuing and the volume of applications already received indicates that the level of registrations is likely to be high.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">While it may take some time to achieve maximum compliance, I am satisfied that landlords are increasingly becoming aware that it is in their interests to register and are generally showing willingness to comply with the registration requirement. Pursuance of non-compliant landlords and the initiation of proceedings against them, where necessary, is a matter for the board utilising its enforcement powers under the Act. I am confident that the board will be diligent in its efforts to secure the highest possible level of compliance with the registration requirement. I will be requesting regular progress reports on registration and my Department will maintain a general overview of the board's performance.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1366">Section 29 of the Waste Management Act 1996 sets out comprehensive provisions relating to the recovery of waste, including enabling provision for the making of regulations requiring producers, distributors or retailers of specific products or substances to operate deposit and refund schemes in respect of such products or substances, or of any component of, or packaging related to, such products or substances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">With regard to beverage containers, European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life. Under the directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005. Practical implementation of the directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry based compliance scheme operated by Repak which is working successfully and in 2001 met the target of 25% packaging waste recycling required by the directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">The EPA has reported in its National Waste Database Interim Report for 2002, published in June 2004, that packaging waste recovery increased further to an estimated 33% in that year. Progress has been further facilitated in the interim period arising from the implementation of the local and regional waste management plans, assisted by my Department from the environment fund, and new packaging regulations introduced last year requiring those who place packaging on the market to segregate their back door packaging waste and have it collected by authorised operators. Bottles and cans sold and consumed in pubs, clubs and hotels are all covered and must now be recycled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">The latest indications are that Ireland is on course to meet the higher recovery and recycling targets for end 2005. Successful deposit and refund schemes operating internationally for beverage containers are generally located in those countries where there has been no break in the continuity and cultural tradition of deposit and refund arrangements. This is not the case in Ireland and there would now quite likely be significant costs involved in re-establishing deposit and refund arrangements here. Account would also have to be taken of the possible impact on existing compliance arrangements. Given that these arrangements are achieving the desired result in meeting the recycling targets, the introduction of deposit and refund schemes for beverage containers is not under consideration.</p>

It would not be appropriate to comment further on the progress of this investigation at this stage. I have also asked all NPWS field staff in areas where there are breeding seal populations to be especially vigilant during the breeding season, when seals are particularly vulnerable.

The fleet of boats for use by NPWS staff is being upgraded and this should enhance the service's capability for carrying out surveillance work on the Blaskets and other offshore islands and locations where seals breed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1376">Regulations are currently being drafted to implement EU directives on end-of-life vehicles and waste electrical and electronic equipment. Following on the success of producer responsibility initiatives already operating in the areas of packaging, farm plastics and construction and demolition wastes, work is underway, in co-operation with the relevant stakeholders, in developing further PRIs for newsprint and tyres. These initiatives are in line with EU and national policy on waste management which is firmly grounded on the internationally recognised waste hierarchy which prioritises waste prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and the environmentally sound disposal of residual waste which cannot be recycled or recovered. This is reflected in my Department's policy documents Changing our Ways, 1998, and Taking Stock, Moving Forward, which was published earlier this year. Both of these publications are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">Other recent significant initiatives promoting, supporting and facilitating the prevention, minimisation and recovery of waste include the establishment of a market development group to identify market opportunities for materials recovered for recycling. It is hoped to publish a market development programme in the early part of 2005. The publication of a draft national waste prevention programme drawn up by a core prevention team established earlier this year in the EPA and the publication of a draft national biodegradable waste strategy setting out a range of integrated measures to achieve targets for 2013 took place earlier this year for public consultation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1381">The energy performance of buildings directive, EBPD — 2002/91/EC, was adopted on 16 December 2002. Member states must legally transpose the directive by 4 January 2006. However, the EPBD provides for a longer period, up to 4 January 2009, for the practical implementation of more complex provisions regarding the energy performance certification "labelling" of newly constructed buildings and existing buildings, when existing buildings are sold or let, improvement of the energy efficiency of boilers and inspection of air conditioning systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_1386">There are currently five directives in my Department's area of responsibility which are outstanding for transposition. These include 2000/53/EC — end-of-life vehicles, ELVs. This directive contains two stages of transposition, the first by 21 April 2002, for new vehicles sold after 1 July 2002, and the second by January 2007 for all other vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">There have been difficulties in reaching agreement with the motor industry on ELV take back arrangements required by the directive. However, written agreement was recently reached on a scheme to provide for free take back of all end of life vehicles during 2005. It is intended that the directive will be transposed in the first quarter of 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">EU Directive 2002/49/EC refers to assessment and management of environmental noise. Drafting of regulations to transpose this directive is well advanced and transposition is intended in early 2005. EU Directive 2002/88/EC refers to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery. Draft regulations are nearing completion with a view to circulation to relevant bodies for observations early in 2005. It is intended that the directive will be transposed in the first quarter of 2005. These regulations will also transpose Directive 2004/26/EC, on non-road mobile machinery, which has a transposition target date of 20 May 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">Directives 2002/95/EC and 2002/96/EC, with its amending Directive 2003/108/EC, are two related directives concerning, respectively, restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and arrangements for dealing with waste electrical and electronic equipment. Legislative proposals for the transposition of both directives are now in drafting. It is intended that the directive will be transposed in the first quarter of 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">I am keenly aware of the importance of timely transposition of EU environmental legislation, some 200 items of which, including more than 140 directives, have by now been transposed in this country. More recently, external legal and drafting expertise have been utilised in order to expedite this.</p>

            <p eId="para_1392">I refer to the reply to Question No. 13 of 4 November 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">With regard to the Irish Government's ongoing campaign against the Sellafield nuclear plant, effort is being directed at the successful completion of ongoing discussions between Irish and UK officials aimed at improving co-operation and consultations between the two countries in regard to Sellafield. These discussions arise from the provisional measures order granted to Ireland in June 2003 by the arbitration tribunal in the context of legal proceedings being brought by Ireland against the UK under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, in regard to the Sellafield MOX plant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">This order also made provisions for reports on progress towards developing the improved co-operation and consultation structures to be submitted by both Ireland and the UK to the tribunal on specified dates. The most recent report to the tribunal was submitted on schedule by both parties on 30 November 2004. The ongoing discussions and reports remain confidential to both parties and to the tribunal. However, it is my intention to report on any initiatives arising from this process in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">As the House will be aware, the substantive hearing of Ireland's legal action against the UK under UNCLOS is currently adjourned pending resolution of jurisdictional issues raised by the European Commission and which are now the subject of litigation between Ireland and the Commission before the European Court of Justice. With regard to the European Court of Justice case, pleadings have now been exchanged and Ireland has recently applied to the court for the holding of an oral hearing. A decision is awaited.</p>

            <p eId="para_1432">To apply for blue flag status, a beach must be a designated bathing area under the quality of bathing waters regulations. There are a total of 131 such bathing areas, 122 seawater and nine freshwater, designated in Ireland. The quality of the bathing water in these areas must comply with the guideline standards laid down in the EU bathing waters directive and the bathing areas must also comply with criteria specified by FEE regarding the facilities available and general management. These two conditions must be met in the bathing season -1 June to 31 August — of the year prior to the application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">My Department has requested a report from An Taisce as to the options and measures that might be pursued for increasing the number of blue flags awarded to areas in Ireland. The research is being undertaken by surveying the blue flag co-ordinators within the applicable local authorities and will deal with issues such as water quality, environmental education and information, environmental management, safety and other services. An Taisce aims to have the research completed by end of 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">I understand that water quality is the main factor for designated bathing areas not achieving blue flag status. I see considerable potential to increase the number of blue flag sites as a result of our greatly increased investment in new and upgraded water treatment plants and the measures to be taken under the nitrates action programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1464">Draft regulations have been published by my Department which contain a range of measures to further streamline the planning application process. In particular, a standard planning application form is proposed for use by all planning authorities. My Department is now considering submissions received on these draft regulations I have also recently launched a task force on e-planning which will recommend on measures necessary to facilitate the development of services to enable the public to interact with the planning system online. This interaction should include the online submission of planning applications and appeals to all planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála, in parallel with the existing paper system, by the end of 2007. Finally, the principal thrust of the new development management guidelines currently being prepared in my Department is improved and consistent procedures and practices in dealing with planning applications, in order to provide a better service for the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">As regards one off housing applications, draft guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing were published on 4 March 2004 for public consultation to give all those interested an opportunity to comment before the guidelines are finalised in statutory form. Submissions as regards the draft guidelines were to be submitted to the Department by 30 April 2004. In view of the importance of the rural housing issue, planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála were requested to have regard to the draft guidelines with effect from their date of publication. The guidelines are a material consideration both in respect of development plans and in the consideration of planning applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">Planning authorities are required to review and vary their development plans, where necessary, to ensure that their policies on rural settlement are consistent with the policies set out in the guidelines and to deal with individual planning applications on the basis recommended in the guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">A total of 105 submissions as regards the draft guidelines were received by the Department from interested organisations and individuals. The submissions have been examined in detail and I intend to carefully consider many suggestions that have been put forward for clarifying or improving the guidelines before they are finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">It is my intention that the guidelines will be issued in statutory form, shortly. The guidelines will then have the status of ministerial planning guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to which planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard when exercising their planning functions.</p>

The delay arose due to the need to consider also a more recently published report by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Review of Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management. This study looked at cancer, respiratory diseases and birth defects and found no evidence for a link between the incidence of the diseases and the current generation of incinerators.

            <p eId="para_1481">There are currently seven cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action as regards EU environmental directives, six of which are the direct responsibility of my Department. This figure includes one case where the Commission has applied to the court for a daily fine as regards the incomplete transposition of the environmental impact assessment directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">The six cases for which my Department has responsibility include the directive on dangerous substances in water. This directive is substantially implemented in the context of the Local Government Water Pollution Act and related legislation, under which water quality standards have been established for phosphorous and 14 other substances. EPA monitoring indicates that dangerous substances as addressed by this directive are generally not a problem in Irish waters. The directive is being further implemented in the context of the implementation of the water framework directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">As regards the directive on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, commonly known as EIA directive, the points at issue relate to measures to deal with peat extraction. The Commission applied to the European Court of Justice on 7 July 2003 seeking the application of a daily fine of €21,600 for each day of delay in implementing measures in the directive. There is ongoing communication with the Commission to resolve the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">Three cases relate to alleged failures to designate areas for conservation. The first case concerns the failure to fulfil obligations under the birds directive and the habitats directive and relates specifically to the effects of sheep overgrazing in the Owenduff and Nephin Beg regions. The Department is in communication with the Commission with a view to satisfying the requirements of the court. The second case relates to the designation of a sufficient number of special areas of conservation, SACs, under the habitats directive. The Department has worked to meet the requirements of the directive and has to all intents and purposes satisfied the requirements of the court judgment in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">The third case, proceedings in which were initiated by the Commission during October 2004, relates primarily to allegations that insufficient special protection areas, SPAs, have been classified under the birds directive and the habitats directive and that the protective mechanisms in place are insufficient. The defence in this case is currently being prepared. There are a number of related waste issues. The Advocate General delivered his opinion on this case to the European Court of Justice on 23 September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">The seventh case relates to matters for which the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility and concerns the shellfish waters directive. The Irish authorities have responded to the letter of formal notice of September 2004, providing clarification to the Commission on the areas in which the Irish implementation programme was deemed to be deficient.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">Two further cases referred to in the most recent reply to a question on this matter, Question No. 90 of 4 November 2004, are not now included as the judgments delivered by the European Court of Justice have been received. These cases related to end-of-life vehicles and reporting arrangements relating to ozone depleting substances. The current position as regards the former is set out in the reply to Question No. 24 on today's Order Paper, while a response to the latter judgment is being prepared.</p>

            <p eId="para_1499">The determination of waste management charges is statutorily a matter for the relevant local authority in cases where it acts as the service provider. Where, as may commonly occur, a private operator acts as service provider then that operator will determine the charges. Similarly, in regard to waiver schemes for waste charges, it is the responsibility of the local authority concerned to decide on the nature and extent of any such scheme in the case of services provided by itself. Generally speaking, waiver schemes do not operate in respect of privately supplied collection services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">In the case of Limerick City Council, I understand that the city council has received legal advice indicating that in the present circumstances obtaining in its area for the provision of domestic waste collection services, the council may not be empowered to provide a waiver scheme. It is for the council to address this matter in the context of the local circumstances involved and the possible measures available to it under the Waste Management Acts. Given the possibility of alternative approaches under existing legislation and differing arrangements across local authorities, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for amending legislation to prescribe a uniform approach to the design of waiver schemes by individual local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">The issue of waste charges and low income persons or households has been raised in a social partnership context.

            <p eId="para_1503">Apart from the provision of housing units to the local authority, an agreement under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 — 2002 may provide for: the transfer of land or sites to the local authority within the area of proposed development or within the functional area of the local authority; the transfer of fully or partially serviced sites to the local authority within its functional area; the transfer of fully or partially serviced sites to an approved housing body or other nominated persons; the payment of money in lieu of land, new units or sites; or any combination of these options.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">It should also be noted that Part V relates only to planning applications made in respect of land zoned for residential use or for a mixture of residential and other use and applies to developments consisting of five or more housing units. It does not, for example, relate to one off rural housing, which forms a significant proportion of planning applications in many counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">Part V is fully operational in all local authorities and all relevant residential planning applications are subject to a Part V agreement. However, the pace of activity in particular areas and, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of Part V housing units, is dependent on the level and commencement of private sector residential development and the nature of Part V agreements entered into. Indeed, on the basis of returns to my Department on the provision of housing units, land, sites and financial contributions to date, it is clear that activity under Part V is gathering momentum. Provisional figures for the first nine months of 2004 indicate that a total of 4,500 social and affordable units are now planned or proposed. On this basis I expect that the number of units to be acquired by local authorities in 2005 will be over 1,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">Accordingly, I am satisfied that the provisions of Part V are now being progressed that they will contribute significantly to the provision of social and affordable housing in future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1515">The Act takes account of the recommendations of the 1996 report of the reorganisation commission towards cohesive local government, town and county, regarding improved accessibility, interaction and linkages for all towns within their local county council areas as the way forward. Section 185 of the Act provides that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census and not having a town council may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council, in line with the population threshold recommended in that report. Under the relevant provisions of the Act, which I hope to commence in the near future, a proposal to establish a town council is, therefore, a matter for the local community in the first instance and thereafter a decision on whether to proceed further with such a proposal is a reserved function of the relevant county council, following a public consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">Under current local government law, there are five borough councils, each of which is responsible for a significant range of legal and administrative functions in their respective areas as well as contributing to local development in co-operation with their respective county councils. Any proposal to establish a new city council would require amending legislation and there are currently no proposals in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1518">The results of the statutory assessment of local authority housing need, which was undertaken in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of social housing, of which 2,468 were considered homeless and in need of local authority housing. Information on gender and the length of time these households were on the local authority waiting list was not collected.</p>

It is, however, the case that some applicants for local authority housing are on waiting lists for longer periods on the basis that their housing need has a relatively lower priority compared with the needs of households who have been allocated housing. The relative priority of households on the local authority waiting lists is determined in accordance with the authorities' scheme of letting priorities, the making of which is a function reserved to the elected members.</p>

            <p eId="para_1525">From the commencement of the single mandate for elective local government, local authorities were required to make specific arrangements to provide a reasonable level of service for Oireachtas Members and facilitate them in carrying out their work on behalf of local communities. Statutory regulations have been made in this connection. Copies of these regulations in the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003 and an information note are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">The regulations provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the supply of specified documentation to Oireachtas Members by the local authority and in this context a parliamentary representative may notify a local authority of his or her postal or electronic address. Systems, procedures and timeframes equivalent to those used for correspondence from local authority members also apply to Members of the Oireachtas. Similarly, where there are arrangements for electronic access to information by councillors, these should be made available to Members. Managers are required to meet at least annually with Members to provide them an opportunity for an update on developments and to allow them raise any difficulties encountered. This is additional to normal and regular contacts between public representatives and local authority officials regarding particular problems or issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">As these arrangements have been introduced relatively recently, an audit has not been carried out. The operation of the arrangements will be kept under review with a view to any necessary amendment of current guidance on these matters. In the meantime, I expect authorities to facilitate parliamentary representatives, in the spirit and the letter of the regulations, in the timely provision of local authority documentation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1536">The question of zoning land for different uses is a matter for each planning authority to address in the context of its development plan. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may include in their development plans objectives regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk of flooding. In exercising this function, planning authorities have the opportunity to ensure that existing flood risks are mitigated and that new development does not individually or cumulatively give rise to new flood risks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1544">The Government has put a wide range of measures in place at national, regional and local levels aimed at achieving the strategy's objectives over its 20 year horizon. The initial phases of NSS implementation have focused on embedding the policy approach of the NSS within key Departments, their agencies and the regional and local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">Significant milestones in this regard have included the adoption by all regional authorities of regional planning guidelines which will help to structure and inform local planning in the period to 2020; substantial progress in national development plan capital investment programmes endorsed by the NSS as providing the critical catch up infrastructure such as key road and rail links needed to support the achievement of more balanced regional development; mid-term review of the national development plan, which signalled the potential for further aligning NDP expenditure with the NSS planning framework, particularly in the environmental infrastructure and regional operational programmes; the establishment of implementation frameworks for the gateways on a phased basis, with frameworks now in place in Cork and Galway and work on similar frameworks advancing in other areas. The proposals announced earlier this year for substantial investment in new suburban rail services in the Cork area are a significant example of a direct response from the Government to the planning policies which have been put in place under one of the gateway frameworks referred to above and other responses are being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">NSS implementation is now seeking to focus on the identification of longer term development and investment prioritisation issues arising from the strategy's 20 year horizon. Key priorities over the next 12 months will include advancing a detailed study of issues arising in accelerating the development of the gateways as well as the development agencies and authorities in the gateways. This study will provide pointers on how the accelerated development of gateways can be better facilitated and promoted. It will intensify progress in co-ordinating activities in the areas of housing, environmental and water services infrastructure provision and local roads programmes in my Department to support the objectives of the NSS and the accelerated development of the gateways in particular. It will also build on bilateral links between my Department and other Departments and agencies in order to link their strategic and longer term planning of investment to NSS implementation activities such as the regional planning guidelines.</p>

            <p eId="para_1553">I am aware of the submission by Focus Ireland referred to in the question. The Government has responded actively to the increased level of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output significantly. The total Exchequer provision for 2005, of which €50 million of the capital element was announced in the budget, means that my Department will spend a record €1.3 billion on supports for social housing in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">This represents an increase of 19.8% on the expected outturn for 2004. This increase in provision for 2005 will allow us to make substantial further investment in our social and affordable housing programmes. These funds will enable the needs of over 13,000 households to be met through the broad range of existing social and affordable housing programmes operated by my Department and the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">The long-term housing needs of about 5,000 current recipients of rent supplement will be addressed through the new rent accommodation scheme. We expect increased activity under the main local authority programme, where we expect to start 5,500 new local authority houses, compared to an average of 4,700 in the last three years. Investment will continue in our ambitious regeneration programmes and other social housing measures, including houses completed by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. We expect additional output under affordable housing schemes, with over 3,000 households likely to benefit from these schemes in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">Earlier this year we initiated the development of five year action plans by local authorities for social and affordable housing. Focus Ireland has welcomed this approach. These plans provide a means of ensuring that these resources are used to best effect. The plans will allow for maximum output to be achieved through the effective planning of programmes and prioritisation in line with needs. Overall, our priority is to ensure that housing is delivered in a manner that breaks cycles of dependency and disadvantage. Good progress is being made in assisting the broad range of housing needs and this indicates the important priority that the Government attaches to this area.</p>

It is not proposed to amend the legislation in this regard. An electricity undertaking is not exempt from the requirement to publish in a newspaper its intention to apply for permission for the construction or erection of overhead transmission or distribution lines.</p>

            <p eId="para_1569">Other than Part V affordable units, no units have yet been completed on the State lands provided to the initiative. It can take a number of years from identification of a site through the various planning and construction processes before units for new housing schemes are finally delivered. However, all projects are being developed as a priority with a view to early delivery of units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">My Department has been examining a number of fast tracking options. One such option is the exchange of land for the delivery of units. In this respect, the Harcourt Terrace site was advertised on 17 November 2004 on a pilot basis. This particular project will be closely monitored with a view to the possibility of using the land swap option for other sites released to the initiative. The sale price of the housing units to be completed under the initiative will be dependent on a number of factors, including the size of the housing unit, its location and the cost of market value units in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1590">I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 to 125, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">The terms of reference of the post mortem inquiry require it to review post mortem policy, practice and procedure in all hospitals in the State since 1970, with particular reference to organ removal, retention, storage and disposal. The inquiry is also mandated to examine any arrangements with pharmaceutical companies regarding retained organs, including pituitary glands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">The chairman has confirmed that the inquiry has received considerable co-operation from each of the hospitals with which it is dealing and that the inquiry's non-statutory nature has not thus far significantly hampered its substantive work. The chairman has indicated that she will provide a report on paediatric hospitals in December 2004. There are ongoing consultations with the inquiry on the other elements of its remit, having regard to the Government decision that the inquiry should conclude by 31 March next. Pending receipt of the chairman's report, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the actions of specific pharmaceutical companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">Individual hospitals have adopted differing policies on the question of contacting next of kin of deceased persons whose pituitary glands were retained. For example, one hospital recently made contact with next of kin to advise them that pituitary glands of deceased relatives had been retained. I understand that some of those contacted were greatly distressed at the news. Subsequently, another hospital decided not to make direct contact with next of kin and instead placed notices in the newspapers inviting next of kin of patients who died during specific periods of time to make contact with the hospital if they wished to know whether glands had been retained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">By 31 August 2004, the inquiry had incurred direct expenditure of €11,577,610. This includes fees to the inquiry's legal team and costs associated with the establishment, rental and administration of the inquiry office. My Department has also provided funding to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Parents for Justice in respect of inquiry related expenditure amounting to €6,780,424. This brings the total expenditure relating to the inquiry to the end of August 2004 to €18.358 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_1596">The introduction of statutory entitlement to a medical card for all persons, aged 70 years and over, who are resident in Ireland, came into effect on 1 July 2001. All persons in this age category qualify free of charge for general practitioner services from a general practitioner in their area who holds a general medical services contract with the local health board. This covers surgery and domiciliary visits where clinically deemed necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">They are also entitled to prescribed approved drugs and medicines from community pharmacists, dental and ophthalmic benefits under the GMS scheme, free of charge, and may avail of a range of community based and provided services. They are also not liable for statutory charges for hospital services provided as an inpatient or as an outpatient, when referred by a general practitioner. I have no plans to introduce legislation to change the current statutory eligibility entitlement arrangements for persons aged 70 years and over.</p>

            <p eId="para_1623">Section 30 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland) 1880 provides that it is an offence to wilfully give false information to a registrar for the purpose of registering a birth.

The particular entry in the register of births referred to by the Deputy was referred to the appropriate authorities. There were three other cases of a similar nature at that particular time. The procedures for the registration of births was reviewed following these incidents and currently incorporate a requirement that proof of identity be produced to the registrar by an informant, the person who gives the information and who will sign the entry in the register, in order to ensure the proper registration of births and prevent any irregularity or false registration.</p>

This procedure, which entails an application to the courts to determine the parentage of the child, will also address the alleged irregularity in the current registration of the birth.

            <p eId="para_1629">I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 142 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">There are no proposals to alter current arrangements regarding the taxation of maintenance payments, which have been in place since June 1983. The general position in the case of legally enforceable maintenance agreements is that: the spouse who pays the maintenance is entitled to a tax deduction for payments made for the benefit of the other spouse; the maintenance payments are taxed in the hands of the receiving spouse; and the couple are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">However, a separated couple may, except where a civil annulment has been obtained, jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place provided they are both resident in the State and, if divorced, neither has remarried. When such an election is made, the maintenance payments are ignored for tax purposes — the payer does not receive a tax deduction for them and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them. Where the receiving spouse has income other than the maintenance, separate assessment will apply in respect of that income. The Revenue Commissioners' information leaflet IT2 — Taxation of Married Couples — which is available on its website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i> sets out how separate assessment works.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">In the case of non-legally binding maintenance payments, such payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse and the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for them. However, the paying spouse would be entitled to the married person's tax credit if he or she is wholly or mainly maintaining the other spouse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">In the arrangements which apply, there is an underlying principle in place that income in the form of the maintenance payments should be subject to taxation. If the general position relating to legally enforceable separation agreements were to be altered so that the payer rather than the recipient were to be subject to tax on the amount of the maintenance, such a move would benefit recipients but the position of those who are required to make such payments would disimprove.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">The question of pay related social insurance deductions from maintenance payments or the reckoning of income in the form of maintenance payments for social welfare means test purposes would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1640">I assume the Deputy is referring to the request by the Blind Car Owners and Users Association to extend the medical criteria for eligibility for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers — tax concessions — scheme to those who are blind.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">The disabled drivers and disabled passengers — tax concessions — scheme is open to people with disabilities who meet the specified criteria and have obtained a primary medical certificate to that effect. The senior area medical officer attached to the relevant local health board is responsible for both the medical assessment and the issue of the medical certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1642">The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers — tax concessions — regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria as set out above is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate qualifies the holder for remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax, VRT, a repayment of value added tax, VAT, on the purchase of the vehicle and a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">An interdepartmental review group was established to review the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers'— tax concessions — scheme. The group examined all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria. The report was published on my Department's website in early July and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. As agreed by Government in June, I will consider the report on an ongoing basis in the overall budgetary context having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">I decided in the course of preparations for budget 2005 that I would not make any changes to the scheme at this time. However, as I stated in my recent budget speech, €2.8 billion overall will be provided as part of the Estimates in 2005 specifically for people with disabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1647">The Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. Once the necessary legislative framework has been put in place, day to day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, and the Minister for Finance does not get involved in the day to day activities of the financial regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">I am satisfied that the legislative provisions which have been put in place provide a sound basis for financial regulation in Ireland. Moreover, I am satisfied that this code of legislation is being adequately applied and enforced by IFSRA. The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Acts 2003 and 2004 represent a radical restructuring of financial regulation in Ireland. The establishment of a single structure to take in work previously done by four separate bodies, the greater emphasis on consumer concerns, the enhancement of the regulator's powers, including administrative sanctions, enhanced provision for co-operation between the various authorities, the provision for establishment of a statutory financial services ombudsman scheme and of new consultative mechanisms for consumers and industry will contribute to the better regulation of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">However, it is my intention to learn from the experience of the operation of IFSRA, and from various recent reports, so as to keep our legislative framework efficient and up to date. My Department has initiated a public consultation process with a view to consolidating, simplifying and updating our financial services legislation. My ongoing aim is to ensure that our legislation continues to meet the Government's consumer protection and stability objectives in a way that minimises the regulatory burden on industry and otherwise complies with our international obligations and the Government's better regulation agenda, promoting the development of a sector that is competitive both domestically and internationally and operating to high standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1651">Section 151 of the Finance Act 2000 introduced an exemption from capital acquisitions tax, CAT, for certain dwelling houses. The purpose of this exemption was to benefit individuals who had been living in a house for a period prior to taking the benefit, either by way of gift or inheritance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling house must have resided in the house for a minimum of three years prior to the gift or inheritance and must not have had an interest in any other dwelling house. In addition, the recipient must continue, except where he or she is aged 55 years at the date of the gift or inheritance, or has died, to occupy that dwelling house as his-her only or main residence for a period of six years commencing on the date of the gift or inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of CAT when it is the subject of a gift or inheritance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">In the present case, it would appear that the nephew or niece has resided in the dwelling house for over three years and is over 55 years and, therefore, an inheritance of the dwelling house taken by the nephew or niece will be exempt from CAT once the nephew or niece had no interest in any other dwelling house.</p>

            <p eId="para_1655">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is their policy to make available a wide range of electronic payment options for the payment of tax, including fixed amount direct debit, electronic payments options through the Revenue on-line system, ROS, and single debit authority. Single debit authority allows a taxpayer/business to nominate the bank account to be debited for the single amount specified on the debit instruction attached to the tax return. The option to pay VAT by means of single debit authority has been available since early 2004 and the option was continued on to the redesigned VAT 3 that was introduced in September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">It is planned to introduce single debit authority as a payment option for the payment of the P30 monthly employers PAYE/PRSI at the earliest opportunity. However, in view of the development priorities already scheduled by the Revenue Commissioners for 2005, the earliest opportunity to introduce single debit authority for P30 payments is early 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_1667">My Department administers the alternative energy requirement, the underlying principle of which is that prospective generators are invited to make a formal application to build, own and operate newly installed renewable energy based electricity generating plant and to supply electricity from these to the ESB under a power purchase agreement of up to 15 years' duration. Full details of the AER programme, including those producers who took part in the process, are available on my Departments website at <i>www.dcmnr.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1669">The green electricity market has been fully liberalised since February 2000, some five years ahead of full market liberalisation in 2005. I do not have full details of the producers working in this market as some of them operate outside of the programmes run by my Department. The licensing of green energy suppliers is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation. CER.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, is an agency established by Government in 2002, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. SEI is responsible for the roll out of the energy measure of the sustainable energy priority of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. SEI implements a range of programmes, which includes three programmes in the industry sector, four programmes in the built environment, four renewable energy programmes, as well as specialised statistical analysis and policy advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">The renewable energy research and development programme provides support for renewable energy research and demonstration projects. The programme launched a new strategy in June 2004. To date the programme has approved over €5 million of projects covering biomass, biofuels, wave, wind, solar and geothermal energy. The renewable energy information office is a national service of SEI, established to promote the use of renewable energy and to provide advice and information both to the industry and to individual members of the public.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1700">An embargo exists on trade in arms and related materials between EU member states and China and has been in place since the events in Tiananmen Square, in June 1989. This embargo forbids trade in arms and related material of all types, such as weapons, ammunition, military vehicles and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">I am aware of the position of the European Coalition against the Lifting of the EU's Embargo on Weapons Sales to China, which, in a statement issued on 3 December 2004, called on the EU to retain its embargo on the sale of arms to China. The Government will continue to examine this issue with our EU partners, considering our overall relationship with China, our ongoing commitment to human rights and the broader regional and international context. The Government's approach has been conveyed to the Chinese authorities, most recently during talks with Vice-Premier Huang Ju on 16 November 2004, and also by the Taoiseach during his discussions with Premier Wen when they met in the margins of the ASEM summit, in Hanoi, on 9 October 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">The issue was again discussed by the GAERC on 22 November 2004, in the context of preparation of the EU-China summit, which took place at The Hague on 8 December 2004. Ministers agreed at the GAERC that the EU was ready to give a positive signal to China on lifting the embargo. However, they agreed that before lifting the embargo, work must be completed on strengthening the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which sets out criteria governing all arms exports from the EU. In addition, the Union would hope for further demonstration by the Chinese authorities of their good intentions in regard to human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">The issue of the arms embargo against China was discussed at the EU-China summit. The EU side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo. The Chinese side welcomed this positive signal and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU. The EU reaffirmed that work on strengthening the application of the European Union code of conduct on arms exports was continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">As has been consistently stated, Ireland and our EU partners take concerns about human rights in China very seriously. These matters are regularly, and on an ongoing basis, raised with the Chinese Government. In line with EU convention in these matters, individual member states were represented by the Presidency at the EU-China summit, where human rights issues were raised with the Chinese. The leaders underlined the importance of concrete steps in the field of human rights and reaffirmed their commitment to further enhance co-operation and exchanges in this field on the basis of equality and mutual respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">Human rights concerns are also raised at a bilateral level. Most recently, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and I held official talks with the Chinese Vice-Premier, Mr Huang Ju, in Dublin Castle, on 16 November 2004, during which we again raised our concerns about human rights. The Chinese Vice-Premier, in response, informed us of the measures his government is taking in the field of human rights, including the addition of an express provision on human rights to China's constitution earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">The Taoiseach also raised the issue of human rights with the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, during his visit to Ireland in May 2004. During his discussions, he outlined Ireland's strong commitment to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Both sides agreed on the importance of co-operation and dialogue in working together to bring about respect for international obligations. In his capacity as President of the EU Council, my predecessor also raised human rights concerns during the EU Foreign Ministers Troika meeting with China on 19 April 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">During the Irish Presidency, and in conjunction with our EU partners, we organised the first EU-China seminar on the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, which took place in Beijing, on 30 June and 1 July 2004. The purpose of the seminar was to provide technical assistance to China in preparation for its ratification of the ICCPR. A subsequent EU-China seminar on the ratification of the ICCPR took place in The Hague on 8 and 9 November 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">The EU-China human rights dialogue, established in 1996, is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns about individual human rights cases and more general issues, such as the protection of freedom of religion and expression. The most recent round of the EU-China human rights dialogue took place in Beijing on 24 September 2004. The specific case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche was raised during the dialogue. The Chinese authorities replied that his appeal against the death sentence, suspended for two years, originally handed down in his case, was rejected on 23 January 2003. Under Article 52 of the criminal law, if a person sentenced to death with suspension of execution does not intentionally commit a crime in that period, his sentence may be reduced to a term of imprisonment of between 15 and 25 years. The period of suspension will end on 23 January 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">At the request of Ireland and a number of other EU partners, this case was raised again on 25 November during a <i>démarche</i> carried out in Beijing by the local EU Troika. This <i>démarche</i>, while expressing the EU’s continuing concerns about the trial and conviction of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, urged China not to carry out the sentence of death during the remainder of the two year period and to commute his sentence to one of imprisonment. The Troika emphasised that execution of the death penalty would negatively affect EU relations with China. In response to concerns expressed by the EU Troika about the lack of legal representation by Tenzin Delek Rinpoche at his trial, the Chinese side informed the Troika that he did have legal representation during his trial and conveyed the names of his two lawyers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to keep these matters under review and encourage the Chinese authorities to respect fully human rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_1730">The purpose of the recent amendment which I introduced to the Road Traffic Bill 2004 is not to limit claims against motor insurance companies but to protect the interests of motorists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">Under the Road Traffic Act 1961, users of mechanically propelled vehicles must be insured without limit against liability for personal injury to third parties in a public place. The insurance industry has informed me of its concerns about not being in a position to provide unlimited cover for motorists as its own reinsurers are indicating unwillingness to continue the necessary unlimited cover for the companies themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">I recognise the value of insurance cover for unlimited liability for personal injury. However, I have to ensure that adequate levels of cover continue to be available in the event of substantive reinsurance difficulties. For that reason it is prudent to provide for a legal framework to deal with the situation where insurance companies could no longer provide unlimited cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">I am aware of concerns about introducing a limit on the amount of cover required and I share those concerns. The amendment proposed in the Road Traffic Bill 2004 now includes a provision requiring that regulations to specify an upper limit on the amount of motor insurance cover required by law would be subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before they could take effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">Information regarding personal injury claims against individual motor insurers is not compiled in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1758">The primary responsibility for EU environmental directives lies with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I am not aware of any non-compliance on the part of the Government with EU directives in respect of the Owenriff river. The freshwater pearl mussel population in the Owenriff catchment suffered losses in the early part of the summer of this year. The precise cause of these losses has not been established. The losses were associated with algal growth at a time when water levels in the river were particularly low, following a prolonged dry spell, and preceded forestry felling operations by Coillte in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">To determine best practice in forest management in the Owenriff catchment and to gather views and expert opinion to support a practical decision making process, a working group comprising representatives of the forest service, national parks and wildlife service, the Western Regional Fisheries Board and Coillte was established and met for the first time in August. The group has examined relevant research on the ecological status of the Owenriff and similar river catchments, and the interaction with forest cover and forest operations. The group was assisted in this work by experts from a number of Government agencies and third level bodies, including the EPA, the Central Fisheries Board, the national parks and wildlife service, UCD and COFORD. Officials from Galway County Council and the Scottish Argyll Fisheries Trust also participated. The working group is using this scientifically based approach to help formulate an appropriate forestry management response for the Owenriff.</p>

The group expressed its views as to the algal problem in Lough Corrib. In my opinion, it is not possible at this stage to link the Owenriff incident with the wider problems on Lough Corrib. However, following our meeting, arrangements were put in place for officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, my Department and Coillte to meet the local group to discuss its concerns and proposals in more detail. I understand that a date of 17 January has now been agreed for this meeting.</p>

Even though this animal was not part of the suckler cow application, EU rules mean that its non-compliance with identification and registration requirements will result in a penalty being applied to all bovine schemes for which applications have been submitted. This penalty will be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 42 and 43 of the terms and conditions of the scheme and will apply at balancing payment stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1782">The EOCP is a seven year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000- 2006 and, following the mid-term review, additional funding of approximately €12 million was made available for the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to €449.3 million. This now includes an increased provision for capital developments for which €157 million has been set aside.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">Since 2000, my Department, with the technical assistance of ADM Limited, has processed and I have approved 1,271 applications for capital grant assistance of over €118 million and 1,015 applications for staffing grant assistance totalling €104 million. Almost €44 million has been allocated for projects under the quality measure. Much of the remaining current funding is required for ongoing supports to groups providing child care services to disadvantaged families to enable them to participate in employment, education and training opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">The provision of an additional capital allocation totalling €90 million over five years for the development of child care facilities was made in the context of the recent budget. As a result, I will make an announcement in connection with the allocation of the first tranche of that funding very shortly, following which my Department will write to all applicants for capital grant assistance. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on these capital grant applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_1787">Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp;  O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_527">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1818">While I have no plans to publish a White Paper on penal reform at this time, a number of significant changes to the Irish penal system are in the process of being introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">The Deputy is no doubt aware of the position regarding my proposals for the application of more efficient staffing arrangements in the Prison Service and the elimination of overtime. Discussions are ongoing between the Irish Prison Service and the Prison Officers' Association about eliminating overtime and reducing other costs. These discussions are close to being concluded. The Irish Prison Service is hopeful that an agreement will be finalised in the next month or so and that staff will ballot for acceptance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">New rules for the government of prisons will be introduced in the very new future. These rules, which will set out in considerable detail the full range of rights, duties and obligations for prisoners, prison staff and management, are expected to be finalised by the start of the new year. European standards for prisons have been taken into account in the drafting of the new rules. The rules will come into force, as a statutory instrument, as soon as possible after the text has been finalised. Preparation of a drugs policy for the Irish Prison Service is at an advanced stage and is expected to be published early next year. The intention is that the new policy will facilitate consistent regulation and operational structure in pursuing both supply and demand reduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 and associated rules were commenced by me with effect from 12 November 2004. The Act provides a clearer legislative basis for the power to grant temporary release by setting down the principles which will apply to the exercise of this power. The Act amends section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 and provides a clear and transparent basis, as well as the necessary safeguards required, for the operation of the system of temporary release.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">As Minister, within the resources available to me, I have strengthened the probation and welfare service, especially in the area of youth justice, in order to work to reduce the need to send young offenders into custodial settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. It is the underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations when other alternative diversions and community based options have been resorted to and have failed. The Act is being implemented on a phased basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">The first commencement order under the Act was signed by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, <i>inter alia</i>, the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children, section 113 of the Act; a court order which would require parents to exercise proper and adequate control over their children, section 114 of the Act. On 29 July 2004, sections 78-87 of the Children Act 2001 were commenced. These sections provide for the court directed family conference which is convened by the probation and welfare service. It is expected that the first of the new community sanctions will come on stream in 2005, subject to the availability of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">Under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983, a court may make a community service order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the order being made. The order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months. The aim of a community service order is to rehabilitate the offender through the discipline of having to work in the community and the making of meaningful reparation to that community for his or her crime. The courts already have and do exercise wide discretion in using community service orders in dealing with people over 16 years of age who offend. It is used in practice for all age categories of offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">My Department also funds two restorative justice projects through the probation and welfare service, the victim-offender service in Tallaght and the Nenagh reparation project. Both projects work closely with the community and have community representation on their management committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">Within the prison custodial system, there is a wide range of services in place aimed at providing offenders with the means to avoid re-offending following their return to the community. The services provided include work skills, training and education and are matched, where possible, to individual aptitudes and abilities, sometimes unrecognised or untapped prior to imprisonment. In addition, a range of medical, psychological and other support services are available to assist those suffering from particular problems such as drug addiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">As part of its commitment to re-balancing the custodial and care/rehabilitation functions in prisons, the Irish Prison Service has established a regimes directorate, composed of a multidisciplinary team of staff. The formation of this directorate is facilitating the adoption of a multifaceted approach to helping prisoners to develop their sense of responsibility and encouraging those attitudes and skills which will assist them to return to society with the best chance of leading law abiding and self supporting lives after release. These services are also important in sustaining prisoners' physical and mental health, counteracting the detrimental effects of imprisonment, encouraging positive personal development from within and preparing for their integration into wider society as law abiding citizens on release from custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">Implementing positive sentence management is a key task for the Irish Prison Service. A scoping group to examine positive sentence management was established by the Irish Prison Service in 2003 and it will present its report to the interim board of the Irish Prison Service early in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">Elaboration of positive sentence management will involve a new orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and a new emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons. The end result should be a prisoner-centred, multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">I recently announced that the capital building allocation to my Department for next year will facilitate the implementation of the prisons building and refurbishment programme to improve facilities for prisoners, including the elimination of the practice of slopping out, the reduction of overcrowding and the use of padded cells and facilitate a more cost effective operation of the Prison Service. The introduction of video conferencing facilities in Cloverhill Prison for certain court proceedings as well as for other purposes, such as legal consultations for prisoners, is also being pursued by the Prison Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">Specifically, this allocation will enable the Irish Prison Service to commence work on the following capital projects next year: the construction of a new 150 capacity prisoner accommodation block at Portlaoise Prison. This block will also include new education, work training and other ancillary facilities. The building of new facilities at Limerick Prison will provide for education, medical and other ancillary services. The Irish Prison Service is also examining the provision of additional prisoner accommodation at Wheatfield Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">I hope to be in a position to make a separate announcement in the near future regarding the development of the new Mountjoy complex.</p>

            <p eId="para_1841">Some 283 prisoners were serving sentences for sexual offences on 8 December last. Three forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders are in operation in the prison system: individual counselling from the Prison Service's psychology unit and the probation and welfare service, the sex offender programme which has been in operation since 1994 and one-to-one interventions by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. Some 106 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date and a further eight men are undertaking the programme in Arbour Hill Prison. The total number of places available on the programme is eight. The vast majority of such offenders have been released on the expiration of their sentences. With the exception of five men who are serving life sentences, the rest are due for release over the next three years. No waiting list is in operation for those who are willing to participate in the programme. All sex offenders are invited to apply for a place on the programme when a new group being set up.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">The probation and welfare service organises a Dublin based programme, in partnership with the Granada Institute. Offenders coming out of prison may be referred to the programme, regardless of whether they have participated in a sex offender programme. The programme involves community sex offender group treatment for men who have offended against children. There are eight places in each programme and two programmes are run per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">International research has found that treatment programmes, such as the cognitive behavioural, offence focused programme operating in the prison system, can contribute to community safety because those who complete such programmes are less likely to re-offend than those who do not participate in them. The most recent meta-analysis of 43 treatment outcome studies, Hanson et. al. 2002, found a significant treatment effect and a reduced recidivism rate of 9.9% for offenders who participated, compared to 17.4% for those who did not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">An independent evaluation of the Prison Service programme was recently completed by UCD's psychology department — O'Reilly and Carr, 2004. The study found that the sex offender programme complies with the highest international standards of programme delivery and that the programme has achieved significant positive changes in the psychological risk factors in men who have successfully completed it. The study's findings will contribute to the future development of a multi-disciplinary sex offender rehabilitation programme, which will significantly enhance access to intensive group therapy for sex offenders.</p>

The board is requested to provide its comments and observations on the complaint, including any steps it has taken to deal with it at school level.</p>

Such service is therefore fundamentally different in nature from full-time employment in the Permanent Defence Force. Permanent Defence Force service is the principal source of employment and income for members of the PDF.

            <p eId="para_1920">The concept of pensionability which applies to employment in the Permanent Defence Force would be quite inappropriate regarding the nature of the service of the Reserve Defence Force.

            <p eId="para_1922">Assessments of housing needs are undertaken on a triennial basis by local authorities. The last assessment was undertaken in March 2002 and earlier ones were carried out in 1999 and 1996. The next assessment of housing need will be undertaken by local authorities in March 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">The results of the 2002 assessment indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of social housing compared with 39,176 in 1999, an increase of 9,137 households or 23.5%. The results of the 1996 assessment indicated a total of 27,427 households in need of social housing. The period from 1996 to 2002 has seen an increase of 20,986, or 77%, in numbers of households on waiting lists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">The Government has been conscious of the increased level of social housing need and has responded actively to this situation by expanding social and affordable housing output. It is anticipated that total social housing output this year, taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures, will meet the needs of around 13,000 households. That compares with some 7,000 in 1993.</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">The Government is allocating record levels of funding to local authorities for their social and affordable housing programmes in 2005. The total Exchequer capital funding available for social and affordable housing in 2005, taking account of the additional resources announced in the budget, will be almost €1.18 billion, which represents an increase of 17% on the likely outturn in 2004. That provision will allow for 5,500 new local authority houses to be started in 2005, which compares to an average of 4,700 starts in the last three years.</p>

        if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the national climate change strategy for Ireland 2000 states on page 50 that, in the commercial sector, a mandatory energy rating system will be developed to promote greater awareness of the cost of energy as a portion of the overall costs of building rental and adjustments to the tax treatment of leases will be made if it becomes clear by 2003 that the energy rating system is not providing the necessary incentive on its own to reduce energy use in the sector; the progress that has been made towards meeting this specific target and the goals outlined elsewhere in the strategy.

            <p eId="para_1971">The energy rating initiatives foreseen in chapter 6 of the national climate change strategy were overtaken by the adoption by the EU of the energy performance of buildings directive — 2002/91/EC of 16 December 2002.

            <p eId="para_1984">Census returns indicate that the population of three Dublin constituencies — North Central, North East and North West — fell between 1996 and 2002. I am not aware of research that provides a definitive explanation for the decline in population in these areas, though it may in part be a consequence of decreasing household size.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">Population in a given area can be consolidated by various means, including fiscal measures and planning policies which promoter greater residential densities. For instance, the recent decision to remove or reduce stamp duty on the purchase of second hand homes by first-time buyers should encourage newly formed family units to move into family sized homes in mature suburbs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1986">With regard to planning, my Department in 1999 published residential density guidelines for planning authorities encouraging the provision of additional dwellings within inner suburban areas of towns or cities which can be served by existing or planned public transport services. Such dwellings can be provided either by infill residential development or the subdivision of existing residential properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">One of the primary objectives of the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area, 2002-2016, which will inform development planning, is to consolidate population and household growth within the metropolitan area. To this end, the guidelines address the need for measures to facilitate increased occupancy rates in relevant areas.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_564">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_1989">I am satisfied that my Department is making good progress overall in meeting the budgetary and output targets associated with the implementation of measures under the national development plan. While progress was initially slow on some measures, expenditure is approaching target, and this is being reflected in increased outputs. I am confident that this trend will continue for the remaining period of the national development plan. The latest progress figures, as reflected in reply to this question, are based on the situation at end June 2004. Capital expenditure on most of my Department's programmes has accelerated during the second half of 2004 and this should be reflected in improved rates of progress when end-2004 data is completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">By the end of June 2004, a total of 285 water services schemes had been completed and cumulative expenditure, at €2.152 billion, was running at 83% of the expenditure forecast to the end of the year. Priority has been given to completing the largest infrastructural projects and these schemes have optimised the return on investment in terms of their positive impact on the environment and their role in the achievement of the overall objectives of the national development plan. At the end of June 2004, the increase in wastewater treatment capacity provided since 2000 was equivalent to the needs of a population of 2.8 million and, over the same period, additional drinking water treatment capacity, equivalent to the needs of a population of 575,000, was also provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1991">The water services investment programme for the years 2004 to 2006 contains 869 projects at various stages of construction and underlines my Department's continued commitment to water and wastewater infrastructure provision. Work is under way on reviewing targets and objectives to better reflect the progress achieved and anticipated up to the end of the national development plan period and will be completed in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">My Department is also reviewing the programme complement for housing in a similar context. Cumulative expenditure on housing to June 2004 is of the order of €5.73 billion, or 91.8% of the allocation to end 2004. Despite significant progress in terms of output it has not been possible to achieve some mid-term targets due to higher than anticipated construction and serviced land costs. The Government's decision to introduce multi-annual capital investment programmes provides an important opportunity to ensure a structured basis for the planning and delivery of all social and affordable housing programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">Output under the non-national roads measure is ahead of target, with improvements to 19,400 kilometres of non-national roads up to end June 2004. This is 80% of the final NDP target. Expenditure, at €1.8 billion to end June 2004, is at 96% of profiled expenditure for the year. I am confident this very good rate of physical progress will continue for the remaining years of the NDP, thereby contributing to the social and economic development of the regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1994">Cumulative expenditure on the rural water measure to end-June 2004 amounts to €253.86 million, or 57% of the allocation to the end of 2004. While expenditure on this measure is behind target, nearly 240,000 people are benefiting from new or improved rural water schemes. This is approximately 90% of the final target in the national development plan. Percentage compliance with the drinking water regulations, at 81%, exceeds the mid-term target of 75%, but work remains to be done over the coming years to achieve the final target of 95%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">Expenditure on the waste management measure is behind target, as delays in the adoption of waste management plans by local authorities precluded expenditure in the first two years of the national development plan. However, the rate of expenditure has increased significantly, reflecting good progress in delivering modern waste infrastructure facilities. I am confident this rate of progress will continue during the remaining years of the national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">Up to the end of June 2004, over €50 million had been spent on the urban and village renewal measure. While expenditure has been at roughly 50% of target, over 500 projects have been completed or are under way. This measure aims to make cities, towns and villages more attractive places in which to live and work. It also seeks to encourage social and economic development and to facilitate and support the development of tourism and tourism related activity. While this measure was slow to get under way in the early years of the NDP, much progress has been made in more recent years and I am confident that it will meet its budgetary and output targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1997">Expenditure under the habitats protection and conservation measure did not reach the mid-term target and output under the measure has also been behind target. Due to significant difficulties in acquiring suitable sites, development of two visitor centres has been slower than anticipated. However, sites have been bought in both cases, and it is hoped that both centres will be built within budget before the end of the NDP period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">Funding is also provided under this measure for conservation purposes by way of the acquisition of designated lands and compensation to landowners who forego income as a result of designation. It is very difficult to forecast the level of expenditure associated with these payments. My Department has prepared revised indicators that will better reflect the progress being made under this measure and, subject to approval, these will be in use from spring 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">Revised indicators have also been prepared for the heritage conservation measure where cumulative expenditure to end June 2004 is at 53.6% of target. A total of 48 heritage sites have been improved to end June, up from 36 sites at the end of 2003. Heritage sites attracted some 2.4 million visitors in 2003, which is 92% of the final NDP target.</p>

            <p eId="para_2003">I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 to 246, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">In order to meet anticipated demand for water and water treatment facilities, the national development plan provides for investment of €4.4 billion in water services infrastructure up to the end of 2006, approximately three times the amount expended during the 1994-99 period. Substantial increases in water treatment and storage capacity are being achieved as a result of this increased investment. Schemes completed since 1997 have produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 985,000. The increase in storage capacity over the same period was sufficient to meet the requirements of a population of 1,575,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2005">Management of public drinking water supplies is in general the responsibility of the local authorities which have a range of instruments and measures available to them to conserve sufficient stocks to meet anticipated needs. In support of the water service activities of local authorities, my Department co-ordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved infrastructure, active leakage control, telemetry and rehabilitation of water mains.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">Details of approved proposals for further new and upgraded public water supply schemes are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2004-2006, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The schemes included in the programme are mainly derived from regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting additional water supply requirements. These assessments will continue to be taken into account in future phases of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2007">Successive EPA reports on drinking water quality verify the fundamentally good quality of public drinking water supplies in Ireland. The most recent EPA report, for 2002, confirms a compliance rate with mandatory drinking water standards for public water supplies of over 97%. In addition, earlier this year I announced a record allocation of €110 million for the 2004 rural water programme. The main focus of this allocation is on upgrading group water schemes using sub-standard private sources. These schemes serve approximately 4% of households nationally and planned upgrades are being advanced as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2008">Overall, the resources being put in place should ensure that the coverage and quality of the national water supply infrastructure adequately caters for all demands placed on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_2012">In accordance with the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations, 2000, local authorities are responsible for taking the necessary measures to ensure that water intended for human consumption conforms to prescribed standards. Detailed information in the quality of individual water supplies is available in the annual reports published by the EPA on the quality of drinking water in Ireland. The most recent such report is for the year 2002 and a copy is available in the Oireachtas Library. More recent information in respect of the quality of individual water supplies in not available in my Department but may be available from the relevant local authority.</p>

The schemes included in the programme are derived from the priorities identified by the council in response to my Department's request to all local authorities last year to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital water services works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. I am arranging to have a copy of Kilkenny County Council's assessment forwarded to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2017">Section 37 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that, in determining an appeal, An Bord Pleanála is restricted to considering the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, regard being had <i>inter alia</i> to the provisions of the development plan. The section provides that the board may grant permission where the proposed development materially contravenes the development plan. However, where a planning authority has decided to refuse permission on the grounds that a proposed development materially contravenes the development plan, the board may grant permission only in certain limited circumstances. For example, the board may grant permission in material contravention of an objective of the development plan where it considers that there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or that permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to any statutory ministerial planning guidelines or any relevant policy of the Government or any Minister of the Government.</p>
