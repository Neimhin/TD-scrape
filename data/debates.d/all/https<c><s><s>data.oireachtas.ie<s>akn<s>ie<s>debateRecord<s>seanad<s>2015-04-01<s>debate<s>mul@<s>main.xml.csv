#MarieMoloney	unknown-#MarieMoloney-party	unknown-#MarieMoloney-dob	unknown-#MarieMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	1	I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to take this matter which concerns a scheme to support national organisations. The scheme provided multi-annual funding for such national organisations toward core costs associated with the provision of services. Priority is given under the scheme to supporting national organisations which provide services that target disadvantaged groups. As the Minister of State will be aware, in the summer of 2014, 23 health and disability organisations were excluded from the scheme. The Minister will also be aware that bridging funding was provided for 12 months by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, to help these organisations, but, unfortunately, this funding will end in June. The organisations are now in limbo as they cannot receive confirmation from the Minister's Department as to whether there will be a continuation of funding after June. In January they were told by officials of the Department that they would know by the end of March, but that information has not been forthcoming. One may wonder why the provision of funding for a health and disability organisation comes under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, but not everything is about a health issue. Many people, having been diagnosed with a disability, are well able to contribute to and participate in community organisations. The funding is used to support people to live as full a life as possible and continue their involvement in the community. It also supports the families of those diagnosed with a disability. It is vital for the continuation of support groups. Last year the Minister provided €1.28 million to avoid an adverse impact on the organisations involved. The work that they carry out is invaluable. Organisations such as the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, to name but two, are the umbrella support bodies for many groups such as those which support people with multiple sclerosis, stroke victims and people suffering from dementia. As laid down in the criteria, the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, is a key element of the State's commitment to support the role of the sector in delivering services to enhance the quality of life of many in Ireland and contribute to the creation of a vibrant civil society. Similar to A Vision for Change in the mental health sector, these organisations are endeavouring to help people with a disability to move from residential care to community settings where they can integrate with the community and achieve independence. Neurological organisations which account for 12 of the 23 organisations affected are providing critical front-line services and support for over 700,000 people affected by neurological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injury.Being excluded from SSNO funding means a loss of income of €600,000 which will result in a loss of critical services such as counselling, helpline and home support, vital services that empower people to live in their homes and communities. The withdrawal of SSNO funding will result in potential job losses of one full-time and 11 part-time staff, while two organisations may close. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position on funding for these organisations and confirm the continuation of funding.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the Seanad on the funding scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector and thank the Senator for raising this important issue. The scheme aims to provide multi-annual funding for national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services. During 2013 a review of the scheme was undertaken. It found that while the scheme had fulfilled its main objective of providing multi-annual funding for national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services, there was a need for the organisations funded under the scheme to demonstrate clearly the added value of the work proposed. A new scheme to support national organisations was advertised for applications early last year. The Department requested Pobal to undertake an assessment of the applications received, given that organisation's significant experience and expertise in both the design of assessment criteria and the completion of assessment functions. In this context, Pobal put in place a dedicated team to deal with inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which it is considering. Some 157 applications were received by Pobal. A total of 55 applications were approved for funding in the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. In excess of €8 million is being provided by the Department in the two-year period, representing an increase in funding of more than 10% per annum compared to the previous scheme.  The Government is very mindful of the valuable work undertaken by national organisations in the community and voluntary sector. While it was known that the existing scheme was ending on 30 June 2014 and applications were sought for the new scheme with no guarantee of continued funding, it was clear that organisations had become increasingly dependent on this funding. Against that background, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, announced on 18 July 2014 the allocation of bridging funding of €1.4 million to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations for a 12-month period, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. The Department is engaging with the Department of Health to advance the review. The review has been designed to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and the avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support for organisations working in the sector. I confirm that all organisations in receipt of bridging funding and a number of others were invited to make submissions as part of the review process. It is intended to complete and publish the outcome of the review as soon as possible.

She repeated what I had told her. I want an answer to the question as to whether funding will be continued for these organisations. She referred to an appeals process. The organisations submitted appeals almost 12 months ago, but no decision has been arrived at. Surely it is time the Department pulled out its finger and made a decision on the appeals to let the people concerned know what the position is, as they are caught in limbo where jobs are at risk, yet nobody is giving them an answer. All I hear from the Minister of State is that they were invited to make submissions as part of the review process and that it is intended to publish the outcome of the review as soon as possible, but where does this leave the organisations in question? They do not know whether they will receive funding or whether they will have to close their doors. Somebody needs to provide an answer to their questions quickly.

The level of funding was increased to over €8 million, an increase of 10% in comparison with the allocation for the previous scheme. I undertake to bring the Senator's concerns back to the Department and discuss them with my officials. We will try to provide her with a more detailed response.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	5	I welcome the Minister of State. I wish to outline for her the reason Galway County Council's municipal district of Connemara should be designated as a separate stand-alone lot under the social inclusion programme, SICAP, and to suggest social inclusion funding should be awarded accordingly. The decision taken by the Department, overseen by Galway County Council, has caused uproar in Galway. On 12 March I attended a meeting of 650 people at Maam Cross in Connemara. The decision made at the meeting was to make Galway, including Connemara, one lot for the receipt of funding under the SICAP. Previously it had been divided into two lots. East Galway had come under Galway Rural Development, GRD, and west Galway under Forum Connemara. Galway is the second largest county in the country and east and west Galway are radically different, as I know being a public representative for the county. West Galway, west of Lough Corrib, includes Connemara, while, for the most part, east Galway is a different constituency. I live in east Galway, in the Oranmore electoral division. I am very happy with the services provided by Galway Rural Development which has won this funding, but that does not mean Connemara should not be a stand-alone lot. It is a vast area which contains more than one third of the population of the county. Its terrain and everything else are different. I support Forum Connemara and wish to explain why Connemara should be designated as a stand-alone lot. The proper way to deal with this issue is to divide Galway into two lots, one encompassing the area west of Lough Corrib, Connemara, and the other the east, the GRD area. Unfortunately, this did not happen and for that reason, I call on the Minister to make it happen. I spoke about the meeting I had attended, attended by 650 people, and their disillusionment with the decision which had been made. I have grave concerns about how the local community development committee, LCDC, put the new arrangement in place, through the acting county CEO. It seems to be undemocratic and divisive. There are serious concerns about the way in which the vote on the designation of the SICAP took place, when only five of the 19 people were eligible to vote. Everyone else had a conflict of interest or was absent. This has serious implications for the committee as regards future decisions, not least on the distribution of these funds. On the night of the meeting, with others, I called for a public inquiry into this decision. I understand a judicial review is under way, although I cannot confirm any more this. If Forum Connemara is dismantled in this fashion, will it not also affect the committee's membership and eligibility?  Let me outline some of the benefits to be gained from reviewing the decision. The provision for one lot only in terms of SICAP funding for Galway means social exclusion, not social inclusion, the opposite of what we want to happen. The general view at the meeting was that Forum Connemara was of vital importance to the community in Connemara. There is hardly a person in Connemara who has not had some contact with its services. People told their stories about the value of Forum Connemara to every demographic grouping in Connemara.Young people, sports people and older people spoke. For example, the only working acupuncturist in Connemara started her practice in 2010. She provides a health service for 420 people who are rurally isolated in the area. These are people whom the mainstream health service had been unable to help and for whom travelling to Galway, a distance of possibly 50 or 60 miles, for this service was difficult and expensive. Had it not been for the services of FORUM in Letterfrack, she says she would not be in the position she is in today. She says she received guidance and support in starting a new business from FORUM when Enterprise Ireland in Galway would not even reply to her e-mails or telephone calls. She now pays tax whereas before she drew down jobseeker's allowance and she buys locally and circulates her earnings locally. She says the new arrangement would suggest she would have to travel to Athenry under the GRD-----

This is not only Government policy, it is the policy of local county councillors as well. As part of the programme of reform of local government, local community development committees, LCDCs, have been established in all local authority areas throughout the country. This is not just in Galway.

They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than applied heretofore with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities. There was a tendering process. In accordance with the public spending code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP was subject to a public procurement process, which is in its final stages. In stage 1, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes, for example, smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations, were invited to submit joint applications. The closing date for stage 2, invitation to tender, was 19 December 2014. Tenderers have now been informed of the outcome of their tender and local and community development committees are in the process of finalising contracts with the successful tenderers. LCDCs have managed and implemented stage 2, invitation to tender, of the SICAP tendering process. SICAP was tendered for on the basis of lots. In most areas, this was one lot per local authority area. This reflects Government policy and the alignment process. In some areas, a decision was taken by the LCDC to divide the lot into smaller units. That was a decision of the LCDC in each case. The LCDC and not the Minister made this decision. The LCDC is independent of the local authority in the performance of its functions. This independence is provided for explicitly in sections 49A(2) and 128B(8) of the Local Government Act 2001. Any decision made by an LCDC when carrying out its functions is solely a matter for that LCDC. That said, my Department advised in a letter to all LCDCs in July 2014 that in order to reduce the administrative burden for each LCDC, it would be prudent to have one lot only for each LCDC. I am satisfied that the decision of Galway LCDC to tender on the basis of one lot was taken with probity.

I hear what the Minister of State is saying about national policy. That is not at issue. I accept that the national devolves to local, etc., but the issue here is the way the committee made its decision. It is not putting people first at local level. If it was, this decision would not have been taken, given the vastness of the county and the differences in people's needs in west Galway and east Galway. The general view at the meeting, including that of people who are members of the LCDC committee, is that they did not know on what it was they were voting. That is a serious issue. Does the Minister of State accept how serious it is? Only five out of 19 committee members could cast a vote. How could that be a democratic decision? The view in the room and the view of everyone I am meeting is that the committee process which made the decision was flawed in the first instance. In summing up those circumstances, how can we revisit the LCDC decision in order that people will be informed on the next occasion?

He has a very busy schedule and he did not receive much notice about this matter. I am, therefore, delighted that he is here. I also welcome Mr. Martin Plummer, chairman of the National Chauffeur Drivers Association; Mr. Mick Devine and his son, Shane Devine, who are members of the association and in the Visitors Gallery. I ask the Minister to seriously consider their situation. The National Chauffeur Drivers Association is an independent and non-profit organisation representing the chauffeur-drive industry in Ireland. The association comprises more than 120 chauffeur-drive companies nationwide, with members operating more than 400 high-end vehicles. They perform an ambassadorial role for Ireland because they meet business people, as well as representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and tourism interests coming to Ireland. They present a very positive side of Ireland, its people and its culture. I congratulate Mr. Mick Devine on receiving an international award for his work in that regard. He has driven luminaries such as Bruce Springsteen and others who are great ambassadors for Ireland. Regular clients include guests of the Government, trade delegations, diplomats and leading business executives. The NCDA also has strong links with many important groups in the commercial and tourism sectors. Its members are regularly called on by the Government, Departments and leading businesses to service visitors in a professional, positive and welcoming manner. I was a guest in Taiwan and the airline, Emirates, provided chauffeur driven cars to collect clients at Dublin Airport to fly on to the Middle East and onwards to Taiwan and elsewhere. They are providing great employment opportunities. On the way back from the airport we were stopped by a member of An Garda Síochána who reminded the driver that he could go only certain ways as we drove down O'Connell Street. He was not in the bus lane. That is the background. I could not believe people performing such a service, working for airlines on tight schedules, cannot use empty bus lines going to the airport. They are dealing with prominent business people coming here with the major international companies. Nine of the ten largest companies in the world are here, including Google, and they require speedy access to business meetings with Ministers, the Government and business contacts. After the Minister makes his point, I will present the document to him, but I do not have time to outline all of the points today. In summary, he is a progressive Minister, which everybody accepts. When the late Seamus Brennan was Minister, he was on the verge of granting the concession to paid-up members who paid the full fees. In this modern Ireland, they should be granted this concession to drive in bus lanes when appropriate. They would not necessarily use them on every occasion but when required and it is an option they should have at their disposal. I would like the Minister to take up the case. He has other issues on his desk, including Aer Lingus, and while this may not be a priority it is a priority for members who came to listen to the words of the Minister. We hope they will get some encouragement in this regard. There are no objections from other organisations in this regard. This is a niche market providing great employment opportunities and those involved are great ambassadors in my experience. I was driven by two of the members from the airport when going out and coming back to Taiwan and their manner was positive as far as Ireland is concerned. In this regard, I would appreciate it if the Minister considered their case for using bus lanes.

I am pleased to come to the Chamber to respond and acknowledge representatives of the industry in the Visitors Gallery. I see Senator Terry Brennan also has guests in the Visitors Gallery. They are all welcome. The legislation governing the usage of bus lanes is set out in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, as amended. Under this legislation, buses and bicycles are allowed to avail of bus lanes, as are taxis in the case of with-flow bus lanes only. The rationale for introducing this legislation, and for creating the bus lane network itself, was to provide on-street priority for bus-based public transport. The intention is to make bus services both faster and more reliable, thereby attracting more people out of private cars and onto public transport. This, in turn, helps to reduce both congestion and pollution. The construction of the bus lane network was done at some expense and inconvenience to the public in order to enable this to happen. Cyclists are permitted to use bus lanes because they are inherently vulnerable road users and would be safer in bus lanes than in general traffic. Initially, taxis were not allowed into bus lanes. It was only some time after the introduction of the lanes that it was agreed to allow taxis to use them. This was done only after much consideration, and was a concession based on the fact that taxis are available for on-street hire. Limousines, of course, are not. Vehicles used by members of the emergency services - the Garda, fire brigade and ambulance service - in the course of their duties may also be driven in bus lanes, in order to prevent delay in reaching the scenes of emergencies and in getting people to hospital. Since the introduction of the bus lane network, my Department has received numerous requests to open bus lanes to other classes of road user. These have included requests relating to motorcycles, hackneys, and multi-occupancy cars. The issue of access for limousines has also been raised from time to time over the years. In all cases, my predecessors and I have taken the view that extending the use of bus lanes to other categories of vehicle would undermine the original purpose of these laws. The overriding concern in considering these applications is the carrying capacity of bus lanes. We do not want their primary role of providing bus priority to be undermined by allowing other vehicles access. As a result, my predecessors and I have chosen to maintain the current restrictions on use of bus lanes. While in some cases the numbers of vehicles involved might not be large, conceding access to bus lanes to any new class of vehicles would make it difficult to argue against doing so for any other. In light of the original reasons for creating bus lanes, and the sound reasons for rejecting previous applications, I remain of the view that there is no ground for changing the law to allow limousines into bus lanes. The Senator made the point that other organisations do not have an issue with this. I imagine they would be quite supportive of it happening because once any new class of vehicle comes in, it sets a precedent for arguing that more vehicles should be included. In the near future, I hope to see the number of buses in our country increase and that will mean even more demand for use of the bus lanes, which, in turn, makes it more difficult to allow other vehicles in. The Senator has some documentation and information on the matter he has raised and I am happy to take it from him on the completion of this debate.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	25	In a sense, I am disappointed but this is the start of the campaign. As a former Minister of State, I know the Minister has set a certain precedent and he has not had the opportunity to study this in detail. I hope he does so in due course. Chauffeur driven cars will not stop in a bus lane, unlike taxis that may pick up passengers. Chauffeurs go straight through with no delay and they add a certain prestige to the whole process of promoting Ireland. Many other issues are involved and we have prestigious business people coming in. In addition, Emirates Airlines and others are using chauffeur driven cars in Dublin. They are providing much employment. From a transport and other points of view, this does not require new legislation but a ministerial order. Perhaps we could do this as a test run and make the concession to chauffeur driven cars during certain busy periods of the year such as summer months in a pilot scheme to see how it would operate in reality. Would it affect traffic flow? Not many cars are involved and it is not a case of liberalising the entire situation. I will leave it open and say nothing further because the Minister has a liberal approach to ministerial responsibility. In due course and after consideration and meeting representatives, the Minister may look at this issue afresh.

My challenge about this matter is not just how the limousine owners or its representatives will respond.The measure proposed would set a precedent in the use of bus lanes by other vehicles.  I am confident that bus lanes will become busier as more people use bus transport and more buses are supplied to respond to higher demand.  I do not wish to change the priority afforded to buses and taxis in bus lanes.  As I indicated, I will be pleased to receive any information the Senator may have on the issue raised by him.

The company's starting point two years ago was that there was only one show in town, namely, the use of overhead lines and pylons to run new cables across the Golden Vale, through counties Waterford, Wexford and Kildare and across the west.  The State company has now indicated that it can generate sufficient energy and power through the existing network by using new technologies.  Some 35,000 people made submissions on the proposed Grid25 route from County Cork to County Kildare, a large number of whom live in my community.    Having conducted some research on this matter, I have learned that EirGrid will make its submission to the independent expert panel for its consideration.  I ask the Minister to outline what the timescale for the panel's deliberations will be and when it will produce an interim report or make an announcement.  It was established following considerable public discourse and activity, including protests and, as the Minister will recall, a high profile meeting of the Labour Party on the issue in Killarney attended by approximately 100 Deputies, Senators and councillors.  I was pleased that this meeting moved the Minister's predecessor to establish the independent expert panel in January 2014.  After 15 months of deliberations, the expert group has not, to the best of my knowledge, presented a report. While the number of representations made to me declined this week as people read reports on EirGrid's plans, I was asked many times last week about the independent expert panel's report.    In the hierarchy of things, the Minister will have received a report from EirGrid setting out how it wishes to proceed. The independent review panel obviously has a different status from the company and most people are awaiting its report on the issue.  I raise this issue in an effort to glean some information from the Minister.   With others, I made representations on behalf of the affected communities, to which the Minister and his predecessor responded.  This is what democracy is about and last week's announcement was a good one for people involved in this issue nationwide.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	28	I thank the Senator for his remarks.  I understand he framed his question prior to last Friday.  He will understand, therefore, that in my initial remarks I will respond to his question, as framed, and that we may have an opportunity for a further exchange thereafter.    The independent expert panel was established in January 2014 to oversee preparation by EirGrid of comprehensive, route specific studies and reports on fully underground and overhead options for the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  The studies and reports are to include assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors.  I am advised that EirGrid submitted a report on the Grid West project to the panel in early February 2015.  The report identifies two overhead line options and one underground cable option.  These options were also referred to in EirGrid's recently published strategy.  That report was considered by the panel at its most recent meeting on 24 February.  I understand the panel sought further information on certain parts of the report and will engage with EirGrid in the coming weeks in that regard.  I am advised that the panel expects to be in a position to provide me with an opinion on the Grid West project in April.  With regard to the Grid Link project, the panel expects to be in a position to provide me with an opinion on the project in the third quarter of the year.  The opinions provided for me by the panel will address the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports.  The panel will also oversee publication of the reports by EirGrid prior to the company proceeding to public consultation on the two projects.  I draw attention, as the Senator did, to EirGrid's new draft strategy entitled, Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow, which was published on Friday, 27 March.  The draft is shaped by three key pillars, namely, open engagement with communities; making the most of new technologies; and a commitment to make the existing grid work harder before building new transmission infrastructure.  The draft strategy which reviews the Grid Link, Grid West and North-South transmission line projects highlights how Ireland's energy transmission needs can be met in light of updated projections of future electricity demand.  It points to technological developments which, if adopted, could reduce the overall need for additional transmission grid infrastructure.  The paper confirms the need to reinforce the transmission system in the south east but suggests an alternative to the original Grid Link proposal which would involve upgrading existing transmission lines rather than building new ones. It also puts forward a new option for Grid West which would significantly reduce the amount of new overhead cable required.  It reaffirms the need for the North-South project.

I assume the independent expert panel is required to submit its reports to the Minister before the proposed projects can proceed or another round of consultations can take place. I ask the Minister to clarify the position in that regard. EirGrid has indicated it will engage in public consultations on its draft strategy entitled, Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow. I respectfully request that the Minister speak in forceful terms to the company about how it intends to engage with local communities. I will cite a brief example of EirGrid's previous engagement.In my town, Carrick-on-Suir, an eminent professional went to seek information pertinent to where he lived. He put a series of questions to the EirGrid representatives and, unhappy with the answers he had received, returned in the evening, met a different official and received a different series of answers from those he had received in the morning from the same company. That is completely unacceptable.

It is not insignificant that negotiations with Great Britain on the memorandum of understanding to export wind energy supplies are dead in the water and not going to go ahead. The rush to provide infrastructure to avail of wind farms across the country is history because there will be no sale across the water. Therefore, I welcome the introduction of the technology, but the number of power lines needed has abated drastically. I would like to see a recognition of this. On the wind set-back guidelines-----

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	36	The first point concerns how the new EirGrid draft strategy will fit with the work of the expert panel. The review identifies three potential options for Grid Link and four possible solutions for Grid West. It is a draft document for public consultation and, as I said, there are three potential options for Grid Link, one of which the Senator regards as preferable. The consultation process can facilitate that response. EirGrid will continue its evaluation of the options with a view to making a submission to the independent expert panel. It will be required to and will balance the wider economic, environmental and technical considerations and, most importantly, the views of industry, policy makers and the people to find the best outcomes. On foot of its consideration of EirGrid's submission, the independent expert panel will submit a report to me which, to reassure the Senator, will be followed by a further round of public consultations. There is evidence that EirGrid has much improved its engagement with communities and the public and in a recent report it recognised some shortcomings in that aspect of its work in recent years. It has taken significant and commendable steps to address the issue. I would be upset if individuals who engaged with it were not satisfied with the responses received or received inconsistent responses. I would like that issue to be addressed and I am sure it will be. In terms of the exports initiative, I would not describe it as dead in the water or complete history, the term used by the Senator. The project will not go ahead and I do not believe there is any prospect of a similar project going ahead in the near to mid-term but, looking to 2020 and beyond, there are possibilities and potential for the future. Even if there is no potential for exports, we still need to continue to make progress and up our game in the renewables sector. Onshore wind energy projects will be one aspect but not the only one. The necessity to increase the use of renewables and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels will continue, but we should do so in a prudent way and only build infrastructure when it is necessary do so. I agree with the Senator on that point and EirGrid has made an assessment of what is necessary. Let us not build infrastructure unless it is absolutely required and let us have regard to the needs, wishes and views of communities. Both imperatives are reflected in its recent report, for which it is to be commended. This was reflected in my discussions with it in recent months.

Approximately 300 gardaí have undertaken their training of 104 weeks in total, with 32 weeks in Templemore. I am alarmed as I am dealing with a couple of cases at the moment in which the Department of Social Protection is refusing these trainee gardaí family income supplement, FIS. I believe the Department is in breach of three very clear statutory instruments that are long standing. The chief superintendent of the college in Templemore has also been assisting trainee guards who are now employed by the Department of Justice and Equality, are paying tax and USC and are earning €182 per week gross during their training. Many of these gardaí genuinely cannot afford to feed their families because of the stance the Department of Social Protection is taking. The Department's answer is that "student gardaí are full-time students doing a B.A. in advanced policing and are not employees". The FIS section has put that in bold in its response to me. This is the fourth time I have written to it. However, according to the Department of Justice and Equality, these gardaí are employees of the Department of Justice and Equality and completing their training to become fully-attested gardaí. I know the Leader of the House is very familiar with this issue. It is not an acceptable situation. I have been corresponding with the Department for the guts of eight or ten weeks and have gotten nowhere and am asking for the Leader's assistance and that of other colleagues, particularly on the Government side, in raising this matter with the Minister for Social Protection. It involves a small number of gardaí. I have spoken to one garda with three young kids. The bank has given him a mortgage holiday for the period of his training. People are making a lot of sacrifice to become gardaí and are certainly not doing it for financial gain. I would have thought the State should give them some support. This is an anomaly and the FIS section within the Department is taking a very hard line on it. I ask the Leader's assisance in raising the matter with the Minister and getting it resolved quickly. As regards the Fennelly report and investigation into the resignation or retirement of the former Garda Commissioner, the cloak of the Bailey case has now been disposed of so there should be no impediment to the Taoiseach informing us as to whether he was recalled by Fennelly to answer queries about the original evidence he gave to the investigation. I still do not understand why the Taoiseach will not himself now make a clear statement as to his role that evening and what he asked the former Secretary General to say to the former Garda Commissioner. Did he overstep his own statutory powers by directing the former Commissioner of An Garda Síochána to effectively resign? These are very serious issues and there is no reason the Taoiseach cannot answer these questions. I know he does not want the report published before the general election and is just trying to kick it down the road. My colleagues and I in Fianna Fáil find it completely unacceptable.It would be appropriate for the Taoiseach to make a statement on this matter to clear it up. In that regard, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Taoiseach come to the House to make a statement to clarify whether he was recalled by Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly to answer queries on the original evidence and outline what he said to the Secretary General and the message he asked the Secretary General to relay to the former Garda Commissioner. There is no legal impediment on the Taoiseach in addressing these matters. All he is trying to do is hide behind this investigation.

This will come as a welcome boost to the Government's campaign to lobby the European Commission to ensure the spending limits will be lifted to some extent. I note the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's position that the current spending limits set by the European Union are far more constraining than required due to the averaging out over the ten year period. This is very welcome news. I heard the chair of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council say this morning that he thought there should be a positive reception at the European Union for the Government's lobbying campaign and the good news on that matter coincides with the figures published today on unemployment showing that unemployment had reduced to 10% for the first time since early 2009 and that 90,000 jobs had been created since the Government's Action Plan for Jobs in 2012. Many of us have asked the Leader for debates on job creation and unemployment. We might have a debate on that again in due course because it is a good news story that needs to be highlighted. We need to speak about it again, particularly after the Government's economic statement scheduled for the end of this month. I ask for a debate also on policing in the light of the welcome announcement today by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, that the Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has sanctioned the recruitment of 250 new recruits to the Garda. I listened to Senator Darragh O'Brien speak on that issue, but it is worth noting the welcome increase in Garda recruits. There are 300 new recruits-----

It is welcome also to see the positive reporting, particularly in the wake of the murder trial last week and the excellent policing practice that goes on in this country. At the domestic violence conference I spoke about earlier this week, there was also a recognition and acknowledgement of the excellent practices going on in some quarters in the Garda on policing of domestic violence. I remind colleagues that we have a Labour Private Members' motion tonight on integration with the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. It commends the Minister for the work he has done to date with new communities and in particular highlighting last week's inaugural PolskaÉire Festival 2015, which was hugely successful. As there will be people from that festival in the Visitors Gallery, I hope colleagues will participate.

Carol Coulter and her team are providing an invaluable service for us. As one of the issues highlighted in the reports is the lack of specialised mental health services for children, I reiterate my call for a debate on children's mental health services. We are seeing far too many reports published showing where we have failed. I would like to have a debate in this House to allow us determine what can be done and how we can ensure children will get the mental health services as they need them, not a long time after we have failed the system. The second issue I want to raise is one I had put down as a Commencement matter and I ask the Leader not to ask me to do that because it was ruled out of order. It concerns the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 which is stalled on Committee Stage in the Dáil since December 2013. Today, 1 April, marks the launch by Inclusion Ireland and a coalition of disability groups of the Fool Me Once campaign to repeal the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. It is a 144 year old Victorian law that defines people with mental health difficulties as idiots, lunatics and of unsound mind. The campaign has attracted 2,000 signatories to date and remains open for the rest of the week. With regard to some of the comments people made about the reason they felt so strongly about this issue, one parent stated, "As a parent of 3 children on the spectrum I’m appalled at this bill. It’s outdated, inhumane and it needs to be scrapped immediately." Another stated, "A change long overdue! My son is not a 'lunatic'! It's a 19th century law for people living in the 21st century." Another signatory stated, "I have a sister who suffers with Down's Syndrome. The idea that the law can refer to her as an Idiot or a Lunatic makes my blood boil! This is disgusting and needs to be changed ASAP." I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, older people, equality and mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to come into the House to answer these questions. Will the 2013 Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill be enacted before the general election? Why has the Bill remained at Committee Stage for so long, and what is the likely timeframe for Ireland to incorporate the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities into Irish law, which is long overdue? Families are living with this archaic, Victorian law. We need to progress this legislation and I ask the Leader to do everything in his power to ensure that happens. I welcome Raheny Girl Guides to the Visitors Gallery.

That brings the total since September to 550, which is a very welcome development. We all know the pressure on Garda numbers and this news is very much to be welcomed. The Government recognises the pressures and the Minister has committed to never closing Templemore College again, as was done by the previous Government. I note also that the Investec manufacturing PMI study out today also records strong improvement in March. That is helped by a record high rate of employment and has led to a sharp increase in output, with strong new orders. It is noted that operating conditions have improved in each of the past 22 months. That strong manufacturing growth is supported by rising domestic and export business. It is clear that while many difficult decisions have been made, the results are now bearing fruit. The economy is expanding at a significant rate and the tax take is up. That is allowing us to provide services such as increasing the number of Garda recruits. The rising tide is not based on property. It is based on a more stable approach which is spread over a wide range of areas in the economy. I ask the Leader, in view of the forthcoming spring statement, to ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to come before the Seanad because it would be an opportune time to discuss the economy. The spring statement will be an outline of the way the economy will grow on a sustainable basis in the years to come.

It is time Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly's interim report was published. It would be useful to do this in the interests of everybody, including the Taoiseach. I do not believe the rumours about the Taoiseach having shafted the then Garda Commissioner are useful. Whether they are true or not, we need to get the facts of the matter and the people are entitled to it. Announcements of additional gardaí being recruited will not cover the fact that people yearn for that and are entitled to it. I also ask for a debate on public sector pay. The Government may have plans for a forum in this regard, and we look forward to participating in it, but many of the reductions in the public service in terms of pay and conditions in recent years were seen as temporary. Now, as things are beginning to improve, it is only fair that the squeezed middle would be looked after in some way. There is much celebration, particularly on the Labour Party benches, with regard to the 250 Garda recruits announced and the 300 completing their training in Templemore but all of those are being paid 35% less than the average industrial wage. That is a possible subject for a motion at the Labour Party conference. These people are our best and brightest. Are they not entitled to the same rates of pay as their superiors and equals? It is clear that some are more equal than others. The same applies to teachers and nurses. The cost of living has increased in many instances. The cost of rents has certainly increased and we expect these people to work for 30% to 35% less than the average industrial wage. If there is an improvement in the national coffers, if unemployment levels are falling and things are so good that we have to have Private Members' motions this evening and every other evening commending the Minister of the day for their superior action on behalf of all of us, surely the people on the front line are entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. As that is not the position, I hope the Labour Party and Fine Gael can deal with this issue.Young gardaí, teachers, nurses and civil servants all over the country have been squeezed in the middle. Now that they are seeing much debate and celebration by the Taoiseach and senior Government Ministers as to the State's perceived recovery, they are wondering when it will visit their door. I think they are entitled to know.

We saw fantastic work being done before Christmas concerning the homeless in this city and other cities. Today I am pleased to acknowledge and welcome the next phase of this work, which is tackling local authority housing waiting lists. Through building, buying and leasing, the Government will spend €1.5 billion which will reduce housing waiting lists by 25%. In one action we will see a massive reduction in waiting lists. In my own county of Tipperary alone, we will see 832 new houses either built, leased or bought at a cost of €57 million. Some 832 families will have their own homes for the first time. This is a massive development which I warmly welcome from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. Not alone will this development provide houses, but it will also provide the stimulus that has been spoken about by all parties in this House for many years. It will directly create jobs for builders and builders' providers - the breakfast roll men. This is a good news story which should be welcomed across the House.

This is despite the fact that the Garda met the Taoiseach in his constituency office prior to Christmas. These are serious allegations. I am reluctant to say this because I think the Taoiseach is a nice man personally, but it is quite obvious now that he is refusing to answer direct questions that are being put to him. He is doing it on a regular basis with our own party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, and he was at it again yesterday. It was quite obvious from looking at the exchanges between the Taoiseach and Deputy Mick Wallace that he did not even attempt to address the specific questions being put to him. We also have the Fennelly report. Several months ago, I gave the House information that had come to me that an early morning phone call was made to the former Garda Commissioner Callanan by the Secretary General of the Department under the direct instructions of the Taoiseach, which prompted his resignation. These are also serious allegations that need to be teased out. It is incumbent upon the Taoiseach to attend this, the Upper House of the Oireachtas. It is not enough for him to hide behind his vast majority in the Lower House. He should answer questions that will be put to him here.  I also want to raise the issue of variable mortgage interest rates, which our leader, Senator Darragh O'Brien, raised here yesterday. What is the point of the Government, which represents the State, owning 99% of one of the major pillar banks and 15% of the other pillar bank? Yesterday, when our colleague Deputy Michael McGrath raised a motion on the variable mortgage rate issue, a junior Minister told the Dáil that the Government had no role. What are the directors doing there? They are supposed to be there in the interests of the people of Ireland. Even on a commercial basis, as directors in the State interest, they are holding a 15% equity in one bank and a 99% in another bank, but do they have any influence at all in the boardroom? Are they just turning up for the tea and biscuits?

It is good news for the young people involved, as they will now get good jobs in An Garda Síochána. It will also mean a lot for the security and policing of our State at difficult times. In addition, it will bring the force up to that magical figure of 13,000. I also welcome the news that milk quotas will now be abolished, which will create up to an estimated 1,000 jobs. Over the past 30 years, people have not had the chance to expand production because of milk quotas. However, dairy farmers are currently making a huge investment in dairy programmes for the future. The abolition of quotas will create more jobs and will provide an opportunity to export more output from our growing agri-food business. All in all, therefore, it is good news for the agriculture sector.

It is a shame and a scandal that nobody has been found guilty of the manslaughter/murder of Fr. Molloy in Kilcoursey House, Clara, in 1985. The current Government gave commitments to the family of Fr. Molloy, prior to the general election, that there would be a full sworn inquiry into the tragic death of Fr. Molloy, but this did not take place. The outcome of the report by Mr. Dominic McGinn, SC, states there will be no further inquires into the controversial death of Fr. Molloy. That is not acceptable to the families, however, who feel that justice should be done and be seen to be done. I followed up this matter at the time and met Judge Frank Roe who was president of the Circuit Court. The judge, who is now deceased, directed the jury not to find a particular person guilty of manslaughter, even though he himself was a personal friend. A lot of issues arose-----

It should also be borne in mind that Fianna Fáil was not in government at that particular time - it was a coalition Government. There is an implication that a senior member of Fianna Fáil was at the wedding. He was with his wife, but they left on 7 July. They were not there on the day that Fr. Molloy was murdered or died tragically.

I suppose the question really is what are they there for? We like to think they are there to defend the public interest, but is that the reality, or are they there as directors to defend the banks' balance sheets and, ultimately, the bottom line? There is a little bit of schizophrenia going on here. On the one hand, we want the banks to return to profitability in order that they can repay us, the shareholders, the money we have pumped into them. There is a real issue that needs to be discussed. Do we need to change the role of the directors of the banks in question?This would require a change in the legislation. Interest rates is only one of the issues that needs to be raised with the Minister for Finance and debated. The Taoiseach this morning called on the banks to pass on reductions in interest rates but again, that is a request as opposed to an instruction. There is a real issue there for us as to what is the role of these directors and who are they there to serve. If we want banks to pass on lower interest rates and if this is going to have an impact on the bottom line, are we prepared to say we are willing to accept that when it comes to ultimately what amount of money is to be repaid to us and how quickly it will be repaid? I find it deeply frustrating when I think of the number of times I have stood up here to ask for a debate on banking but we have not as yet had that debate. A number of issues could be debated, not least the issue of the banks, interest rates, mortgage arrears and the whole issue of the Central Bank caps and so forth. This debate needs to happen. I ask the Leader to please pursue that request with the Minister for Finance specifically and no one else. I welcome the announcement this morning of the €1.5 billion allocated to every local authority in the country, along with targets for the delivery of the social housing programme. I am delighted to see an allocation to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, my own local area, to cover nearly 700 housing units. I join calls from all sides of the House for a full and more robust debate on the issue of housing and the construction sector generally.
#CaitKeane	unknown-#CaitKeane-party	unknown-#CaitKeane-dob	unknown-#CaitKeane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	58	Like all other Senators, I welcome the recruitment of 550 new gardaí since last September. The first recruitment drive since 2009 began in 2013. This is a welcome increase in Garda numbers because we need gardaí and they need proper facilities and services, as well as extra numbers. I raise and call for a debate on the issue of jury service and those who are called to serve on juries. In a recent case the jury served for more than four months. Certain categories of people are excused from jury service, for example, Oireachtas staff, local authority staff, HSE staff, harbour authorities staff, doctors, dentists and chemists, over a range of occupations, but these are all State jobs as opposed to private sector jobs. This has always been the practice. Jurors are not paid for doing jury service. However, not alone are people out of pocket, but they may also have to pay for child care for many weeks and months. I ask for a debate on this issue. Some years ago the Law Reform Commission asked for a review of the voluntary aspect of jury service and whether expenses should be paid to jurors. At least we should discuss the issue to see if this would be possible. It is not fair on self-employed and those employed in the private sector. People lose opportunities for job promotion while they are away on jury service for a lengthy period. Jurors are chosen from the electoral register at random. The Law Reform Commission suggested that the methodology of selection of jurors should include the electoral register for local and European elections in order to allow long-term residents of the State to participate in the jury system. It is only fair that every resident would be entitled to be represented on juries.
#LorraineHiggins	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-party	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-dob	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	59	I welcome the news yesterday that the Garda Commissioner, Nóirín O'Sullivan, speaking at the annual conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, said an investigation was under way into the intimidation and harassment on social media of members of the public and gardaí. This is brilliant news for many adults and children the length and breadth of the country who have been exposed to sustained and sometimes orchestrated campaigns of abuse online. This issue has been allowed to fester because of the lack of clear legislation in this area. The Commissioner's commitment is particularly important because, in my experience, social media companies have shirked their responsibilities entirely when it comes to providing a duty of care to their users. This has been made abundantly clear to me in recent days because only last week I wrote to Twitter and Facebook as a result of the inordinate number of messages that I received from people who have been subjected to online abuse. I have asked these social media companies to confirm how many complaints they have received, the length of time it has taken them to investigate these complaints and how many of these complaints have been referred by them to An Garda Síochána. To date, they have failed, refused and-or neglected to provide me with this information. Their reluctance to acknowledge any duty of care whatsoever to their users is quite baffling. Despite the fact that they have the benefit of a favourable tax rate in this country, it is about time that they showed some corporate social responsibility and at the very least, responded to specific questions and quitted their powder puff PR spin. I commend the Garda Commissioner for taking action in attempting to bring some degree of decency back to online discourse. I urge her to ensure there is cross-Border co-operation between the policing forces to ensure people can be brought to task for the kind of vile vitriolic messages being posted online and that they face penalties and sanctions. I ask the Leader to set aside time to discuss and debate this matter with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	60	I raise the issue of the housing budget. I welcome the announcement that in Cork city and county over €205 million has been allocated for the period 2015-17. It is very welcome that an extra 2,500 houses or apartments will be built and made available. However, I have concerns about the ability of local authorities to be able to respond to the funding. My concern arises with regard to Cork City Council which was allocated over €10 million last year for regeneration in the north-west area of Cork city but over €5 million of that allocation was not used. It is extremely important that in allocating this funding appropriate actions are taken to ensure the funding is being spent appropriately and delivered on time. There needs to be a mechanism between the Department and the local authorities in order that if local authorities are not delivering action will be taken. This allocation over three years is very welcome because allocation from year to year is no longer acceptable as it does not allow local authorities to undertake long-term planning. However, the checks and balances need to be in place at an early stage. I wish to raise an issue which I have raised previously which is the cost of medical insurance for those practising medicine. There is a concern that a number of people are retiring from practice because of the cost of medical insurance. I met the Medical Protection Society this morning on this matter which the society has been raising for more than one year. For example, the cost of insurance for an orthopaedic consultant is over €104,000 per annum. This amounts to €2,000 a week for professional indemnity insurance. The capping levels need to be looked at. If people are forced out of practising medicine in the private sector there will be more people looking for service in the public sector which does not have the staffing levels to deal with that increase in workload. I ask the Leader that this matter be brought to the attention of the Minister and that appropriate action be taken by the Government in order to assist all those involved in medical practice in order that the cost of medical indemnity insurance is lowered. This needs to be done urgently.
#RonanMullen	unknown-#RonanMullen-party	unknown-#RonanMullen-dob	unknown-#RonanMullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	61	I ask for a debate with the Minister for Finance about how the State Claims Agency defends litigation involving the State, in particular, the need to avoid unnecessary court cases. Guidelines may be needed. The State Claims Agency handles much of the litigation where the State is concerned.The agency is actually the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, operating under a different guise. The NTMA reports directly to the Minister for Finance on the performance of its State Claims Agency functions. I request a debate with the Minister on this matter and the need to put guidelines in place, particularly in the light of the experience of one family in County Kerry whose case was highlighted in the media recently. The family's son was born at Kerry General Hospital in May 2006 and, tragically, suffered a severe brain injury at birth. He has cerebral palsy and is completely dependent on others for all of his daily needs. The family which recently reached an interim €2.8 million settlement with the Health Service Executive, HSE, states the consultant who delivered their child met them shortly after his birth, apologised for what had happened and cried with them. However, it was not until February that the HSE admitted liability. The boy's mother said the attitude adopted by the HSE had caused huge stress to the family and resulted in a long legal battle. In turn, the HSE indicated that the State Claims Agency, not it, made decisions on the legal approach taken in such cases. It also stated it did not know why it had taken so long for a settlement to be reached and that it had a policy of open disclosure at the earliest opportunity whereby it would admit liability in cases of wrongdoing. In many instances there is a clear tort leader which gives rise to liability on the part of a hospital. In such cases the only legal issue to be determined is the extent of damages or the level of compensation to be awarded. This can be done in an application to the High Court to measure damages where liability is not an issue. Clear guidelines governing the manner in which the State Claims Agency approaches cases in which there is clear liability and this has been acknowledged by the HSE and the hospitals involved must be put in place. The HSE and hospitals should not be allowed to withhold an admission of liability as a negotiating tactic in circumstances where there is an implicit threat to the family. It should not be a case of people being told, "Accept our offer of damages or risk a court case". It is unseemly for a State agency to treat families in the manner I have outlined, particularly where there is the option of using the relatively non-adversarial procedure of asking the High Court to measure damages. In many cases families seek only an apology and funds to allow them to offer long-term care to their disabled children. Such families should not be put through the wringer by any State agency. It is clear that guidelines are necessary. I would appreciate it if we could engage in a debate with the Minister on this specific issue.

This development will allow many jobs to be created throughout the country, not just in particular areas. Ongoing and valid criticism to the effect that employment was limited to certain locations in the past has been levelled at the Government and those which preceded it. Jobs will be created in every parish and county throughout the land. Another issue I want to raise relates to the allocation of €1.5 billion in funding for the provision of social housing. It is about time such funding was provided. I am not going to criticise what happened in the past, particularly as money was not available. However, money is being made available now. Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to come to the House to explain how the funding is being allocated? I have just examined the numbers and wish to make it clear that I am not very pleased. I could only scratch my head when I discovered that certain counties or constituencies were receiving half of what was being given to counties and constituencies with similar populations. I have been very critical of the way Fianna Fáil did business when it was in government. The way in which that party did business was that a Minister would look after those in his or her neck of the woods and everybody else could just shag off. The current Government comprises Fine Gael and the Labour Party and that is not the way we do business. However, what is happening in the allocations to which I refer seems to indicate that we are, in fact, doing it in that way. Members will note from my tone that I am very displeased. I will inform the House why that is the case. Under the allocations that have been announced, County Wexford where I live will receive €25 million, while County Tipperary where the Minister resides will receive €57 million. I would like the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, to come to the House at the first available opportunity to explain the numbers to me. What is being done in the context of the numbers smacks of the way in which Fianna Fáil used to do business.

That said, however, I seek a debate on housing, particularly in the context of what Senator Colm Burke said about expenditure. The funding to which Senator Michael D'Arcy and I refer is being allocated for new builds, long-term leasing arrangements and the purchasing of houses. I am confident that the CEO and director of services of Kerry County Council will ensure the money which has been allocated will be spent prudently. However, I still believe there is a need for a debate on the issue. On many occasions I have raised the issue of staff levels at Muckross House. I am glad to announce that funding has been made available for the recruitment of eight new guides. I take the opportunity to thank the Leader and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, for their interventions. I also thank the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who was ultimately responsible for making the funding to which I refer available.

I wish to utter two quick sentences.  I welcome the announcement made by EirGrid on Friday. Is it not wonderful that when the people rise up and make their thoughts known, things happen? However, there are questions to be answered. The project to link Dunnstown, County Kildare with County Wexford was supposed to cost €500 million. Now, however, Californian and Russian involvement means that it will cost half that amount. I am seeking a debate after Easter with the relevant Minister on EirGrid's new findings, the north west and Dunnstown to Cork lines, the plans envisaged and the public consultation process that will take place. I do not know whether any Senator was in Buswells Hotel yesterday, but if there was, he or she will know that there is much to be contemplated and discussed in the context of the future of the country and its energy grid.

Senator Darragh O'Brien referred to student gardaí in Templemore and their inability to obtain family income supplement. As he correctly pointed out, these students are paying tax and the USC. There appears to be a need for joined-up thinking by the Departments of Justice and Equality and Social Protection in this matter. I will bring the Senator's concerns to the attention of the relevant Ministers. The Fennelly report has not yet been published, but I am sure the House will engage in a debate on it when it does emerge. The Taoiseach has outlined that under the Commissions of Investigation Act, he is constrained in commenting. That is and will remain his position.

He is not in a position to sack anyone else. I am sure we will engage in a debate on the report when it is published. Senator Ivana Bacik referred to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and its support for the Government's efforts in Europe. She also welcomed the fact that the unemployment rate had dropped to 10%. The level of unemployment has fallen for 40 consecutive months. The Senator also requested a debate on policing and welcomed the announcement that 250 additional Garda recruits would be taken on in the coming months. Several other Senators also alluded to this matter. The announcement means that the total number of new Garda recruits in the past 12 months now stands at 550, which is certainly a step in the right direction. I agree with the Senator that on many occasions we have all been quick to condemn the Garda for engaging in certain practices. We should applaud the force for the excellent policing practices for which it has been commended, particularly in the past week or so. Senator Jillian van Turnhout spoke about specialised mental health services and called for repeal of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871, which I agree is archaic and Victorian. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will be in the House from 4 p.m. until 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 April and a debate will take place on that occasion. Senator Hildegarde Naughton spoke about the new Garda recruits. She also noted that the recovering economy was allowing us to provide many more opportunities, services and jobs. These are the benefits of a recovering economy. Senator Marc MacSharry called for a debate on the issue of public service pay. We will have that debate. The Low Pay Commission is being set up to ensure people will be treated favourably. I agree totally with the Senator in respect of those in the squeezed middle, which is why the Minister for Finance made alterations in the last budget to help them. He will continue to do so in the budget to be announced next October. Senator Denis Landy spoke about the local authority housing programme. Many Members have alluded to the significant grants provided for various local authorities which are to be welcomed by all. The sum of €1.5 billion is sizeable and would provide for the provision of up to 800 houses in my local authority area. It will be welcomed by everyone on a housing list.  Senator Paschal Mooney spoke about the whistleblower's allegations. The Taoiseach wrote to Deputy Mick Wallace asking for details of what he had said, but he did not reply to him.

I have said this before. It is not something I like saying, but it is a constitutional fact. Senators Michael Comiskey and Michael D'Arcy welcomed the announcement on milk quotas. It can only be good news for farmers and rural Ireland, in particular. It will lead to the creation of a large number of jobs where they are needed and provide great opportunities for the farming sector.  Senator Terry Leyden referred to the case of Fr. Niall Molloy. I have not read the report and do not wish to comment on it.  Senator Aideen Hayden referred to the need for a debate on the banking sector. She has asked for such a debate on a number of occasions and stated she wants the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to come to the House for it. I have made several requests, but, as I am sure everyone will agree, the Minister has been elsewhere in Europe on many occasions and only came back from America yesterday. I will renew my representations to have a debate on the banking sector.  I note Senator Cáit Keane's points and call for a debate on the issue of jury service. I am sure the justice committee will also take up the matter.  Senator Lorraine Higgins welcomed the statement of the Garda Commissioner on the intimidation of gardaí and members of the public on social media. I agree that social media outlets have a duty of care to their users and will ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, to come to the House to debate the matter.  Senator Colm Burke mentioned the allocation of €205 million for more than 2,500 housing units in Cork. I agree with him that appropriate measures should be taken to ensure these units will be delivered on time. I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department will be pushing the local authorities to ensure this happens.  Senator Colm Burke also raised the matter of the cost of insurance for professionals in the medical sector, a matter he has sought to raise with the Minister for Health on several occasions. I will renew my representations to the Minister on the matter.  Senator Rónán Mullen spoke about the State Claims Agency and the admission of liability. The Minister for Health has commented on this issue and I am sure he is aware of the Senator's comments on the admission of liability which have been broadcast on several occasions in the newspapers and elsewhere. In addition to speaking about milk quotas, Senator Michael D'Arcy expressed disappointment at the allocation for the provision of housing in his county. Each local authority was asked to bring forward specific building projects up to 2017. As part of that strategy, targets had to be agreed with each local authority in 2015. I am sure the allocation lies somewhere between what a local authority had sought and what it agreed to. The Dublin local authorities will be set housing targets by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government over and above what they proposed to ensure strong delivery where the need is greatest. The combined total up to 2017 for the Dublin local authorities comes to more than €500 million. Approximately 300 separate building proposals are being assessed by the Department and projects will be announced in a number of phases starting in mid-April. Construction work is under way on social housing projects on approximately 33 sites throughout the country. It will continue apace in the next two to three years.  Senator Tom Sheahan mentioned that €62 million had been allocated in housing grants in County Kerry. He also welcomed the funding being put in place for the recruitment of eight new guides at Muckross House, something he had been seeking for quite some time. I am sure it will be welcomed by the people of County Kerry.  Senator Darragh O'Brien welcomed the announcement by EirGrid. The matter was raised on the Order of Business yesterday. It was also raised as a Commencement matter in the House this morning by Senator Denis Landy. Senator Darragh O'Brien might look at what the Minister had to say during that debate.

“Employer obligation to display notice of Employment Rights in the workplace
26. Every employer shall display in a prominent position in or at the place of work, being a place to which employees have regular access and in such a position that it may be read easily by employees, a notice or notices in a form, manner, and in an appropriate language or more than one language that is reasonably likely to be understood by the employees concerned containing the following information—(a) entitlements under employment legislation, either generally or by reference to particular enactments or a particular class or particular classes of enactments or to employees of one or more than one particular class or description, as may be specified in the notice concerned,(b) complaints procedures concerning entitlements under employment legislation, and(c) the contact details of the Workplace Relations Service for the purposes of—(i) making general enquiries regarding entitlements under, and the application and enforcement of, employment legislation, and(ii) communicating information to the Director pursuant to the Protected Disclosure Act.”.I am not going to speak too long on this amendment as we had a lengthy discussion on it on Committee Stage. We disagreed strongly on what the amendment was seeking to do and on our view of what would be reasonable in terms of a notice that employers would be obliged to provide for employees in the workplace in respect of employment rights. The amendment provides that each employer shall display in a prominent position in a place of work a notice or notices in a form, manner and in an appropriate language or more than one language that is reasonably likely to be understood by the employees concerned. This notice would contain information either generally or by reference to particular enactments or a particular class or particular classes of enactments or to employees of one or more than one particular class or description. It would also contain information about complaints procedures concerning entitlements under employment legislation and the contact details of the workplace relations service. This would refer to the various Acts under which employees are protected, the contact details for the workplace commission service and the procedure for making a complaint. It would make people aware of the various Acts under which their rights are covered and what they need to do in terms of accessing the workplace relations commission. Not every worker is in a union, as the Minister knows. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recommended the provision of an obligation to display a notice of basic employment and equality rights information. If the Minister is not minded to accept this amendment, would it be possible for the workplace relations commission to examine what is possible and feasible? This could be one of its jobs of work. It could examine ensuring that employers provide basic information to employees. I imagine the Minister wants the commission to work properly. This is about streamlining the system and making it more efficient in terms of employment rights for both employers and employees. I imagine the Minister wants people to use the service and to be aware of it in order to avail of it. In very simple terms, if we make this service available to people, it is only to the good of the Government which is proposing this commission.  Notwithstanding any concerns the Minister might have about the amendment, will he reflect on the broader point and update the House on what he considers reasonable in terms of the responsibility an employer would have to provide information to employees in respect of this new commission? This is the purpose of the amendment. A new entity is being set up. There should, therefore, be an obligation on employers to ensure that employees have access to it, know about it and that the contact numbers are in their places of work if they need to avail of the service.

The last time we discussed this in the House, the Minister was somewhat concerned about the amount of information that would need to be on the notice and how those notices would find their way through the entire workforce. In my previous life as a trade unionist, I found that lack of information frequently led to more workplace disputes and the escalation of workplace disputes throughout the country. The Minister referred to the amount of detail that would need to be on any such information posters the last time we were here. It could be very simple. It could be as simple as a telephone number and a website address. It should be mandatory in every workplace.I do not foresee a major issue with this. When someone commences employment, he or she should be handed a copy of the poster in miniature form in order that unnecessary workplace disputes will not arise in the future. A provision in this regard would be a welcome addition to the Bill. Bringing together the various strands is a great idea and what I am suggesting would represent the icing on the cake for workers. I ask the Minister to consider accepting the amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	122	I thank Senators for the constructive spirit in which they have presented this amendment. Section 11(1)(a) states one of the core functions of the workplace relations commission will be to "promote the improvement of workplace relations, and maintenance of good workplace relations", while section 11(1)(h) states that the commission shall "provide information to members of the public in relation to employment enactments". Essentially, the job of the commission will be to maintain good relations and to provide information to which people will have access. The difficulty I have with Senator David Cullinane's amendment is that the legal obligations of an employer emanate from the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, which sets out what an employer is obliged to provide to each employee in a written statement of terms and conditions and so on. As stated, when one enters the realm of putting in place an obligation to provide information on 30 items of legislation, one goes beyond what is reasonable both in terms of being absolutely bang up to date with the development of terms and conditions and also the obligation to provide such information. The Senators make the point that the commission should examine how it will ensure that information will be accessible in the workplace. While I cannot commit the commission to a course of action in advance, it is clear from its terms of reference, particularly those set down at sections 11(1)(a) and (h), that this is the sort of area in respect of which it could become involved. I have no difficulty with the principle outlined by both Senators. What we are trying to do is make compliance the norm among employers and ensure that workers will be knowledgeable about what they have a right to expect, etc. That is the culture of what will be involved. However, taking the next step and imposing very explicit legal obligations regarding the provision of information in respect of the myriad legislation to which I refer - I must admit that I have difficulty recalling all of the Acts involved - would be to go beyond the bounds of what constitutes reasonable expectation. I will convey the Senators' views to the new commission in the spirit in which they were offered.

I will not delay proceedings because there are many other amendments with which we must deal. The amendments in this group make provision for the necessary monitoring and compliance mechanisms in anticipation of the industrial relations (amendment) Bill, which is yet to be introduced and which will provide the legal framework for the reinstitution of registered employment agreements, REAs, and registered employment orders, REOs. The amendments contain provisions that would allow access to workplaces for designated union officials and the right for employees to be represented by trade unions. The amendments also seek to ensure compliance. The Minister referred to compliance in his final contribution in respect of amendment No. 27. One of the things I would like to emerge as a result of the enactment of the legislation and the establishment of the new workplace relations commission is a much higher level of compliance. The vast majority of employers in this State are decent and good and they treat their workers well.

Those individuals or companies do a disservice to their counterparts who are decent and good. Compliance is extremely important. One can have all the legislation in the world but if it is not enforced and if there is not compliance with it, difficulties will arise. The penalties and sanctions for those who deliberately breach employment law must be robust. I had a discussion in respect of the subject matter of this Bill with an individual who worked as a trade union official for 40 years. He informed me that on numerous occasions he had cause to bring certain unscrupulous employers before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the rights commissioners and so on in respect of instances where they deliberately refused to pay their employees that to which they were entitled. He indicated that when these employers were brought before the employment rights bodies, they were informed that they had to pay because the money involved was owed to the relevant workers. No penalties were imposed on them, despite the fact that they deliberately held back payment of peoples' wages. If one walks into a shop and removes groceries or other goods without paying, one cannot merely hand them back and apologise. Sanctions and penalties will be imposed. Compliance and enforcement are extremely important. Part of the logic behind amendment No. 29 is to try to strengthen the position in the context of REAs and REOs. Decent employers have nothing to fear in the context of compliance or enforcement. I have no doubt that the vast majority of employers will work with the workplace relations commission in a very constructive manner. That can only be for the common good. The amendments in this group are consistent with those we tabled on Committee Stage. We were hoping the Minister might give further consideration to the matters to which they relate and we look forward to his response.

As a trade unionist, I was struck by one of the comments made at yesterday's launch of the commemorative programme for 2016 in respect of the trade union movement and the part it played in the establishment of this republic. In that context, the Bill is lacking to a certain degree in that it does not contain any recognition of the special place trade unions should occupy. We are moving towards the American ideal whereby workplace committees are replacing registered trade unions, which is regrettable. The trade union movement has played a great role in the development of this country and has assisted many companies in their efforts. I am of the view that the type of responsible trade unions we have here can help the country work a great deal better. Companies frequently come here, establish operations and set up workplace committees and then erode employees' terms and conditions over a period. I support the amendments, particularly Nos. 30 and 31.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	132	The purpose of the legislation is to promote higher levels of compliance. We encountered a number of difficulties in this regard, including the long delays that obtain, the level of complexity in the system and the fact that the same issue could be pursued via different channels. As a result, neither worker nor employer knew where their obligations lay. This did not assist in the context of compliance. There were also problems in the areas of enforcement and recovery. I have sought to bring forward a balanced set of amendments to improve the process and make it more effective to operate. I have also sought to improve the position with regard to recovery whereby if people fail to honour their obligations, it will be easier for workers to pursue them and recover any moneys due. That is the overall purpose of the Bill. A higher level of compliance is the goal. In any modern workplace, the human resource is the key resource of any company. Where employers to do not respect their employees and treat them with dignity, they fail themselves and they treat those to whom I refer in a bad way. We are trying to promote the highest standard of workplace relations. The latter is crucial to our long-term ambition to grow the economy, bring about full employment and so on. Senator Gerard P. Craughwell referred to the central role trade unions had played for many years.We need to recognise that our approach has always been voluntarist and that has been at its core. The success of bodies such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court has been in the way in which they have been able to manage difficult situations. Often even the most intractable dispute has through that process reached a conclusion. It has served us well and we seek to remain within that voluntarist tradition. The sections of the Bill we are dealing with relate to the appointment of inspectors and their powers. Senator David Cullinane himself recognises that his amendment is going a little beyond these sections in that he seeks to anticipate legislation that we will introduce in due course. That legislation is in preparation and we will, I hope, bring it to the House soon. The debate on that legislation should be for that day.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	133	I thank the Minister for his response and look forward to that Bill being brought before the House. We may table those amendments to it if it does not deal with the issues. A voluntarist model of collective bargaining or trade union recognition is always very attractive but the difficulty is that some companies do not accept, or recognise and will not work or engage with trade unions. One such employer, as we know, will find itself in difficulty tomorrow when there will be industrial action involving low-paid workers at Dunnes Stores. It is much better for workers who are members of a trade union, who pay union dues, to have a right to be represented by that trade union because they are paying into a service where somebody with expertise, skills and an understanding of how the employment rights system works is there to represent them. The employers who will not recognise trade unions have an array of resources, barristers and qualified people to advise them. The worker on the shop floor in a low-paid job, which can be very difficult, should be entitled to be represented by a trade union. No decent employer will have a difficulty with this. Only those who want to treat their workers unfairly have a difficulty recognising trade unions. I know there is collective bargaining legislation in the offing too. I hope the Minister will bring it forward before the Government dissolves at some point in the next 12 months. I hope it does not slip through the cracks. The reference to allowing trade union officials access to represent the workers is one that I will push because it is vitally important. I fully support the streamlining and the new effective way of dealing with employment rights because it is good for employers and employees. Employers should have a legal responsibility to recognise trade unions and allow their workers access to their trade union officials. I feel strongly about that despite what some might see as the attractiveness of the voluntarist model.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	134	Collective bargaining legislation is in preparation and will be passed before the expiry of the Government. It is at a very advanced stage. It will deal with cases where employers who refuse to recognise trade unions and fail to offer reasonable terms and conditions comparable with other areas, and will make it possible for trade unions to go to the Labour Court to get an adjudication that could become legally binding upon the employer. This will provide a way in which trade unions representing workers can pursue a case of that nature and get a binding determination. That legislation will come before the House and we can debate it then. I cannot accept the amendment.

It would be remiss of me, however, not to support what Senator David Cullinane has said about the Dunnes Stores industrial relations, which is appalling and is the opposite of what this Bill is trying to achieve. It is archaic and backward. I am shocked that a company of that size would treat its employees in this awful way with short-term or low-pay contracts.

This is to give some protection to businesses to ensure they have a record of what documents have been taken. Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are particularly vulnerable if certain documents are taken. If a business has a record of what documents are taken that will help in future legal proceedings. This amendment is to bring in some safeguards for businesses particularly SMEs. If an inspector is able to take documents away he has to be able to leave a record of what he has taken away with that business. It seems quite logical and I got the impression that it was likely to be accepted when we discussed this on Committee Stage.
#GerardPCraughwell	unknown-#GerardPCraughwell-party	unknown-#GerardPCraughwell-dob	unknown-#GerardPCraughwell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	143	I second the amendment. Senator Feargal Quinn is speaking from the employer’s side and I speak from the trade union side, but I agree totally with what he has said. I have seen case after case become complex because documentation was missing or lost. I have seen one side accuse the other, saying it did or did not produce the documents and at the end of cases documents were not available. It is a very reasonable amendment. It will not substantially change the Bill but it will provide some degree of security for employers who may be reluctant to hand over full documentation at the start of a case. I listened to what the Minister said on the last Stage, but I am still on Senator Feargal Quinn’s side on this issue. Both ends of the spectrum support this amendment, all that is needed is for the Minister, who is in the middle, to accept it. Senator Sean D. Barrett who is also in the middle supports it too. I do not think it will do any harm to include this amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	144	I indicated on Committee Stage that I would consider this amendment further and respond to the Senator on Report Stage. I have done that and I am informed that it is the standard practice of NERA to issue a receipt in circumstances where it is necessary to remove original documents either for copying or for use in the course of the inspection or court proceedings. It is also NERA’s standard practice to return the originals as soon as it has finished with these records.If for some reason NERA wishes to retain the original records it will give copies to the business on request. It does not issue receipts for copies of records given to it by an employer where it retains the originals. I am informed that there has never been any issue raised by employers regarding the manner in which NERA deals with this matter.  As I said on Committee Stage, the power given to an inspector by section 27(1)(c) to remove any such books and detain them for such period as he or she reasonably considers to be necessary for the purposes of his or her functions under the Act is an appropriate, necessary and proportionate power. I envisage that it will ordinarily be used only in cases of suspected fraud. There is nothing in section 27 which prohibits an employer from whom records are being temporarily removed from requesting an inspector to allow him or her to take copies of such records before they are removed by the inspector. It is intended that the practices in this regard, which have been successfully operated by NERA since its establishment, will also be adopted by its successor to the WRC compliance service following the enactment of the Bill. Therefore, I am satisfied that it is not necessary to put these procedures on a statutory footing.

I am always worried when I hear that something is "standard practice". That is because it is standard practice until it does not happen. Then, when a trade union or an employer seeks to get the information, they have no legal right to it. I am disappointed to hear the Minister say that as it is standard practice there is no need to put it into legislation. It seems to be a very sensible, moderate, mild and very short answer to what is likely to become a much bigger problem if we do not do something about it. I am concerned that the Minister is satisfied by the fact that it is standard practice, rather than wants to make it enforceable.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	146	This amendment is of a technical nature to ensure consistency of terminology in the subsection. Section 27(4) provides a statutory basis to allow a judge of the District Court, in specified circumstances, to issue a warrant to an inspector appointed under this legislation. The warrant will permit a named inspector, accompanied by such other inspectors or members of An Garda Síochána as may be necessary at any time or times within one month from the date of issue of the warrant, to enter a specified private dwelling for the purpose of ensuring compliance with employment legislation. This amendment clarifies that a warrant under this section can be issued only in respect of a private dwelling. Such a warrant is not required by an inspector to enter any other type of premises or place.

"Liability of a company officer or officers for a breach of employment law
29. Where a breach of employment law is committed by a body corporate or by a company officer or officers acting on behalf of a body corporate and is determined to have been so committed, with the consent, connivance or approval of, or to have been attributable to any neglect on the part of, a person or persons who, when the breach was committed was a company officer or officers of the body corporate, then that person or persons shall be personally liable for the breach committed.".We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage. It is concerned with piercing the corporate veil and is a matter on which ICTU has lobbied all of us. It will enable the pursuit of directors of a company ensuring employees can seek recovery of payments and access to entitlements. We have heard of a number of situations like this in recent times. Connolly's Shoes is one example where a lack of legislation in this area was a problem. We are trying to plug a hole by proposing this amendment and I hope the Minister is in a position to accept it.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	150	Amendment No. 37 is not appropriate as section 7(2) of the Bill already provides for the criminal liability of certain persons connected to a body corporate in certain circumstances in the case of offences under the legislation. To extend liability for the debts of an insolvent company to the officers of the company would, I am advised by the Attorney General, be constitutionally suspect and would represent a major departure in company law. The overriding principle of company law is that a director's duties are owed to the company and not to individual shareholders or employees. If there is a breach of duty on their part which causes damage to the company they can be sued and held liable for damages. Claims can be brought by shareholders, a financial institution or on a director versus director basis. Liability may arise out of the lack of care and skill in the performance of the duties, such as negligent advice or misstatement. Any act which goes beyond the limits of the company's constitution, such as excessive borrowing, unauthorised payments, a failure to disclose the full extent of the director's interests or a failure to comply with requirements, may involve a director or officer in a personal liability.  Company law penalties vary from restrictions to disqualification orders to fines or periods of imprisonment. The new companies Acts provide for a four-tier categorisation for most of the offences with the exception of fraudulent trading or market abuse. The Companies Acts also contain a new provision whereby a judge, following a conviction for an offence under the companies Acts, may order that they remedy any breach of the Companies Acts in respect of which they were convicted. In effect, the provision in the Companies Acts is a more constitutionally robust rewording of section 383 of the 1963 Act, as amended by section 100 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. From a company law perspective, the proposed amendment challenges the entire principle of company law. If it were to be implemented then the doctrine of separate legal personality would become an exception rather than the rule. Having regard to the foregoing, I am not prepared to accept this amendment.

Clearly, in respect of any such premises which is a private dwelling the inspector will first have to have obtained a warrant pursuant to section to section 27(3).

Why is that? This is Report Stage and it is not good practice that Oireachtas Members are given such short notice about amendments of this nature. I wonder why there are so many. This seems to be the case with many Bills brought forward by the Department. The matter was raised in a meeting of the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the committee has agreed to write to the Minister on the subject. Can the Minister tell us why there are so many Government amendments? He must accept that it does not represent good practice. It might be understandable on Committee Stage but not on Report Stage.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	154	The reason is that the changes we are making such as in the areas of adjudication and enforcement have a knock-on impact on dozens of pieces of legislation elsewhere. One has to ensure the original legislation is correctly amended to reflect the new process. That involves going back over swathes of legislation to ensure everything is correct. In all cases the amendments are technical and tidy up legislation but the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel tries to ensure the legislation carries no risk of ambiguity. Scrubbing the text goes on throughout the process. I accept that it is a bit frustrating, but all I can do is assure the Senator that they are not substantive amendments. If the amendments made any change of which the Seanad needed to be aware we would alert Members accordingly. The Senator will be able to imagine the geometry of the legislation where 30 pieces of legislation have 40 sections each. We then change parent legislation and that causes a domino effect; therefore, the Senator will imagine the multiplication of work involved.While I understand fully what the Senator is saying, from my point of view it is better to get all these technical things done right and done now than to come back and be obliged to start the process again.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	157	On amendment No. 41, section 32, as drafted, is strictly limited in its application to information relating to the alleged commission of an offence under a relevant enactment or the contravention of a relevant enactment. For this reason, the Senator's proposed amendment is inappropriate, as it is inconsistent with the section taken as a whole. Essentially, the issue here is that agencies share information where there are suspected criminal offences. However, there also is a balance to be struck in respect of confidentiality and privacy of people's dealings with individual agencies. Consequently, if no suspected offence is being pursued, there is no automatic right or expectation of sharing. This provision seeks to strike a balance in order that anyone pursuing an offence absolutely has a right to get access to this information but other than that, people have a right to expect a degree of confidentiality and privacy in their dealings. That is the balance being struck.

As I will not be pushing it to a vote, it is okay.  This amendment pertains to enforcement of the national minimum wage. The question of whether it is increased or decreased will now be an issue for the low pay commission, which is a different story. However, this amendment seeks to increase the minimum fine from €2,000 to €4,000 for non-compliance. Sinn Féin believes this amendment will deal with vexatious employers who will seek to delay compliance and this reverts to the issue of compliance about which I spoke earlier. In Britain, new legislation has been introduced that provides for fines of up to £20,000 for non-compliance or non-payment of the national minimum wage. Sinn Féin does not advocate a penalty of that size and believes it is being reasonable in this regard. Moreover, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions also has asked for consideration to be given to increasing the fine from €2,000 to €4,000 to act as a sufficient deterrent to employers who may not pay the minimum wage. If there are increases in the minimum wage, the Senator may have concerns that some companies may not be able to afford to pay them. Again, I imagine the Minister or the low pay commission will deal with this issue. There are mechanisms in place for employers who genuinely cannot pay any increase in the national minimum wage not to so do. As there is an inability-to-pay element to all of that, I do not believe it should be a real concern. As for those who can pay, if they can do so they will pay and no major issue arises. However, this amendment is about those who can afford to pay but do not, which is a different story. The proposal is to increase the penalty from €2,000 to €4,000.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	164	The Senator may be mistaking what is being provided for. This provision is dealing with fixed payment notices and the penalty for such fixed payment notices. Essentially, they are minor offences and these are fixed charges that are issued without proceedings and they concern only limited offences. One is a requirement on the employer to consult with employees' representatives in respect of collective redundancies, another is to provide an employee with a payslip and a third is to provide a written statement of the hourly rate of pay. Penalties of this nature can be set by way of a fixed charge without a substantive case. It is a limited category and is not the broad category to which the Senator refers. Obviously, were one to opt for higher penalties in this regard, there would be a conflict between the fixed charge without a process, the seriousness of offences and the scale of the penalty. These are minor offences with minor charges, which are appropriate to a fixed notice procedure. I do not propose that the fixed notice procedure would apply in cases like failure to pay the minimum wage, which of course would be a criminal offence. There may be something of a misunderstanding in the Senator's amendment here. These are very limited cases for which I am providing in this regard and I do not believe the doubling of the penalty as suggested would be appropriate.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	167	Amendment No. 43 seeks to provide that a complaint that has been referred to mediation or case resolution could only be dealt with by a mediation officer or by way of teleconference in exceptional circumstances and upon the agreement of the complainant. It is implicit that the consent of both parties is a prerequisite to all forms of mediation and case resolution. The Senator's proposed amendment therefore is superfluous in this regard and inappropriate, in so far as it focuses only on the claimant. Essentially, mediation is a voluntary process and the mediator is a professional person who seeks to use whatever ways he or she can to reach an agreement. At any point, however, both sides can withdraw and consequently, to try to be too prescriptive of the approach would not be helpful to the successful execution of the mediation. Therefore, I do not believe it is appropriate to make this amendment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	172	I think it goes somewhat further than that. This amendment seeks to introduce a new subsection to section 39, which would provide that a case resolution officer could direct either or both parties in the dispute or complaint that is the subject of mediation to produce documentation and evidence to the other party upon which that party intends to rely in respect of their respective cases. As I stated, mediation is a voluntary process from which either party can withdraw at any stage in favour of pursuing the adjudication option. Giving a case resolution officer the power to direct the parties to produce information would undermine the voluntary nature of the mediation process. The Senator's proposal to include a new section 39(9) is inappropriate, as what is proposed confuses the case resolution and adjudication function. The point being made is that in adjudication, it is clear that there should be production of documentation that people can see and so on but where one is mediating between the two sides, using mediation as a form of discovery would not be appropriate. It is not the environment in which mediation is being considered. It is where two sides are seeking to find a resolution without going to the ultimate adjudication. The view is that this provision would not be helpful to a successful implementation of mediation.

The staff and officers who deal with these cases must be properly trained in equality legislation.

All successful applicants have been required to undergo an accredited adjudicator training programme which has been delivered by the National College of Ireland during the past three months. The training programme covered areas such as employment equality and industrial relations law as well as administrative law and human rights law, how to conduct an inquisitorial hearing and how to write comprehensive and reasoned decisions. The training programme has concluded and all the participants have undertaken an examination and assessment. Only those who successfully pass that assessment will be formally appointed as WRC adjudicators and assigned cases. That deals with the concern raised by the Senator. All applicants have been through a rigorous training process.

The additional subsection (10) specifically provides that in respect of such complaints and disputes, the adjudication officer to whom they are assigned will continue to perform the functions that were vested in him as a rights commissioner under the relevant legislation. This is to ensure the legitimate expectations of the parties in question concerned are respected and legal entitlements that applied on the date the complaint was referred. It is a transitional provision.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	178	This amendment is being introduced to bring clarity to the situation as regards to whom complaints can be made under the Employment of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012. The 2012 Act is a unique employment law in that there are three actors involved: the employee who is the agency worker; the employer who is the agency and the hirer which is the entity for which the agency worker carries out the work. The 2012 Act clearly distinguishes those sections of the Act where an employee can take a case against the employer from those sections of the Act where an employee can take the case against the hirer. As the purpose of the Workplace Relations Bill is to streamline structure and processes rather than to make any substantive changes in the employment rights legislation, it is important that section 42 of the Bill which deals with the presentation of complaints clearly reflects this distinction. The amendments being made in section 42 do not change the broad scheme of section 42 as it relates to the temporary agency workers Act. It remains the case that those provisions of the temporary agency workers Act which can be subject of a claim against an employer included in Schedule 5 to the Bill. The amendment being made to subsection(1) clarifies that the provisions listed in that Schedule are those where a complaint can be made that an employee's employer has contravened any of the proposed provisions in Schedule 5. The previous text did not specify against whom a complaint could be made, simply stating that an employee or a specified person could present a case or complaint to the director general that a provision in Schedule 5 had been contravened in relation to the complainant. This ambiguity is now being clarified. Instances where a complaint under the temporary agency workers Act can be made against the hirer are dealt with in Paragraph 3A and there is no change in this regard as no clarification was deemed necessary. This distinction between hirer and employer has to be reflected accurately in the making of a complaint to clarify that in certain cases it is the hirer who is responsible and not the employer.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	182	The Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts will continue to govern the presentation of complaints of discrimination to the WRC and the adjudication officers will have regard to the specific provisions governing such cases in the Equality Acts and not the provisions of section 42. Section 42 does not apply directly to employment equality and equal status cases but rather sections 84 and 85 amend the Equality Acts and Equal Status Acts and make them consistent with the provisions of section 42. There is no merit in requiring a separate hearing of equality cases from the other employment matters which may be in dispute between an employer and an employee. If there was an employment and equality aspect to a case, this could lead to four separate hearings of the same case with the same facts, two at first instance and two at appeal. There is no justification for this and it would add unnecessary cost to the employer, employee and the State. The Senator's proposal runs contrary to what the Bill is trying to achieve by providing a fast and effective independent streamlined adjudication service. Therefore, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	183	This is a technical amendment to section 42(4)(b). It reflects the drafter's proposed reconfiguration of the Schedules. Senators David Norris and Gerard P. Craughwell queried why trade unions had been singled out for mention in section 42(3)(a) of the Bill. This section 42(3)(a) provides for the presentation of complaints by an agency worker or any trade union of which the agency worker is a member, that a hirer within the meaning of the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) 2012 has contravened sections 11, 24 or 14 of the Act. The language used mirrors the wording of Paragraph 11B of Schedule 2 of the temporary agency workers Act which sets out the redress provisions under the 2012 Act. I draw the Senator's attention to the fact that this wording is not in fact unique to the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act. Many pieces of employment rights legislation use the same wording which provides that unions can present a complaint on behalf of an employee. These include the Organisation of Working Time Act, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act. The wording in each piece of employment rights legislation is the product of careful consideration of the nuances around each piece of legislation and consultation with stakeholders. Section 42(3)(a) simply reflects the wording of Paragraph 11B of the said Act. This is how it should be and the Workplace Relations Bill is not the appropriate place to make substantive changes. There was a concern that there were different treatments in different Acts but that is the nature of the originating Act which makes different provisions which we do not wish to disturb.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22662	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	187	As I indicated on Committee Stage, I have afforded further consideration to this issue with a view to addressing the matter by way of amendment, if necessary. I have carefully considered this issue and thoroughly explored the matter with officials in my Department.I am not satisfied that an amendment to this effect is warranted for a number of reasons. The system that will apply following the establishment of the workplace relations commission provides for mediation to be offered if, in the opinion of the director general of the workplace relations commission, the complaint or dispute is capable of being resolved without being referred to an adjudication officer. Only cases where mediation is not offered or is unsuccessful will proceed to adjudication. This amendment would allow an adjudication officer to refer a case back to a mediation officer for mediation following referral of the case by the director general for adjudication.  The philosophy underpinning the new workplace relations system is that issues should be resolved as informally as possible as soon as possible. To this end, the system is designed to provide information in order that, where possible, issues can be resolved at the level of the employment without ever being referred to the workplace relations commission. Where this is not possible, a complaint can be made to the commission. Where parties indicate an interest in mediation delivered by the early resolution service or face-to-face mediation, such an intervention will be offered, subject to capacity constraints. Where the issue is not resolved or the parties are not interested in mediation, the case will move to adjudication for a decision. The role of the adjudicator will not be to broker a settlement but to consider the case made by both sides, apply the relevant law and come to a decision. The proposed amendment would fundamentally alter the role of the adjudicator as envisaged in the new system. Mediation is already provided for at an early stage in the new system. To refer the dispute formally back to mediation would add time and cost to the entire process, possibly making the process twice as expensive for the State. One would have the costs of the first adjudication, the costs of mediation where the case is referred back and the costs of a second adjudication if the mediation is not successful. Both parties have the option of engaging in mediation before the adjudication and both have the option of reaching agreement and withdrawing the case before it goes to adjudication. Both parties also have the option of reaching an agreement and withdrawing the case during the adjudication hearing. In practice, an adjudicator would adjourn for a short period to facilitate this option if exercised. Introducing a second chance of mediation would reduce the incentive to reach an agreement at the initial mediation stage and lead to inefficiency in the system, increased costs and knock-on delays for other cases. I assure the Senator that we gave much thought to whether this amendment was a good suggestion. I hope the reflections I have outlined set out a reasonable case for sticking to the approach we have adopted, which I believe to be fair.

In addition to existing provisions in enactments that safeguard workers from penalisation and victimisation, an employer or any person acting on behalf of an employer shall not penalise an employee for seeking to exercise or having exercised any entitlement under employment legislation including availing or cooperating with the Workplace Relations Commission.”.The amendment relates to victimisation and those who are defending employment rights. While the area of anti-victimisation is broad, the issue is frequently and correctly raised by trade unions and should be central to efforts to address or redress issues related to employment rights.Unfortunately, some employees are victimised by their employers, for example, for joining a trade union. It is a much more substantial issue. The Minister might be able to inform the House as to whether anti-victimisation legislation or measures may form part of whatever collective bargaining legislation he intends to bring forward. We see it as a critical area of employment rights.

However, a person is not permitted to proceed to have both complaints heard. As currently framed, section 101 of the Employment Equality Act provides an effective bar against double recovery for dismissal in these circumstances. The proposed amendment to section 84 is a necessary amendment to section 101 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and ensures in the new framework that a complainant cannot recover under both the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Employment Equality Act in respect of the same dismissal. This objective is achieved by providing that a person who referred a dismissal complaint under both Acts must elect between one or the other by a prescribed date or date to be inferred from regulations by the Minister. If the person fails to elect by this date, the discriminatory dismissal complaint will be deemed to have been withdrawn.

The motion welcomes the establishment by the Government last year of the new office of Minister of State for new communities, culture and equality and commends the Minister of State for the work he has done to date with new communities. Of course, the real impetus behind it was the organisation of the inaugural PolskaÉire 2015 festival which, as Members are aware, took place last week and proved to be hugely successful. The motion also calls on the Minister of State to outline to the Seanad the work he has done on matters related to integration and new communities and in the development of the national integration strategy. I very much look forward to hearing what he has to say. I begin by referring to the issue of new communities and integration in general. This subject is close to my heart, particularly as my grandfather moved here from what was then Czechoslovakia in 1946 at a time when there was very little inward migration to Ireland. His name was Karel Bacik and he was involved in the glass industry in Bohemia. When he came to Ireland, he re-established Waterford Glass which was later taken over by an Irish consortium. His influence really brings home the message on the enormously positive contribution new communities can make to Ireland's economy and society. My grandfather brought over quite a number of Czech craftsmen to work in the glass factory in Waterford and some of their descendants, including my cousins, still live there. Mine is very much a personal story about the contribution of new communities, although they were not identified as such in the 1940s, when all we had were very small communities of inward migrants. Happily, much larger numbers of such migrants now live here and they contribute to Ireland's society and economy. That is what was really being celebrated during the PolskaÉire festival last week. The Minister of State has previously recounted his experience of hearing a loud cheer from Croke Park during a soccer friendly between Ireland and Poland in 2008. When he heard the cheer, he assumed Ireland had scored a goal and was shocked when he discovered it had been scored by Poland. The cheer, of course, had come from the Polish supporters in the crowd that evening. This is a great story because it illustrates just how big the Polish community here is and how important it is to Ireland. We all have Polish friends. Polish people are well integrated into all communities and every local shop now stocks Polish goods. The Polish deputy head of mission in Ireland wrote the foreword to the PolskaÉire festival programme and referred to how much Ireland and Poland had in common in both history and culture. It is estimated that some 150,000 Polish citizens live in Ireland and that Polish is now the second most widely spoken language on the island of Ireland. These are remarkable statistics and worth celebrating. The Minister of State deserves enormous commendation for taking the initiative to celebrate the diversity of the Polish community. I take the opportunity to welcome the representatives of the Polish community and the PolskaÉire festival who have joined us in the Visitors Gallery. I am glad to see them here. We are all very happy to welcome them for this debate.We in this House are all very happy to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, for this debate. We were just speaking about the PolskaÉire festival. In a sense, it was an initiative that was overdue because the Polish community in this country has now become so large and so well integrated. A hugely varied range of events was on offer as part of the festival. In a way, the festival was built around the important European championship qualifier between Ireland and Poland, which as everyone is aware was held on Sunday night. We had the very equitable one-all result, which nicely matched the atmosphere of the festival itself. We had events as varied as: a course of learning Polish through football; a Polish-Irish art exhibition in Polish House on Fitzwilliam Place; FAI open days across the country - the FAI was an important partner in the festival; events on integration and Polish-Irish relations in both the Mansion House and in UCD; the very important Oireachtas GAA challenge match last Tuesday night; the Polish film festival which is ongoing in Smithfield; and an event in Cork in the Crawford Gallery on the story of Casimir Markievicz. It was only really when I was looking over the programme of events that I suddenly realised that just outside this Chamber we have a picture with a very strong Polish connection, one which is replicated in the PolskaÉire festival brochure, namely, the painting of Constance Markievicz, the first woman Deputy elected to Dáil Éireann and the first woman elected in December 1918 to the House of Commons in Westminster, although she did not take her seat. The portrait hanging outside the Seanad Chamber is reputedly painted by her husband, Casimir Markievicz, who was the Polish connection. As everyone is aware, she was born Constance Gore-Booth. I thought it was a very nice way to illustrate the long relations between the two countries to have an event centred around the life of Casimir Markievicz. When I organised an event in the Dáil Chamber in December 2008 to mark the 90th anniversary of the election of Constance Markievicz, we had a speech read out in the Chamber that she had given to the Irish Women's Franchise League during the campaign to get votes for women. She spoke of the need for women to wear short skirts, stout boots and to carry a revolver when they were campaigning for votes. Perhaps that was somewhat over militant but it illustrated the mood of the time. In the brief time available I first commend the Minister of State for organising the PolskaÉire festival and for taking this great initiative in conjunction with the Polish community in Ireland with the FAI and other stakeholders including city councils. I congratulate him on the success of the festival. I also wish to talk more generally about integration and new communities. We know from census 2011 that there are 540,000 people who are not Irish citizens resident in Ireland, which is approximately 12% to 15% of the population. In fact, nearly three quarters of the non-Irish population are from the United Kingdom or the European Union and from within the Union the biggest number are Polish citizens. Since 2011 more than 59,000 people have been granted Irish citizenship. A very important achievement of the Government is that when it came into office in 2011 there was a backlog of more than 22,000 citizenship applications unprocessed on a ministerial desk. The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, described in this House the stasis that had taken hold where nobody was processing routine applications. It was his initiative to start the citizenship ceremonies which have been so successful all over the country. The processing time for citizenship applications has reduced from 31 months to fewer than six months and the citizenship ceremonies themselves are hugely important in making people feel a sense of pride, ownership and that they have a stake in the country to which they have chosen to pledge their allegiance. It is a great improvement on the previous system. I have many friends who had made citizenship applications which were granted in a District Court at the end of a long list with absolutely no ceremony or sense that one was being welcomed into the community. The ceremony has been a very important initiative in itself that has fostered greater integration. Many other important initiatives have been carried out on integration and immigration law reform in the lifetime of the Government. The British-Irish visa scheme is very important in allowing a single visa for both Britain and Ireland for people from abroad. The civilianisation of the immigration service has freed up members of the Garda for other duties. Another very important measure is the legislative reform of the asylum system. The protection Bill is to be introduced shortly by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. She has already had Cabinet approval in principle for that. We are due to have pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence shortly after Easter. I look forward to that because it is very important that we would reform the asylum system. I am aware it is a subject close to the Minister of State's heart, as is direct provision, which we have spoken about in this House many times. I again welcome the establishment last October of the protection process working group which is due to report soon, and which we very much hope will make recommendations for reform of the direct provision system. It must be noted that the number of people in direct provision has fallen. There has been a particular effort to move families out of direct provision, which is important and welcome. Other issues that have had to be handled in a crisis response followed from the closure of private language schools. Many international students were left high and dry by the sudden closure of those schools. Concerted efforts have been made to ensure that those students are looked after and that they are not simply left in the lurch when the schools closed. Another issue on which the Minister of State and I have worked, and on which the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence has done a great deal of work in terms of integration, is that of recognition of Traveller ethnicity. Members are aware that the committee recommended that the Government would recognise Traveller ethnicity. We learned from our hearings with experts that this would not require statutory change and that a declaration by the Minister for Justice and Equality on behalf of the Government would suffice. We have made the recommendation and the Minister of State will continue to work towards achieving that aim because it is an important integration matter, albeit that it does not relate to new communities. I am aware the Minister of State will address the national integration strategy. I very much welcome the fact that the review was announced last year before the Minister of State's office came into being and that there would be a review of Ireland's approach to the integration of migrants. A cross-departmental group was established in that regard. More than 80 submissions have been made from a wide range of NGOs, groups and individuals on the development of the national integration strategy. Consultation sessions have taken place and a draft strategy is being prepared. I look forward very much to hearing from the Minister of State about this. I commend the Minister of State for the work he has done. I also commend those involved in the organisation of the PolskaÉire festival. I look forward to many more such festivals in the years to come.

I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, in congratulating him on the work he has done as Minister of State with responsibility for new communities, culture and equality. I take the opportunity to second the Labour Party Private Members' motion. I commend the Minister of State's efforts to eliminate inequality and his commitment to tackling racism in this country. It is an area that has been sadly neglected and he has brought new life and vigour to it. In reality, more and more people choose to spend their life in Ireland. The latest census figures show that one in nine people living in this country was born abroad. Ireland is becoming a more diverse and multicultural society. Therefore, it is essential to have someone in government responsible for representing and integrating new communities. Integration means access to and participation in all aspects of Irish life - economic, social, cultural and political. Like Senator Ivanas Bacik, I wish to congratulate the Minister of State, in particular, on the PolskaÉire 2015 festival, which was an enormous success. A testament to this is that one of our colleagues, Senator John Gilroy, suffered what was, thankfully, a non-fatal injury defending the Oireachtas football team to a draw against our Polish counterparts.

It was well worth it to celebrate the diversity that Polish people bring to the country. The sporting element of the event is very important also. We were down a man in the Seanad but that is the way it goes. A recent study from NUI Galway showed that the most effective way to get Muslim youth integrated into society was through participation in sport.Therefore, I think sports, particularly local GAA and soccer clubs, have an important part to play. Basing the PolskaÉire festival around the Ireland-Poland match recognised the powerful effect that sports can have in creating communities.  I wish to refer briefly to the issue of direct provision which I have raised a number of times in this House. Before the Minister of State was appointed to his current portfolio, he was very vocal on the need for reform of the direct provision system. I brought this matter to his attention here just after he had been appointed and I applaud his commitment to that reform since assuming his ministerial role. He and his colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality have launched the working group on direct provision. In addition, last week they published the heads of the international protection Bill. This will be the biggest change to refugee law in this country in 20 years.  I want to see these new application procedures speed up decisions on asylum applications, as well as reducing the time during which applicants are left in limbo. It is so difficult to build a new life in any country, but it is reprehensible to expect people to do so without the basic freedoms that most of us enjoy, such as the right to work and to choose where we live. The sooner these applicants can have a fair decision and truly integrate into Irish society, the better.  I also want to talk about the economic benefits that immigrants bring to this country. There is much discussion in the media about the debate in the United Kingdom on a referendum to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. A large part of that debate is focused on anti-immigrant sentiment which is widespread and growing across Europe. We must not let ourselves succumb to misinformation, however. The UK general election is looming and the likes of UKIP and the Conservative Party are running on a strong anti-immigration platform and are seriously considering a UK exit from the European Union. In the struggle for economic recovery from the global financial crisis, immigrants are being demonised and used as scapegoats for large-scale unemployment in certain sectors of society. New evidence, however, shows that European immigrants are having a positive impact in the United Kingdom, despite popular opinion. For example, data from the UCL centre for research and analysis of migration show that European immigrants in the United Kingdom have paid more in taxes than they have received in benefits and have helped to relieve the fiscal burden on UK-born workers, as well as contributing to financing public services. European immigrants who have arrived in the United Kingdom since 2000 have contributed more than £20 billion to UK public finances between 2001 and 2011. Additionally, they provide productive human capital that would otherwise have cost the United Kingdom £6.8 billion in spending on education. It is not a far stretch to apply the same results to Ireland. The 2011 census figures show that one in three newcomers to this country has a degree or other higher education qualification. Immigrants in this country comprise well educated and hard-working people who have chosen to be part of Irish society. They are contributing to the economic recovery of this country, as well as to the cultural and social richness of modern Irish life.  It is important to have a Government position dedicated to addressing the needs of new communities. More important, however, is to get representatives from these new communities into politics and public representation. Many non-Irish citizens do not realise that they have a right to vote. Due to a lack of information they are shut out of participating in Irish political life. Opportunities are thus lost to hear the views of these communities directly and to have policies that reflect these views. We need to work hard to change this.  I welcome the comments last week by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, at a USI conference in Athlone. She addressed the issue of college fees for asylum applicants. Due to the cost of third-level education, these young people are not progressing and are shut out of education. Last year, the Minister of State and I attended the Tom Johnson Summer School. We spoke to a young mother whose daughter gave a poignant example of how she was shut out of the Irish education system by having no opportunity to progress post-leaving certificate into university.

Such students work hard to complete their leaving certificate examinations, yet they face the same third level fees that wealthy overseas students would be charged for medical courses. If we are to have a fair and equal society we need to change this system as a matter of urgency. I echo Senator Ivana Bacik's comment that ethnic status should be awarded to the Traveller community. It may be the subject of another debate but we cannot let is slip off the agenda. It is urgent and needs to be addressed.

These self-congratulatory motions are not exclusive to the current Government side. When we were in government, we used to get them as well and they always made me cringe, as this one does a little bit. I was taken by Senator Ivana Bacik's nice story about the genesis of Waterford Glass. As someone who lives close to Waterford in the south-east, I know how important that enterprise was. I was aware of the story, but I did not realise the Senator was actually related to the gentleman involved.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	246	The Senator is going up in my opinion. As a contrarian in this House, can I say my party will not be opposing the motion before us? I welcome the appointment of a Minister of State for the new communities because integration is hugely important. The various immigrants to Ireland in the past 20 years, in particular, have added significantly to, and have enhanced the fabric of, Irish society. Their presence is now making a distinctive contribution to our development. That experience in the past 20 years has been good for Ireland, but there has been a lack of Government action on direct provision and undocumented migrants. In addition, there has been a failure to publish a new national integration strategy.  I will single out two immigrant communities. Our largest immigrant population are the British, which is interesting. I know anecdotally from speaking with such people in all corners of Ireland that many of them left Britain because they no longer felt at home in what was regarded as their own country. That is a cautionary note for us to ensure the qualities which have held us in good stead are of value and need to be preserved in integrating our immigrant community.  The second largest community is the Polish one. Like Senator Ivana Bacik, I also pay tribute to their contribution. We have many Polish people in New Ross. There are two industries, a transport company and an American medical company, which employ significant numbers of Polish people. It is obvious that they have a tremendously good work ethic. They are here to secure a better life but also to make a contribution. One of the things we have as a nation is a tremendously good work ethic, which applies here as much as to Irish emigrants going abroad. It has stood us in good stead and also provides opportunities for those who emigrate.  In recent years local industries in New Ross have become involved in a seven-a-side competition. For the first time last year we had a seven-a-side team entered by the Polish community which received a lot of support. In fact, it created a good atmosphere surrounding the entire competition.  Most of the Polish here are devout Catholics who play a full part at parish level. That is also a great mechanism for integration. Many Polish people attend mass on Sundays and are thus part of the parish community.In the context of that particular tradition and the good Christian values of the Polish people, somewhat fortuitously, I happened to be on a trip to Poland with the then Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights when the funeral of St. John Paul II was taking place. I was in Warsaw for the funeral mass and subsequently travelled to Krakow that evening. The devotion of young Polish people to St. John Paul II at the time and the way in which his death had affected them was extremely touching. One could not but be impressed by what one had witnessed. I was struck by the fact that St. John Paul II was not just regarded as a religious leader but he was also a great national hero to the Polish people. I would like the Minister of State to comment on the review of integration policy. It appears that the Government has been dragging its feet on it. The review was announced in March 2014 by the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter. The programme for Government included a commitment to promote policies which contributed to integration, but just over one year after the announcement of the review, there is no sign any such policy. There was great fanfare about the cross-departmental group on integration being reconstituted and given a mandate to review activities in this area. Failure to integrate will leave a large number of legacy issues for future generations. In that context, the level of extreme hostility towards Britain and France among some people born there to parents from other countries is a source of grave concern. Britain, France and similar nations are reaping the whirlwind of what a Member of this House referred to as multiculturalism. I am not a fan of multiculturalism. Some years ago I prepared a paper on policing in a multicultural society for one of the third level colleges. I argued in it that we should be talking not about multiculturalism but about interculturalism. Britain and France made mistakes in allowing huge swathes of urban areas to become dominated by particular ethnic groups, with no integration. That was a failure of policy. We should ensure we do not allow a similar situation to develop here. The House has on many occasions discussed the delays and the legal mechanisms used to facilitate them, as well as the costs of the direct provision system. Above all, however, our debates on the issue have focused on the risk to those young people who are losing out on their childhood as a result of being in direct provision facilities. There have been cases in which people have been obliged to wait in the direct provision system for up to nine years. The position in this regard is unacceptable and action must be taken to solve the problem. On quite a few occasions I have been struck by how immigrants from countries from which there is no direct access to Ireland end up here. I am wondering if other countries within the European Union are abrogating their responsibilities. We must play our part proportionately, but we should not allow a system to develop whereby other countries do not play theirs and Ireland is left to pick up the pieces as a result.

I also welcome those in the Visitors Gallery who were responsible for organising the PolskaÉire 2015 festival, including my cousin, Ms Niamh Nestor. I know that she is very passionate about all things Polish and I am aware that she was involved in organising an event at the UCD humanities institute which I was unable to attend but which was extremely successful. I congratulate her on her achievement in that regard. I welcome the motion, particularly as it highlights an important issue and makes a number of worthwhile points. Ireland has witnessed a great many changes during the past 20 years. Immigration has seen the make-up of some towns, villages and cities change completely. Change is never something to be feared and, in that spirit, I am glad to welcome the establishment by the Government of the new office of Minister with responsibility for new communities, culture and equality. All three aspects highlighted within the office of the Minister of State relate to an important issue, namely, new communities, of which there are many and which are drawn from all corners of the world. The members of these communities have come to Ireland for many reasons. If one walks down any street in Dublin's city centre area, one will see food on sale which caters for different ethnicities and the fabric of the city is all the more diverse and better for it. If one walks through the city centre when an international soccer tournament is taking place elsewhere, regardless of which team is playing, be it Costa Rica, Japan, Democratic Republic of Congo, etc., one will find people from that part of the world watching, cheering and often wearing replica jerseys. Much like our emigrants, they want to keep in touch with their home countries, while also embracing the culture of their current home. I hope we can help them to do this and know that, in the context of his new responsibilities, the Minister of State will provide assistance in that regard. Ireland, as a nation, and each of us, as individuals, can now see emigration from both sides, from the perspective of a country welcoming immigrants, including the challenges and opportunities to which it gives rise, as well as from the perspective of a country which has, sadly, lost some of its young people to emigration. We are all aware of the challenges posed by such a country and live in the ever-present hope that if our young people want to return, they will be able to do so some day. In that spirit, the highlighting of equality within the context of the Minister of State's new office is vital. It is important to emphasise that it must to apply to all individuals who reside in Ireland. There are still regrettable instances where people who live here are not treated equally or are slow to achieve equal status. I refer in this regard to the process of direct provision, a matter to which Senators Aideen Hayden and Ivana Bacik have alluded, and the sheer length of time it takes people to work their way through the system. There is no question that equality delayed is equality denied. In that context, I am hopeful an office with a focus on equality can sustain a push to improve the process of direct provision. I know that the Minister of State is personally very passionate about this issue. The motion calls on us to commend the Minister of State for the work he has done to date with new communities. This is certainly something with which I agree because he has truly put these issues at the forefront and continued to battle on them, both by means of introducing legislation and in the media. He has engaged all stakeholders in a way that has shown his sincerity in the matter and I genuinely believe he deserves credit. As Senator Ivana Bacik noted, he was responsible for organising a football match between Oireachtas Members and members of the Polish community. I do not know whether we should be happy or sad about that, particularly when one considers the quality of some of the football played. He was also involved with the PolskaÉire 2015 festival which continued to cement the bond between Poland and Ireland. Immigration to this country from Polan really began during the Celtic tiger era and many of those who came here at the time have remained and made Ireland their home. It is important that we highlight and celebrate this fact and that we continue to bring the two nations together. Irish people made such an impression on Poland during the Euro 2012 soccer tournament that the respective football associations organised two friendly matches – home and away – in the following year. Tourist numbers from Ireland to Poland and vice versa have increased dramatically and I hope they will continue on their upward trajectory. The PolskaÉire 2015 festival was one way to ensure this would be the case. I commend the concept of holding such a festival and hope we can make the 2016 version even better again. My final point relates to the fact that the motion calls on the Minister of State to outline to the Seanad the work he has done in the development of the national integration strategy and on other matters related to integration and new communities. What is still a relatively new office has already achieved a great deal. I wish the Minister of State every success in the year ahead and hope we will see fit to maintain the new office in the future.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	248	I have a formal statement on the implementation of the national integration strategy which I propose to read before commenting on the PolskaÉire 2015 festival. Before I begin, I take the opportunity to thank Shane Long for scoring the equaliser in the last minute of Sunday evening's game. The Government parties are criticised for many things and I suppose the Labour Party could have been criticised for increasing the motivation of the Polish soccer team to do well on home soil, as it were, on Sunday last. I was delighted, in the context of the stability of the Government, that Shane Long managed to score his last minute goal. I welcome the motion and thank the House for giving me the opportunity to provide an update on where we stand in the development of the revised national integration strategy. A Private Members' motion on racism agreed by the Seanad in June 2014 called on the Minister to report back to the House on these matters. This is an opportune time to provide some further information on developments in this area. As Senators will be aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to the promotion of polices which integrate minority ethnic groups in Ireland, including those policies which promote social inclusion, equality, diversity and the participation of immigrants in the economic, social, political and cultural life of their communities. The Government recognises the importance and value of the many new communities that are now an integral part of Irish society. The importance of these groups was recognised and underscored in a tangible manner through the assignment, in July last year, of specific responsibilities for new communities to a Minister of State. The assignment of responsibilities in this manner helps ensure that issues of importance to new communities are highlighted appropriately. I am sure Senators will be aware that we are in the process of reviewing Ireland's strategy on integration. This follows a decision which was taken by the Cabinet committee on social policy early last year. The work on this review is being carried forward by a cross-departmental committee of senior officials and it is chaired by a senior official in my Department. The mandate of the cross-departmental group includes the following specific tasks - to review the activities being undertaken by Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of non-Irish nationals; the preparation of a draft overarching integration strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented; and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders. An important part of the work of the group was to engage in a meaningful way with members of the public. In order to do this, a two-fold approach was undertaken by the committee. The first step was to place a call in media outlets inviting submissions from interested parties who wished to contribute to the work of the group. The closing date for contributions was May 2014 and I am delighted to say more than 80 submissions were received from a wide range of organisations and groups providing services to migrants. The second phase of the consultation process was a series of face-to-face meetings with some of those who contributed material for consideration by the group. Five consultation sessions were held, with each session lasting one day and involving a series of sub-meetings with members of the public. A total of 27 separate groups, one individual and a group of seven individuals met with the cross-departmental group during these sessions. This segment of the consultative process facilitated the highlighting of, and in-depth discussions on, issues of particular concern. They also permitted those contributors present the opportunity of imparting their personal experiences to the committee. I understand those who participated in these meetings, both from the official side and the non-government side, found these face-to-face interactions to be valuable. Separate to the above process, the cross-departmental group also held a series of thematic meetings which addressed particular issues. The topics discussed during these meetings included promoting inter-cultural awareness and combating racism and xenophobia; education; social inclusion and access to public services; employment and pathways to work; and active citizenship. In addition, suggestions which were made in the context of written contributions have been collated and circulated to the relevant Departments and associated agencies for consideration. Work on the development of the updated integration strategy is ongoing and I expect that a draft strategy will be sent to key stakeholders for their observations before the summer, with a view to the strategy being published as soon as possible thereafter. I hope that the resulting recommendations on migrant integration will form the basis of a new and more comprehensive overarching strategy, which is capable of meeting present needs and expected future conditions of society. According to Census 2011, we have a situation where non-Irish nationals account for more than 500,000 or 12% of the population and where there has been a rapid growth in the non-Irish population in the past decade or so. We now have people from more than 199 countries living in the State. This can pose challenges but it can also provide opportunities. There have, unfortunately, been circumstances where individuals have experienced racism and xenophobia. I want to be clear in expressing my views on such behaviour - it is not acceptable and we will do everything possible to combat it. I am aware there have been calls for the legislation on racism to be reviewed and this issue is a topic which is being looked at by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in terms of its ongoing work on integration, multiculturalism and combating racism. I fully expect that the legislation to combat racism will be considered in the context of the outcome of the review of the Oireachtas committee and following publication of the Government's integration strategy. In the meantime, I urge those who are affected by manifestations of racism to report the matter to the appropriate authorities. I am aware of the excellent work that NGOs in this sector have been doing in providing support and assistance for those who have been victims of racism, for which I commend them. Of equal importance is their advocacy role in opposition to racism and in seeking to keep the focus of Government and of society generally on this problem. I am pleased that the motion commends the holding of the PolskaÉire Festival 2015. This is an initiative I have had in mind for some time because I saw it as important to recognise the Polish influence in present day Ireland. It is estimated that there are 150,000 Polish citizens living in the State, resulting in Polish becoming the second most widely spoken language here. It also seemed to me to be a worthwhile exercise in furthering integration of Poles in Irish society and promoting contact between Irish, Polish and other nationalities, through a range of cultural, artistic, social, sports and other events and catering for different age groups. I thought it would be a good idea if the festival was organised on the occasion of the Republic of Ireland v. Poland international, and that proved to be the case. I arranged for funding for elements of the festival from the two Departments in which I am Minister of State. However, I thank the Polish Embassy, the FAI, Dublin City Council and other local authorities, the Irish-Polish Society, Polish associations such as Forum Polonia, sports clubs, SIPTU and cultural groups across the country - in short, anyone and everyone who organised events or participated in what was a successful festival. Despite what other members of my party might say, RTE was particularly supportive of the events last week.  With regard to the amendment tabled by Senators David Cullinane, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Kathryn Reilly, as Senators will be aware, I have a personal commitment to reforming the direct provision system. Alongside my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I established a working group on the protection process. The work of this group is ongoing and it will report back in the coming weeks with a suggested path of reforms. However, I cannot accept the amendment. Indeed, some of the matters referred to fall outside my remit in the Department. I appreciate that these are important issues and if the Senators want to outline their concerns in writing to me, I will ensure that they are brought to the attention of the Minister. On a personal note, I thank those who were involved in the festival, which has become the first PolskaÉire Festival. It was intended to be a once-off occasion because it would centre around the soccer international but that changed over the course of the week of the events, which are still ongoing because there are events around the country and the film festival in Smithfield this week has all of a sudden become the first Polish-Irish festival. There is a new plaque on O'Connell Street to Pawe Edmund Strzelecki, who did a massive amount of famine relief work here in the 1840s and is credited with saving the lives of 200,000 children in Ireland during that period. The plaque, a monument, if one likes, to the PolskaÉire Festival, will last for a long time, and great credit is due to the Irish-Polish Society for organising it. We always have had people come to this country who have contributed to Ireland. One can go back to St. Patrick. One can look at the seven signatories to the Proclamation, two of whom were born outside Ireland and two others of whom were sons of migrants. It is a fantastic opportunity for us. As I have said this on quite a number of occasions, I feel sorry for the Polish representatives in the Gallery who have heard so many similar speeches of mine in the past ten days or so, but, if I might, I will continue along that vein. The country that I grew up in was a particularly boring, stale, mono-cultural one, a country that people wanted to leave. Many of us in this House will have friends and family living abroad who have found a country outside of Ireland that they decided to call home. I was taken by something an Italian Minister said at an EU event recently, that he wanted Italy to be the best place in the world for Italian-born people. That is something we have to do for ourselves in the hope Ireland might be the best place in which Irish people can live. However, from a situation where, in 1996, 0.5% of the population were born outside the State, now 12% were. It is a wonderfully enriching and exciting for us to have that shared experience. The thousands of years of history that have brought the Polish nation to this point is now our history too. While the Polish people go through a period of reflection on the 70 years since the end of the Second World War and we are going through our period of reflection, I am so excited about the new identity of being Polish-Irish. I said this on quite a few occasions that we are so used to the idea of being Irish-American but we have never necessarily come to the realisation that there is a whole new body of people in the country who are comfortable with the idea of being Hungarian-Irish, Czech-Irish, Moldovan-Irish or Polish-Irish. We have started something wonderful with this conversation this week. We talked with young people about where they are with that internal friction between two identities and how they can celebrate it and move on from it. We have spoken about integration through sport, which, as Senator Hayden stated, is a fantastic avenue in which to connect and build bridges. We have used art and music. We have focused, not only on the constraints of a national identity but on what a national identity can do in terms of connecting with another human being.National identity is important, but one's humanity supersedes all of those elements. I thank Senators for allowing us discuss the nature of integration. I agree we have problems and issues to overcome. People have mentioned the issue of direct provision and that is something we discussed at the joint committee earlier today. There are obviously issues to be discussed in regard to the protection system. Not everybody has the same mindset when it comes to the issue of migration and our political system does not give itself enough credit for its achievements. Look for example at what is happening across the water in the British general election and how immigration is front and centre of that debate. Look too at what is happening in France and Germany. The European Union is under a greater strain now, despite being the greatest political movement of the past 100 years and bringing people together with the common goal for a peaceful Europe. Our system, regardless of political party affiliations, has not been strangled by the issue of immigration and we should hold on to, cherish and build on this for the future.

I agree with the Minister of State there are many elements to it. The PolskaÉire festival is a wonderful addition to our calendar and I hope it will go from strength to strength. However, initiatives like this do not equate to a policy or strategy. As has been confirmed, there is no national integration strategy or formal policy document yet. Therefore, it is fair to conclude that we have significant rhetoric on the issue, but not enough action. We had a long debate earlier today about the direct provision system and the Minister of State repeated again today the statement he made previously, namely, that he will not stand over that system. I welcome that statement. However, the 4,000 plus people in that system have seen little change to their ongoing nightmare of living in direct provision accommodation. I also note that nothing has changed for the estimated 30,000 undocumented people living and working in Ireland. The fact that Sue Conlan, CEO of the Irish Refugee Council, recently resigned from the Government's working group to reform the protection process is serious. Her reasons for doing so were to do with serious concerns about the overriding purpose of the general scheme of the International Protection Bill published on 25 March 2015. In announcing the heads of the Bill, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, stated the "single procedure" and other reforms will allow for earlier identification of people who need international protection and those who can be returned to their country of origin. While early identification of refugees is clearly to be welcomed, the "single procedure" envisaged in the heads of the Bill is as much, if not more, concerned with speedy decisions leading to deportation as it is with early identification of refugees. The emphasis should be on a "single protection procedure" to ensure that people at risk of persecution or serious harm are granted permission to remain in Ireland. Only when that has been fully completed should there be any consideration of other reasons that could give rise to Ireland's obligations under other international conventions. Indeed Sue Conlan stated "this is an International Protection Bill and it should not be used as a means of enforcing immigration control." In addition, the complete absence of any reference to "direct provision" in the Bill is a lost opportunity, since this has been the source of both national and international criticism since its inception. There is no legislative basis for the system of direct provision in Ireland. The current system was the brainchild of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government and is based on a combination of administrative decisions and ministerial and departmental circulars. The estimated cost for direct provision to the State in 2014 was €51 million. That is just under €12,000 per resident, none of which is paid to asylum seekers themselves but rather goes to private operators who run the State's 34 direct provision centres. This is now a very lucrative business, with some speculators making profits in excess of €10.8 million, while accumulated profits come to €25 million. It is shocking to think that people are making what can only be described as immoral profit out of the misery and vulnerability of other human beings. The entire direct provision project is a costly and inhumane disaster that should be immediately phased out. Sinn Féin calls on the Minister to begin the immediate phasing out of the system over a 12-month period. In the interim, oversight of the system should be given to the Ombudsman for Children and to the Office of the Ombudsman, with immediate effect. The Committee of Public Accounts should be given responsibility for oversight of all financial transactions relating to the system. There should be an immediate move to self-catering within the current system as this would give some degree of dignity and autonomy to residents. The policy of dispersal should cease immediately and residents should be entitled to apply for and receive State welfare transfers. Asylum seekers should be allowed to work while awaiting a decision on their application for leave to remain. In the light of the appalling waste and tragedy that is direct provision and in the light of the additional factor of 30,000 undocumented people living in the shadows, how can any thinking person take the fanciful notion of integration seriously. I commend the work of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, and other groups on these issues. With all due respect, the Minister of State and the Government's use of the term "integration" is simply the empty and meaningless rhetoric of the cult of multiculturalism. What fanciful and liberal sounding words "multiculturalism" and "integration" are. Who could possibly be against them? Strip them away however, and the reality of life for thousands of immigrants in Ireland is one of human desperation, fear and hopelessness. Therefore, let us at least have the basic decency not to pretend that some fancy integration policy with all the right buzz words is a sign of our commitment to justice and fairness when it comes to asylum seekers and non-EU immigrants. If we are to take ourselves seriously as legislators, there is an obligation on us to deal with the structural and institutional underbelly of immigration. It is insulting and downright disingenuous of us to pretend we care, when in reality we are prepared to stand over clear abuses of human rights while at the same time utilising the full rigours of the State to introduce draconian immigration legislation. Indeed, perhaps, we would be far better off forgetting the shallow rhetoric of integration and remembering instead, that there is no such thing as an illegal human being. I am very concerned about a motion that is to come before this House tomorrow. It is being brought forward by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and was debated in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform today. This proposal will reduce freedom of information access in regard to the Refugee Appeals Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and will limit any FOI requests in their regard from October 2014. This is a retrograde step. It certainly begs the question as to why there is such a reinforcing of the veil of secrecy around the Department of Justice and Equality when it comes to issues concerning refuge and asylum. This is a sinister and retrograde step and I call on all Senators to oppose this motion tomorrow. It is appalling that it is even coming before us. I welcome the positive steps being made, but positive engagements and initiatives certainly do not equate to a policy and integration strategy. I hope that when the Minister of State comes back to us with a strategy, we can have a fuller debate on all issues related to people living in Ireland today.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	252	I commend the Labour Party for tabling this Private Members' motion. We in this House cannot speak often enough of the importance of integration. I thank the Fine Gael lead speaker, Senator Catherine Noone, for outlining Fine Gael's support for this motion on integration and for the celebration of it, the PolskaÉire festival. I also wish to acknowledge the members of the Polish community in the Visitors Gallery. I have been privileged to have been able to employ a number of Polish people in business in County Clare. These have been some of the most amazing people I have met and their commitment to our society and community is second to none. They are involved in everything, including a fashion show for the GAA in which one of my Polish staff was a model. She was a great hit and as a result has been approached by some agency that may poach her. The best of luck to her. If that happens, I will be delighted for her. Our society has developed incredibly. Today, representatives from the Immigration Control Platform spoke at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality about the European policy on integration and people from other communities. It would be an understatement to say their contributions were shocking.To think they speak for a portion of people in our society who believe we need to limit integration and close our minds to difference is shocking. Áine Ní Chonaill and her colleague got a gruelling in the justice committee. I have to admire their use of language because in their opening submission they spoke about an armada of ships crossing the Mediterranean but the Chairman, Deputy David Stanton, asked them if they thought these people might be crossing the Mediterranean because they are in fear of their lives in their own countries, particularly in Syria, and are prepared to risk their lives, not because they want to leave their own country - if they had a choice I am sure they would want to stay in their own countries - but because they fear for their lives and are prepared to risk their lives for the chance of a better life and a better future. However, that did not seem to register at all with them. That discussion was held today in one part of these Houses but, thankfully, we are having a much more positive discussion in the Seanad Chamber. I agree with Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh that there are many things we have not got right in this country but that is not because of politicians. It is the effect of integration of our people where there is an understanding of alternative culture. I note the Minister's comment that Polish is the second language here in terms of the numbers of people speaking it, which is remarkable. It is an indication of the way society has moved on, but there is an underbelly in this society that need to engage and that have a journey to travel. I hope that, over time, they will travel that journey and embrace the different cultures and opportunities that are at their doorsteps in every town and village in this country. People are not born nasty or insular. Circumstances have led to that and it is our job to promote the circumstances that create tolerance, integration and the type of society where everybody lives together in harmony supporting each other. I have spoken regularly about the disgraceful situation that is direct provision here. Frankly, the Government did nothing about direct provision until the Minister of State, became Minister of State with responsibility for equality and other areas. We are doing something now. It is shocking that we wasted three years in government during which we could have done something about it, but we did not.  This House was not shy in highlighting the issues and the disgraceful conditions in direct provision. An all-party Oireachtas group of Senators, which met on a regular basis led by Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, our colleague, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, and others, were pounding away but getting nowhere until Deputy Aodháin Ó Ríordáin became Minister of State. I have absolute faith that in the lifetime of this Government, and I hope well in advance of then, this issue will be dealt with. I put down that challenge to the Minister of State, to which I know he is committed. However, being committed to it is one thing; delivering on that commitment is something else. I believe we will see the second part of that now, the first part being the commitment to set up the review groups and so forth. I sincerely hope those on this side of the House will be able to face into the next general election without the disgraceful legacy of direct provision, having done nothing about it. I understand the reason Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh felt it necessary to table the amendment but I am sure he realises, as we do, that a sincere commitment has been given now and I hope he will reflect that sincere commitment by not pressing the amendment. He has made his point very well. There is a good deal happening, and it is not just fancy language. Thousands of Polish people across the country engaged with the recent PolskaÉire Festival. They spoke about nothing else for weeks in advance of it. I commend the people who rolled up their sleeves and got involved in organising it. I know it will become an annual event, and I sincerely hope many more Irish people will partake in future PolskaÉire festivals because it is all about integration and understanding. I suggest to other communities, such as the Czech community of which there are thousands here, that they should consider having a Czech festival. Other minority groups-----

I appreciate that the Minister of State has a rather mixed bag of portfolios which make great demands on his time. However, the PolskaÉire event is an example of the way he has managed to marry parts of the new community and a cultural event thereby breaking down the silos that sometimes are to be found, not least in Departments but also in the wider world where people often perceive politics being played in separate pieces. The Minister has successfully crossed over that. I am aware much of that is driven by his love of football, and it would be unfair of us not to acknowledge that because when people bring their personal passion and love of something to bear, it often encourages other people to come forward. People then know that the Minister of State is doing it for the right reasons. The Minister of State has successfully married other areas of culture with his great love of football. I am sure there are many people around the country who genuinely appreciate that and as my colleague said, it is hoped the PolskaÉire Festival will become an annual event which will be broadened to include other communities that have come to live in Ireland to be part of our culture and have an opportunity to share and learn from each other. In The Model art centre in Sligo, for example, members of the communities living in direct provision centres have had celebrations of their cultural interest in food at weekends. They did that to show us that we all enjoy eating, which is a great way to get people around the table to share food from another country and talk about how they make it thereby breaking down the barriers that sometimes exist. That is a small initiative. I ask the Minister of State to forgive me for not knowing whether he had a big food piece in this event.

Perhaps there is an opportunity to extend the food part because it is genuinely a place for people to go, particularly for people who do not like football, if I can say that in a whisper-----

Food is a basic thing but such events allow people to come forward and they have a strong part to play. The Minister of State has spent a good deal of the afternoon engaging with the oversight committee on the question of direct provision. That work is ongoing and I know that the Minister of State is constrained in what he can say until the working group reports. He has trusted the members of that group to do the work and report, and many people are awaiting that, but I know that he is personally determined that change will come because we must have change. Members of this and the other House have said that and I will not repeat it, other than to add my voice also. The Minister of State and I visited Globe House in Sligo and heard the many stories directly. We know that the Minister of State is determined to make that change on which he has the support probably of every Member of this House and the other House. However, when that report is published, we must not have another report that merely outlines all the other things we need to do and it passes on to another phase where nobody does anything.That is the one thing I would urge. Whatever else the Minister of State may set out to achieve, taking the report and making it happen will be something that he has our support for and it is something I would like to see. I am grateful to him for his support of the Yeats 2015 celebration. It would be remiss of me not to mention Yeats. As much as he can talk about football, I can talk about Yeats. We have found there is a great deal of cultural involvement by communities across Ireland. Last weekend I was in Wicklow and then I drove to Sligo to celebrate Yeats in both places on the same day. About 80 events, at a minimum, are happening around the world which has been achieved with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Culture Ireland and others. It is another opportunity for us to share and invite others into the celebration of something that is very important to us. The Minister of State has assisted us in that matter and we look forward to seeing him at other events later on in the year. Yeats 2015 is a great opportunity, in Ireland, to celebrate cultural wealth and heritage and contemporary cultural wealth which is extraordinary over the course of the year. I enjoyed hearing the young Yeats Cup performers who participated in Feis Shligigh at the weekend. Even though the performers were aged between 14 and 18 they gave extraordinary renditions of complex Yeats poetry. That proves that there is a new generation always coming through who wants to take his poetry with them. We have a great future and there is a lot happening. I commend what the Minister of State has done. Above all, we look forward to the direct provision report being a game-changer and that he would be the player in achieving same.

#KathrynReilly	unknown-#KathrynReilly-party	unknown-#KathrynReilly-dob	unknown-#KathrynReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	262	I welcome the Minister of State. I second the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, on the humanitarian crisis in the direct provision system. I am from Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan. While Paddy Reilly never came back to us, to reference the song, we have had a multicultural society in Ballyjamesduff for the past few years. I welcome all of those new communities. They have integrated well into the community which has enriched the lives of the people in my town, as well as the county of Cavan. Before proceeding, I welcome the people in the Visitors Gallery.  I will not labour the point but shall reiterate some of the points made by my colleague. In terms of the monitoring reports on integration produced by the ESRI and the integration centre, I will highlight some of the main points mentioned in its most recent report as it is important to mention them in the Seanad.  In terms of the report, the authors found the following - non-Irish nationals experience higher rates of unemployment than Irish nationals; there is no difference between English speaking and non-Irish national students and Irish students in mean scores for reading ability nor is there any significant difference between the two groups regarding achievements in maths; both consistent poverty and at-risk-of-poverty rates were similar for Irish and non-Irish nationals; non-Irish nationals have a slightly lower median income than Irish nationals; and non-Irish nationals tended to report better health than Irish nationals. However, it needs to be borne in mind that there is a greater proportion of young people among non-Irish nationals than Irish nationals.  I congratulate the Minister of State on the success of PolskaÉire in 2015. From all the recollections and reports I have heard about it it went down well. I cannot go too much into the football element because I am not an avid football player. I have two left feet and if I played football, I would probably end up tripping myself on the pitch.

The aim of the PolskaÉire festival was to champion the diversity that the Polish people bring to Ireland. I congratulate the Minister of State and his Department on achieving that aim. I said I would not labour too long on certain points because my colleague has already highlighted some of the issues, especially the direct provision system.

I thank the Minister of State for attending and giving us a comprehensive account of what is being done on integration. I thank him, in particular, for his personal description of the PolskaÉire festival, its highlights and so on. Mr. Martin O'Prey from his office is seated in the Visitors Gallery with visitors and he deserves a special thanks. I also thank the visitors, including Senator Catherine Noone's cousin, for coming in and for all the work they have done on the PolskaÉire festival. As the proposer of the motion, I know that Senator Aideen Hayden will join with me in making no apology for what is an unashamedly positive motion and for using language of commendation for the Minister of State, PolskaÉire festival and the work done on integration. We have had a long and fractious week in the Seanad when we debated other issues. It is appropriate that we would, on this particular issue, adopt a celebratory tone. Very positive comments, generally, have been made by colleagues across the floor. I hope the amendment will not be pressed. We have had plenty of opportunity in this House to debate direct provision and we will again do so because all of us feel strongly about the matter. On the issue of undocumented migrants, I have worked with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland on the matter and I know many other colleagues have done the same. We will have other opportunities to speak on this matter. I note that Senator Susan O'Keeffe has made the point that the direct provision report should be a game-changer. I hope that when it is published, we will have an opportunity to debate it with the Minister of State in this House. That would be the appropriate time for us to debate the tos and fros of what reforms need to be made in the direct provision system. On this occasion, we are looking at the positive benefits of integration that have resulted from inward migration to Ireland. We are commending and congratulating those involved in the PolskaÉire festival. As many have said, we hope to see its success replicated in the future. The gauntlet has been thrown to me, as somebody who is Czech-Irish, which I shall take on. I hope a CzechÉire festival will be organised in due course.  There are challenges, as in any community. Ireland has experienced quite rapid net inward migration which was partly due to the boom but it has consolidated since. Senator Aideen Hayden and others, as well as the Minister of State, spoke about the need to tackle racism. There have been some ugly incidents of racism which all of us acknowledge. It is also important to acknowledge that we have not seen the sort of vicious, organised, racist and political movements that have, most unfortunately, come forward in other European countries. We have been fortunate that has not happened and that is due to a quite a number of factors. We should cherish the absence of such a movement and the generally positive outlook extended towards people in new communities. The expression "new communities" is somewhat problematic in many ways but it is used in a positive sense which is important. As others have said, there are challenges in terms of direct provision. Senator Martin Conway correctly pointed out that there has been a particular drive to tackle the challenges of direct provision and to reform the system since the Minister of State has come to office. I am glad to see such a development. We all welcome the development and look forward to the report.  Clearly, undocumented migrants is a major issue. Recently the Taoiseach visited the United States and spoke to President Obama about the plight of the undocumented Irish in that country. It is important that we work on the issue here and I know the Minister of State has given a personal commitment to do so. The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has also done great work on the issue.  Other colleagues mentioned the issue of low pay for migrant workers. In fact, the Annual Monitoring Report on Integration reports generally positive outcomes for children of migrants in education in Ireland. It also reports a generally positive experience of migrant communities in employment. Many of the migrant population and new communities are engaged in highly skilled work and in well paid sectors which is important to acknowledge. Low pay is an issue. The low pay commission established by the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash, has a representative from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland. SIPTU has also done a great deal of work for young migrant workers and was actively engaged in the PolskaÉire festival. I know because the matter arose at an event SIPTU organised to take place in Liberty Hall as part of the festival. It is important to note that we are addressing the challenges. It is not that we are unaware of the challenges on both sides of the house but we need to bring a positive approach to bear.  All of my colleagues who spoke were very positive about the benefits of diversity and the need to celebrate our blended identities as Polish-Irish or Czech-Irish people. As we sit here in the Seanad this evening, with a portrait by a Polish count outside the Chamber, and inside with three chandeliers made by Waterford Glass which has had such a strong input from the Czech-Irish community, it is good that we celebrate diversity, the great benefits of our new communities and of greater integration in Irish society.
