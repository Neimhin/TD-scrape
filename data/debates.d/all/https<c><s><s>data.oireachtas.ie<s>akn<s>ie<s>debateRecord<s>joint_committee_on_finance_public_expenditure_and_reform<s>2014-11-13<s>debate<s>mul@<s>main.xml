          <p eId="para_14">I welcome Mr. Jim Brown, chief executive of Ulster Bank, who is accompanied by Mr. Stephen Bell, chief risk officer, and Ms Ellvena Graham, head of business banking.  Mr. Brown will make an opening statement.  Questions from members were collated in advance of the meeting and these were submitted to Ulster Bank.  I thank Mr. Brown and his staff for responding in writing to these questions.  The responses were received yesterday and have been distributed to members.  Together with the input of the witnesses today, it is hoped that all the key topics will have been covered.  None the less, a question and answer session will follow to clarify any matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Jim Brown<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">I thank members of the committee for the opportunity to provide an update on Ulster Bank's progress and to address the areas outlined in the invitation from the committee.  I will make a brief statement and I will respond to any specific issues the committee wishes to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">  Ulster Bank is the third largest financial institution in the Republic of Ireland.  We are unique as the only systemic bank operating across both the Republic and Northern Ireland that is owned by an international parent with a global network.  We are an integral part of the financial and social economies in both jurisdictions and we believe that a healthy and functioning financial services sector is essential to a vibrant, competitive and sustainable economy.  We recognise and greatly appreciate our role and responsibilities in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">  Ulster Bank has a significant presence across the island of Ireland.  We employ more than 5,500 people in a network of 199 branches and serve almost 2 million customers.  We have lending in excess of €27 billion in the Irish economy and hold approximately €25 billion in customer deposits.  We also hold strong market positions across the business with improving trends in all areas.  Over recent years we have had a clear strategy to manage our legacy issues while at the same time build a really good bank for our customers.  On that point, I reiterate my comments yesterday in accepting the fine imposed by the Central Bank as a result of its findings following the IT incident.  I am pleased to confirm that since then we have invested heavily in both our governance and systems to avoid any similar incident happening again.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">  Our strategy is working with a number of tangible results.  First, early this year we returned to profit.  Our most recent quarter 3 results continue to demonstrate this progress, with an adjusted operating profit of €569 million in the year to date.  Most important, these results demonstrate our continued focus on the needs of our customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">  On business lending, our €1.2 billion Ahead for Business fund has provided almost €1.1 billion of credit into the market to the end of September.  We have just launched a series of new fixed-rate mortgages and we expect to provide approximately €500 million in mortgage financing this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">  We are also making considerable progress on mortgage arrears and have achieved month-on-month reductions in arrears every month for the past 19 months.  My team and I have constantly, consistently and publicly affirmed our core objective, which is that we want to keep co-operating customers in their homes.  I am pleased to confirm that in excess of 8,000 customers who had been in arrears are now up to date with payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Second, the committee will be aware that Ulster Bank recently passed the comprehensive assessment undertaken by the European Central Bank. This demonstrates the progress we have made in recent years in strengthening our balance sheet, a process which has continued through 2014. Since the effective date of the review we have further increased our common equity tier 1 ratio to 17.3%, a figure which we believe to be the strongest capital position of all full-service banks in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Looking to the future, the recent announcement by RBS confirming Ulster Bank's core status and good strategic fit with its retail and commercial banking businesses is a key development and proof of a commitment to Ulster Bank as an integral part of RBS. It is important to note that this decision was based on the assessment that Ulster Bank has strong potential and is capable of making an appropriate return. Following this commitment, we will continue with a dual strategy of strengthening our market-leading position in Northern Ireland through greater alignment with the United Kingdom while building a challenger bank in Ireland. Our ambition is to become the No. 1 bank for customer service throughout the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Before I conclude and take questions, I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our observations on the recent announcement of the Central Bank regarding new mortgage lending. A rebound in property prices following a crisis is not unusual and we recognise the need for the Central Bank to take steps to avoid overheating in the credit and property markets. However, the proposals as they stand will impact on the ability of many first-time buyers to acquire homes. In addition to this, other hopeful first-time buyers will struggle to save a high deposit while paying increasing rents. We estimate that 68% of the first-time buyer mortgages approved by Ulster Bank this year would have fallen outside the proposed loan-to-value or loan-to-income criteria. The economy and marketplace in a country such as Ireland are dependent on a fully functioning mortgage market, and we welcome the opportunity to contribute to the consultation on how best to achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Let me reiterate that Ulster Bank is and will remain an integral part of RBS and is fully committed to the island of Ireland. Following the comprehensive assessment by the European Central Bank, we believe we hold the strongest capital position of all the full-service banks in Ireland. We have a clear strategy. We have returned to profit and we are making strong progress towards becoming a simpler, more efficient and sustainable bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> We actively support the mortgage and business markets by providing increased lending and specialist sector support. We look forward to continuing our progress in 2015 and to supporting the recovery in the economy as a challenger bank that provides much-needed competition to the market.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">I propose that we adhere to the same rules as for our meetings with the other banks.  This will ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask questions so that we can have the best meeting possible.  I propose that the lead speakers for each group will speak for ten minutes, followed by other committee members, who will have five minutes.  Then, anyone else who wishes to ask a question will have five minutes.  The clerk and myself will be keeping an eye on the clock, and I will advise members when there is one minute to go to allow them to wrap up while, hopefully, keeping within their time.  If members have further questions, I will be happy, time permitting, to allow them back in later once I have given others a fair opportunity to put their questions.  It does not serve the purpose of the committee to use the time to make statements and it does not give the witnesses the opportunity to respond properly.  Therefore, I ask members to keep their questions short and to the point.  I am asking for their co-operation on this to help the smooth running of the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">  The speakers who have indicated are Deputy Michael McGrath, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, Deputy Pearse Doherty, Senator Aideen Hayden and Deputy Paul Murphy, who will lead for the Technical Group.  After that I will open it up to other members.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">I welcome Mr. Brown and his colleagues and I thank him for his opening remarks.  I was disappointed with the questionnaire Ulster Bank returned to us.  The bank appears to have taken a minimalist approach in terms of the responses.  The bank cited commercial sensitivity eight times as a reason for not answering the questions.  It was the last response we received from any of the banks.  I have to say, regrettably, that I regard it as being of the poorest quality.  At times the bank provided web links instead of copying the information, forcing us to go and look up various web pages.  That is disappointing, and I am unsure why the bank took that approach.  Anyway, that is my honest observation.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">  I will start by asking Mr. Brown about the fine from the Central Bank of €3.5 million in respect of the information technology failure that occurred in the summer of 2012, which was obviously a major issue for the bank's customers.  It was a damning finding by the Central Bank against Ulster Bank.  It found that the bank failed to have robust governance arrangements in respect of IT systems and that this threatened confidence in the operation of the retail banking sector.  The Central Bank said that outsourcing was no defence for regulatory failings.  It saw fit to impose the highest fine it has ever imposed and it reprimanded the bank.  Ulster Bank has accepted the findings.  What steps have been taken since then by Ulster Bank and its parent company to address the underlying causes of the crisis?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. Jim Brown<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">The key root cause of the incident related to a software failure that happened as a result of an upgrade to the system that processed the transactions.  That was replaced quickly, but since then RBS has spent £750 million on upgrading the resilience of the systems overall and ensuring that a backup system is completely in place.  Furthermore, we have the ability to run the Ulster Bank transactions completely separate from those of the rest of the group.  A significant amount of investment has gone into this.  The investment has been overseen by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is tracking progress to ensure that it is in place as we have committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">  Separately, we have improved governance within Ulster Bank so that we have better oversight on the IT arrangements that exist in RBS.  We have a specific IT person working for Ulster Bank who is heavily involved in determining the IT priorities for RBS as well as monitoring the performance of the systems and the backup plans, as I have commented previously.  We have seen a considerable amount of work and significant investment, with improved governance in the bank too.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">Yes.  A total of €59 million was the cost to Ulster Bank customers in Ireland.  We also had redress costs, since the bank had to provide redress to customers in Ireland.  We had further compensation to pay to customers who were affected in Northern Ireland as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I will move on to the issue of standard variable interest rates.  Let us compare the rates Ulster Bank is charging in Ireland with the offering it is making to customers in Northern Ireland.  There is quite a difference.  The bank has not disclosed its cost of funds in its response to us, but based on the information we have from the other banks I am assuming it is in the region of 1% to 1.5%.  Why is there such a difference between the cost of variable-rate mortgages in Ireland and those in the North, particularly at low LTV ratios?  With a scenario of 50% or 60% LTV, people seem to be able to get a far better deal in Northern Ireland than here.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The standard variable rate that we charge in Northern Ireland reflects the market, our cost of funds and our costs of operating in that market.  The rate is 4.0%.  We also have a loan establishment fee for any new loans in Northern Ireland of £995.  In Ireland our standard variable rate is 4.5% and we do not have any establishment fee.  That said, the standard variable rate reflects the cost of providing variable rate mortgages in the market.  It comprises our cost of funds, our operating costs, the costs of credit and the costs in terms of remediating customers who are non-performing as well.  Our cost of funds is approximately the same as for the other banks in this market.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">The cost of deposits in Northern Ireland is approximately half what it is in the South. There is a higher cost for funds paid to customers in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">The Deputy is correct; we do keep them constantly under review.  Having said that, we are mindful of competition in the market.  We went to the market three or four weeks ago with what I would regard as very competitive three, five and seven-year fixed-rate mortgages, priced from 3.99%, that are available to new as well as existing customers.  We keep our rates constantly under review.</p>

The interest rates that we charge on our standard variable loans range from 3.7% to 4.5%, and that reflects the risk we are taking on in those particular lines.

          <p eId="para_49">With regard to Mr. Brown's answer to the question on mortgage arrears in the questionnaire, Ulster Bank has almost 4,700 customers whose principal dwelling houses are the legal area of voluntary surrender or assisted voluntary sale.  That seems to be a high number of loans that the bank is pursuing, which will result in the loss of these homes in many cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">On the last occasion when we appeared before the committee, we said we expected that the bulk of the cases that went into the legal department would go in quite early, and that has been the case.  Only approximately 500 additional cases have gone in this year - that is, as of the end of October 2014.  We are seeing a very significant slowdown in cases in which we have to take that action.  We remain committed to keeping people in their homes and I am pleased to say that we have seen an increase in engagement from customers.  Perhaps it has taken the threat of legal action to stimulate that engagement, but we have seen between 45% and 50% of customers making contact or starting to make some level of payment as a result of our taking this action.  While it is regrettable, we would not anticipate that number of cases flowing through into repossession.  We hope the process will stimulate engagement contact and re-establishment of an appropriate payment.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">My last question is about the proposed new rules from the Central Bank.  Mr. Brown gave quite a stark statistic in his opening statement, stating that 68% of first-time buyer mortgages approved by Ulster Bank this year would have fallen outside the new rules.  That means that almost seven out of ten people who were approved for a mortgage from Ulster Bank would have fallen foul of the new rules.  Is that the essence of what he said?</p>

          <p eId="para_57">I welcome Mr. Brown and his colleagues to the committee.  I too was disappointed that of the 42 questions in the questionnaire, eight were effectively not replied to.  I understand that the Irish taxpayer has not put money into Ulster Bank, unlike the other three banks, two of which have appeared before the committee to date.  Nevertheless, Ulster Bank is regulated by the Central Bank.  There are key questions such as the cost of funds, which would give us some indication of how the mortgage rate discharged to consumers is based on the cost of funds.  People are entitled to know the cost of funds.  No breakdown has been given of the profile of mortgage lending in terms of fixed-rate, variable rate and tracker mortgages.  We have no indication of the bank's net interest margin, which the other banks have given to us.  Would Mr. Brown consider, on mature reflection, providing the committee with the average cost of borrowing and the blended cost of borrowing, the breakdown of fixed-rate, tracker and variable rate mortgages and the net interest margin, so that we can get a view on it?</p>
          <p eId="para_58">  I understand the view that there is a lack of competition in the mortgage market in the Republic of Ireland.  Mr. Brown said that most of Ulster Bank's new mortgage business this year would not have met the new restrictions proposed by the Central Bank, including the requirement for a 20% deposit, yet he states that Ulster Bank is the only bank with a structured presence in the North and in the South.  We see a difference in the mortgage rates if the loan-to-value ratio is less than 60%: the rate in the Republic, at 3.9%, is two percentage points higher than the rate in Northern Ireland, at 1.89%.  The bank is reacting to the market.  I would appreciate if Mr. Brown would deal with these questions: first, the cost of borrowing; second, the breakdown between fixed-rate, variable rate and tracker mortgages; and third, the net interest margin.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">Mr. Brown is able to break down the costs of borrowings in terms of giving an explanation as to why there is a lower charge in the North than in the Republic.  By definition, therefore, Mr. Brown should be able to give us a breakdown of the difference in net interest margin between the North and the Republic.  He is relying on a global composite picture for the net interest margin across the group, yet he is giving an explanation for why the bank is giving a lower rate in the North based on the cost of funds being less in the North than in the Republic.  To be consistent, he might give us a breakdown of the net interest margin between the Republic and the North.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">That is commercially sensitive, so we will not publish it.  It is not in the public domain, but we have published the net interest margin as 2.32% across Ulster Bank.  As I mentioned, the cost of variable rate mortgages in Northern Ireland is 4% versus 4.5% in this market.  There are fees that are charged in Northern Ireland as well.  The cost of deposits is significantly higher in the Republic versus Northern Ireland as well.  If one looks at the deposit rates versus the mortgage rates plus the fees that get charged, there is not much difference between the two.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">Mr. Brown is being a little selective.  It is correct with regard to the standard variable rate, but when one looks at loan-to-value rates below 60%, there is a significant difference between the Republic and the Northern Ireland market.  There is a 2% differential.  My point is that Ulster Bank is reacting to competition in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">  To make a general observation, what must be examined at Central Bank and Department of Finance level is whether there is sufficient competition in the Irish mortgage market.  Even at 2.32%, with due respect to Mr. Brown, it is reasonable to make the assumption that Ulster Bank is making quite good margins relative to its competitors in the Republic of Ireland market.  If that is the case, why are the bank's rates not more competitive?</p>

I have two questions.  First, what rate would Mr. Brown like to reach for net interest margin?  Second, in light of the fact that AIB is operating from a lower net interest margin, which it told the committee is 1.6%, will Ulster Bank consider providing some competition in the Irish market and reducing the rates?</p>

          <p eId="para_97">  In terms of the net interest margin, I have told the committee previously that there must be in excess of 2.5% for all banks across the sector if the banking sector is to make a reasonable return in this market.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">The issue two years ago was huge and impacted on many customers, North and South.  There have been other issues in the bank in respect of IT.  This year the bank miscalculated tax relief for 7,500 customers and it is now imposing a penalty on them for that miscalculation by the bank.  If Mr. Brown understands how stretched people are in terms of disposable income, the mistake the bank made and the benefit it conferred on them has more than likely been spent.  Trying to claw that back, and it amounts to more than €300 in a year, is a sizeable burden.  Given that it was the bank that made the error, why did it not take the hit?</p>

          <p eId="para_119">  As regards the interest calculation, I acknowledge that there was an incident where we had not charged the full interest that we should have charged and we have charged customers subsequent to that.

          <p eId="para_120">In plain terms, the bank is making a mess of it.  It screwed over - excuse my language - its customers, who still remain loyal to the bank, for months on end two years ago.  It then miscalculated 7,500 people's mortgage interest tax relief.  They got a benefit which the bank is now claiming back, something which it fails to understand.  On top of that, it had to apologise to 1,300 customers because it miscalculated their repayments the year before.  There is a trend of error after error being made in the bank, and the person who has to suck it up is the customer.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">On the last question, the highest loan-to-value ratio is 90%.  On loan-to-income ratio, I understand we lend up to 4.5 times the income.  Some 85% of our loans are for an income multiple of 3.5 or less.  From our perspective, in terms of the Central Bank's recommendations, the loan-to-income rate is the key driver and we are quite comfortable with a rate of 3.5.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">  I cannot give a guarantee on branch closures.  We continue to review our network based on changes in customer behaviour.  We have invested heavily in alternative channels.  For example, this year we have done 7,000 web chat calls a month.  We have two banks on wheels in the Republic and will bring two more to Northern Ireland.  Transactions going through branches have decreased by €10 million, or 36%, since 2011, and footfall has fallen significantly.  The branch network reduced by 16% over that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">  On the other hand, we have seen digital banking increase by 140%.  There is a major shift towards digital transactions.  That said, branches are incredibly important to us and we conduct a lot of our more complex business in them, such as business and mortgage lending, investment advice and so on.  They still play a critical role in the business, but we have to respond to the reality of the changing market.</p>

          <from>Senator Aideen Hayden<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_141">I thank the delegation.  I want to express my disappointment at how late we received the bank's information.  I received the replies to our questions yesterday evening.  For the purposes of comparison, we received information from Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and AIB.  It is very disappointing to be given documentation so late in the day because we want to engage meaningfully with this process and it is very important for us to be able to review the questions we spend a lot of time putting together.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">  I will not go over the ground covered by my colleagues.  On the variable rate the banks are charging customers, there is a perception, with which the bank needs to deal, that it is making variable rate customers pay for tracker mortgages handed out by the bank when times were good.  From their point of view, the bank holds money belonging to ordinary people in current accounts on which, to the best of my knowledge, they are paid no interest.  The bad debts are reducing and the cost of funds has fallen.  From their point of view, there is no real excuse for continuing to, in effect, screw them.  That is how people see it, and it is something the bank needs to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">  Deputy Doherty referred to the level of arrears in the principal dwellings mortgage book.  It is utterly shocking that the bank is engaged in some 5,500 of what could be loosely termed "legal proceedings" out of a loan book of 12,723 mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days.  In response to an earlier question it was said that people will not engage in the process until they are on the steps of a court.  That is, in effect, telling people the bank is scaring them into participating in a process to resolve mortgage arrears, a scenario for which many people see the bank being as culpable as they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">  I spent years working as a solicitor.  For every mortgage product I handled, the bank did an independent valuation, paid for by the customer.  The customer paid for the cost of executing the mortgage deed and registering the bank's interest.  The proportion of cases in which the bank is engaging in legal proceedings is inordinately high and is much higher than that of the other financial institutions which have come before the committee.  The bank needs to examine its internal processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">This committee prepared a report on mortgage arrears and resolution processes and the clerk will give Mr. Brown a copy of that. It made several good recommendations which Ulster Bank should take on board, not least the AIB initiative to have an independent group of advisers to facilitate the re-engagement of customers with the process. All lenders should consider that proposal and fund it as AIB does. Ulster Bank has a problem if it is using legal proceedings against 5,000 out of 12,000 customers.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I understand that and we take this issue very seriously.  We are not happy to see any mortgage customer in distress.  As a consequence, we have put significant resources into helping alleviate that situation.  We have approximately 500 people working with customers who have mortgage arrears which is a sizeable percentage of the bank’s staff.  Those people make regular calls and send e-mails and letters, and we have people on the ground right through to the court process looking for customers to engage.  The majority of the 4,500 who have gone to court are in arrears for more than a year and have not engaged with us at all, despite the calls and contacts.  We have no choice if we want to resolve that situation but to go into the court process.  As we get into the process, customers are prepared to engage.  Every time we go to court we have someone there ready to talk to the customer to get him or her to re-engage.</p>

I chair a voluntary organisation that deals with people in the rental sector and I can assure Mr. Bell that rent receivers appointed to rental properties constitute a massive problem.  This committee recommended, and a recent report by DKM Economic Consultants for the Private Residential Tenancies Board also recommended, that rent receivers be obliged legally by a change in the law to step into the shoes of landlords.  We find that rent receivers come in, take the money, do not do essential repairs, evict people and do not give them their legal rights.

          <p eId="para_165">The economic concession is a product which lowers the interest rate to as low as 0.5% for a period as long as seven years to help customers reduce the amount they pay.  This allows them to pay down the capital outstanding on the mortgage because most of the payment is going to capital reduction and not interest servicing.  We have offered the split mortgage to all the customers who eventually took the economic concession option.  In almost every case the customers prefer the economic benefit of the economic concession to the split mortgage.  All of the 1,885 customers who have taken an economic concession would have been offered a split mortgage but have said "no".  We told the committee at the previous meeting that the total cost of credit the customer pays for a split mortgage is higher than for an economic concession.  This is a matter of fair choice from opportunities made available to the customer.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">Ulster Bank had a bad day yesterday with the maximum fine in this country, while in Britain and the United States its parent company, RBS, faces fines of hundreds of millions of pounds because of foreign exchange manipulation, coming on top of significant fines for rigging the London interbank offered rate, LIBOR, which I understand is still under investigation.  I am not sure whether the witnesses have read the chat transcripts from the traders talking about making free money and keeping numpties out of the market, which illustrate the kind of animal instincts and language of traders that supposedly had gone after the banking crisis, when there was a cultural change and an end to that kind of ethics.  Does what has come out in recent days, or years if we include LIBOR, not illustrate that there is no change of culture and that RBS represents some of the worst elements of banking culture that continue?</p>

          <p eId="para_226">  I was quite shocked by Senator Aideen Hayden’s point that the bank was taking 50% of those in arrears to court.  From my experience of working with Mr. David Hall, director of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, and a large number of people in arrears in Galway, I note that the bank is extremely slow in awarding restructuring.  It is so slow that people actually go into arrears, even though they have given plenty of notice of problems.  Customers are further disadvantaged by Ulster Bank in having its telephone operations based in Scotland.  Does the delegation agree with this?  A customer in difficulty tries to make a deal for a restructuring with the arrears support unit in the bank.  However, because the restructuring is not agreed to quickly enough, the customer falls into arrears and is then hassled by another wing of the bank’s operation for a payment he or she cannot afford - never the two wings shall meet.  The stress this heaps on people is unbelievable.  Just in the past week I have had cases of Ulster Bank customers in mortgage difficulty getting four text messages and telephone calls every day.  Is this acceptable?  Does the bank believe it has a duty to have better internal communications to better assist those genuinely engaging and seeking restructuring?</p>

Ours is the only bank that has had decreases in the number of customers in arrears for 19 months in a row.  It is also the only bank that has had 8,000 customers who were in arrears but who are now up to date, current, in their repayments.  Part of this has come about as a result of the fact that we hired 175 people in our Scottish operation to deal with arrears.  The reason we had to do this was we could not find any experienced collector in the Irish market.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">I would not recognise the charge that we are slower than other institutions to reach agreement.  We have invested significantly in simplifying and automating the standard financial statement, SFS, process.  Now, when customers contact us, it takes them less than 25 minutes to complete the SFS process.  When it was first launched, it took up to one hour.  The last thing a customer in arrears wants to do after finally making contact with his or her bank is to spend one hour filling in the paperwork and looking for bills in the top drawer.  We have taken much of this away and now run a voice-based telephony system which is based on trusting the customer to give the correct information.  We rely on this information until such time as it may be proved to be incorrect.  I do not recognise the charge that we are slow to offer solutions.  As Mr. Brown said, we have taken 8,000 customers out of being in arrears and have 7,000 customers in long-term arrangements.  Unfortunately, there are a number of customers with whom the legal process appears the only way to elicit the contact we need to make.  There is-----</p>

It could be as much as three quarters to a whole percentage point lower than interest rates.  As a follow-up to our first appearance before the committee, we showed that the total cost of credit was lower to the customer where there was an economic concession.

          <p eId="para_257">There is a key point which links into the Senator's previous questions.  The lesson we all have to learn from the mortgage arrears difficulties is that affordability should drive borrowing capacity, not loans to value.  There absolutely should be deposits, but the key is that we do not overstretch people from an income affordability point of view.  We fully support the Central Bank's indications concerning loans to income, but we are concerned about the potential, unintended consequences of expecting higher deposits for first-time buyers.</p>

Those factors need to be considered, but we will make our submission to the Central Bank on that.</p>

However, they said there were still a lot of people with outstanding arrears with whom they had not made arrangements.  My fear - and they seemed to indicate that there might be some basis for it - is that as we do deals with some people, we are likely to see a significant increase in repossessions for others.  That is because we are probably dealing with a cohort that will have much more difficulty in coming to arrangements.  How do things stand in that regard with Ulster Bank?</p>

We have put an enormous amount of resources into dealing with the issue, not just by talking to customers but also by putting solutions in place.  As a consequence of that we have seen our arrears decrease 19 months in a row, month on month, from the peak in March 2013.  We have seen more than 8,000 customers who were in arrears not being in arrears now.  That said, there is still a problem out there and we are still actively engaging with customers.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">About half of those have been engaging, so there are probably around 2,500 customers with whom we are still struggling to get meaningful engagement.  Just to reiterate our flexibility, if a customer makes a payment - even without engaging with us - we will adjourn the court hearing.  That is because we do not want to be perceived to be chasing a repossession if the customer is making some effort to make a payment or speak to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">  One figure does need to be borne in mind.  We did some work on our own portfolio and the average amount that mortgage arrears customers are paying in repayments on unsecured credit is typically twice the amount of the shortfall that exists between what they should be paying on their mortgage and what they are paying on their mortgage. </p>

          <p eId="para_280">Yes, the same customers.  The average customer in arrears would have between €11,000 and €12,000 of unsecured debt.  However, the nature of unsecured debt is that it is at a higher APR and over a shorter period, so the monthly payments can often be 60% or 70% of the mortgage payment, which is why we have been very supportive of debt relief notice and debt settlement arrangements through the personal insolvency service.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">  That is why we were happy to support the intra-bank arrangements that were made through the IBF whereby if one of the five principal banks is trying to settle a mortgage issue, but one of the other banks holds the unsecured debt, the other bank agrees to deprioritise the unsecured debt so that the focus could be made on the mortgage holder.</p>

Just before Deputy Boyd Barrett came into the room, we indicated to the Chairman that where a customer can show evidence that they are eligible for social housing, we would support them with a voluntary assisted sale and not chase the shortfall that may be left over after the property is sold.

          <p eId="para_299">We are not doing much on that.  We are doing a very small amount.  However, the issue for us is that we have had other commercial real estate issues to deal with as a result of the previous bubble, so we are very cautious at the moment about what we do in that space - so there is some, but it is very small.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">The joint committee is back in public session for an overview of the banking sector in Ireland and this meeting is open to the public.  I welcome to the meeting Mr. David Duffy, chief executive officer of Allied Irish Banks, AIB.  Mr. Duffy is accompanied by Mr. Mark Bourke, chief financial officer, Mr. Bernard Byrne, head of personal, business and corporate banking in the Republic of Ireland and Mr. Brendan O'Connor, head of the financial solutions group.  The format of the meeting will be that Mr. Duffy will make some opening remarks.  In advance of the meeting, we collated questions from members of the committee and submitted these to Allied Irish Banks.  I thank Mr. Duffy and his staff for responding in writing to them, particularly promptly I might add.  These responses have been distributed to members and together with the input of the witnesses today, I hope that all the key topics will have been covered.  Nonetheless, a question and answer session will follow the presentations to clarify any outstanding matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off because they interfere with the broadcasting of proceedings.  I note the joint committee also is joined by its secretariat, namely, Kieran Lenihan, Noeleen Kelly and Eoin Hartnett, and I thank them for their work in preparing the documentation for this overview of the Irish banking system.  This is the final session in this round of engagements regarding the banking system and I thank the secretariat for its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">  After Mr. Duffy has made his statement, the format of the meeting will be that the chief spokespersons initially will be given ten minutes, with five minutes for members and then five minutes for anyone else.  I will remind anybody present of this once Mr. Duffy has concluded his opening remarks.  Before Mr. Duffy commences and on behalf of the joint committee, I thank him for appearing before members today.  I now invite him to make his opening statement.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_256">
          <from> Mr. David Duffy<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_312">I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the joint committee for again giving AIB the time to provide the Oireachtas and the Irish public with a comprehensive update on the bank’s transition from recovery in previous years to growth, as well as an overview of our strategic priorities.  I will try to be brisk in my summary to allow as much time as possible for the questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">  As members are aware, AIB is a listed company on the Irish Stock Exchange and consequently, the comments we make today regarding the possible performance of the bank in particular should not be considered as forward guidance nor should they be considered a solicitation to buy shares in the bank.  As the Vice Chairman noted, we have submitted responses to the questions sent to the bank by the Oireachtas and have endeavoured to answer the questions as fully as possible within the confines of the disclosure requirements imposed by our listing rules.  We also have submitted a short presentation, which summarises the recent financial performance of the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">  Next month, it will have been three years since I joined the bank as chief executive and this is the fourth occasion since I took up the role that we have had the opportunity to meet the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  We find it to be a most valuable forum in which to explain our performance and, on this occasion, my team and I are presenting a picture that is in sharp and positive contrast to our first meeting with the joint committee back in October 2012.  At that meeting, we outlined a three-year strategic plan to restore our stability, achieve sustainable growth and return to profitability.  This involved fundamental and major organisational change, restructuring, deleveraging and the introduction of a much-reduced cost base.  We were obliged to restructure the balance sheet, overhaul our funding and lending profiles, rebuild credibility with the funding markets, meet restructuring targets and position the bank for prudent loan growth.  In 2012, we focused on restructuring the business across all elements of the bank, from the balance sheet size and structure to cost-reduction programmes.  In 2013, we focused the energy and direction of the bank on rebuilding our relationships with all our customers and on the external commercial agenda, while seeing improvements in the operating performance of the bank.  This year, in 2014, we have been in a position to focus on prudent lending growth and profitability while at the same time accelerating our progress on dealing with customers in arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">  We are happy to be here today to demonstrate the degree of the bank’s recovery and the benefit this will bring to our customers and to the wider Irish economy.  In summary, AIB is now a profitable business that is generating capital, has received European Union approval for our restructuring plan, has passed the European Central Bank, ECB, stress tests without the requirement for additional capital from the State, sees reducing arrears levels and overall levels of impaired loans and is well-positioned from a funding, capital and liquidity perspective to grow prudently the bank’s loan book over time and support economic recovery.  To be more specific, this year we returned to profit before tax with €437 million generated in the first half of 2014, which is a €1.3 billion improvement in performance over the first half of 2013.  To the end of September, total impaired loans reduced by circa €4.6 billion, which is a 16% drop since December 2013, with the total number of accounts in arrears in the Irish residential mortgage portfolio declining by 11% and arrears for owner-occupier mortgages down by 15%.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">  Members will be aware that at the end of last month, AIB passed the European-wide stress testing exercise conducted by the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the Central Bank of Ireland.  Under the comprehensive assessment, AIB’s capital buffers were comfortably above minimum requirements under all stress test assessment scenarios.  Passing the stress tests was an important event for AIB and the Irish economy.  It was not just confirmation of the bank’s current capital position but was an important external validation that the bank is equipped and capitalised to deal with future shocks should they arise.  On Monday last, 10 November, AIB’s interim management statement covering the quarter to 30 September 2014 showed a continuation of the company’s half-year results.  The statement indicated that the overall operating performance of AIB was ahead of expectations in the year to date.  The bank’s profitable trend was maintained, generating additional capital in the third quarter of the year.  A copy of this information has been sent to the joint committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">  Lending to customers is of course the true test of our financial health and is critical to our future growth and Ireland’s economic recovery.  While there is much conjecture as to the appetite for banks to lend in the economy, I want to be clear that AIB is seeking to increase its lending and has the ability to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Bearing in mind the lessons from the recent past, this does not mean that we will approve all applications but it does mean that we have the appetite to support viable lending opportunities at competitive lending rates which reflect the cost of operating our business, the risk associated with lending in a recovering economy and the need to generate a commercial return for shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> AIB approved lending of approximately €9 billion in the first nine months of 2014 and this is a 39% increase on the same period in the previous year. As such, AIB is on track to exceed its €7 billion to €10 billion lending approvals target for 2014. AIB has leading market shares in Ireland across our personal, small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, and corporate businesses. AIB is the No. 1 bank in Ireland for start-ups, it is the largest lender to the agri-sector and it has numerous active funds to support lending and economic recovery as part of our dedicated sector specialist approach to our customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> New lending drawdowns of approximately €4 billion in the first nine months of the year represented a 40% increase on the same period in 2013. These figures are reflective not only of the improving economic backdrop in our main markets of Ireland and the UK but also speak to the underlying ability of the bank to lend prudently to our customers. As AIB continues to return to more normalised operations, the leadership team and I are strongly of the view that this should benefit customers whilst striking a balance with ensuring the bank is operating commercially and generating a return for shareholders who are, ultimately, taxpayers. To this end, and as a result of the bank's underlying positive performance and funding cost reductions, AIB, EBS and Haven recently announced a number of reductions to variable and fixed interest rates for owner-occupier mortgages. The move benefits approximately 146,000 existing mortgage account holders. For example, customers with a €200,000 mortgage will save up to €334 per annum, based on a 25-year term.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> We remain very conscious of the need to bring debt resolution and certainty to our SME customers in difficulty. We are accelerating activity in this area and are meeting targets for restructuring. Facilitating SME customers to return to more manageable debt levels and moving onto a growth curve requires intensive one-to-one engagement but we are seeing tangible results and this is reflected in our financial results and in the reduction in the level of impaired loans on the bank's balance sheet. Likewise with mortgages in arrears, increased customer engagement is evident and the overall economic upturn means we are now seeing a reduction in mortgage arrears and in the overall levels of impaired loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> We have engaged in a project with the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, IMHO, that offers customers in difficulty an alternative avenue of dealing with the bank. The scheme, announced a year ago, allows customers in difficulty with their mortgage repayments to avail of the independent third party services of the IMHO to advise clients and engage with the bank on their behalf. The initiative is available free of charge to AIB Group customers, including those with EBS and Haven, who are experiencing residential mortgage difficulties. Solutions offered and concluded with our customers, whether through the IMHO or directly through our own arrears management unit, are fundamentally based on the principle of maximum affordability for the customer. Whether regarding SMEs or mortgages, the solutions we are agreeing with our customers in difficulty are based on a principle of maximum affordability and are being concluded on commercial terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> While the bank has made progress in recent years, we recognise that a number of challenges lie ahead and that overall personal and business debt levels and the number of impaired loans in the economy are still elevated. We will continue to focus on rebuilding the trust and confidence of our customers and improving our customer service levels. Additionally, as a commercial organisation we are focused on generating competitive returns for shareholders over time. It is a core principle of the bank to treat all of our customers, including those in arrears, on an equitable and fair basis, regardless of their circumstances and their position in society. This principle is vital to the long-term sustainability of AIB.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> In summary, on behalf of the bank, I want to again express thanks to the Chairman and committee members for inviting us here today. We have implemented changes to our approach based on previous Oireachtas sessions and I genuinely view this as an invaluable element of shaping the bank's thinking and strategy. Members will appreciate that, as a public company with a commercial mandate, we have to balance the requirement of generating value for our shareholders, principally Irish taxpayers, with the requirements of our customers who also support the bank. Meanwhile, I reiterate that everyone in the bank, including the board, the leadership team, our workforce and myself, will continue to seek to prudently grow the business commercially for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and the wider economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">I thank Mr. Duffy and his colleagues for all the detailed information sent in advance as it is very comprehensive and such information allows us prepare properly for sessions like this.  In terms of measurement of the bank's performance, there has been a marked improvement but I am not here to pat the witnesses on the back.  We are here to ask hard questions and I am sure they understand this.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">  I first want to address the ownership and capital structure of the bank.  There has been much speculation that the Government will seek to sell a stake in AIB in the market at some point in 2015.  I think the State's priority should be to recoup as much as possible of the money it invested in AIB.  It amounts to almost €21 billion and, preferably, it should all be recouped.  How can the State best achieve this objective?  When will AIB start paying dividends to shareholders?  Have shareholders been consulted on the future ownership of the bank and the possible sale of a stake?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_259">
          <from> Mr. David Duffy<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_328">I shall address those points in turn.  As chief executive, I believe AIB will return the full amount that the State invested.  This will take time but we expect to do so.  Regarding the sale of a stake in AIB and the timing thereof, we have stated consistently that we must deliver a three-year recovery that ends in 2014.  The aim has always been to be able to say by the end of 2014 that AIB is a profitable, well capitalised bank without concerns regarding State funding.  We passed the European Commission tests, delivered on the associated targets and are a functioning lender in the economy - all of the elements one expects from a functioning bank.  On delivery of our full year's results for 2014 we will be able to say AIB is investable and this is the first and most critical hurdle on entering a sale process.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">  We engage with investors from an education perspective, rather than a sale perspective, to keep them abreast of the performance of the bank and the economy in concert.  We are engaged with the Department in a discussion about two things.  First, we must understand the capital structure and how it can be addressed.  Second, we must discuss the capital requirement with the European regulator and the domestic regulator.  Until these two matters are entirely clear it is impossible to come up with a defined series of actions around them.  We expect that during December 2014 there will be further clarity on this capital from the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, and the Central Bank.  Once we have clarity we can decide how to treat prefs, cocos and any issuance in the market.  Only when such matters are clear, in terms of the balance sheet, will investors be willing to invest.  AIB will not determine the exact timing of an investment as the shareholder unit of the Department of Finance will make that decision to obtain maximum value and inform us of same.  Our obligation is to be ready upon receipt of instructions from the shareholder unit to execute the mandate.  We will be ready as of the first quarter of 2015.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">I take it, then, that the bank is in discussion with the Department of Finance about the capital structure of AIB and it is expected there will be an exercise to tidy the capital structure.  I presume this is what Mr. Duffy means when he refers to the capital requirement and how the newly shaped bank might look in terms of capital structure.  The discussions are under way.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">That is correct.  We must determine European capital guidance and then enter a discussion on what the capital should be.  After this one can begin to manage components, which is a prerequisite for sale.  This is exactly what is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">Yes.  To distil it all down, our mission in life, other than having a functioning bank, is to return the entire value back to the taxpayer of the funds invested.  The only way we can do that is by making the bank attractive to investors.  Therefore, we must engineer all of our performance to create a profitable and investable bank which also has a clear capital structure.  Hence, capital is the main priority for reconstruction.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">The way we look at it is that there is a market and also an internal objective in terms of the Government monetising value.  We must balance the two of these all the time.  The most appropriate way to proceed is to make sure we obtain the maximum price and do a number of sales rather than one big bang.  We have our advisers and the Department of Finance has its advisers and we try to engage the best knowledge and market understanding from all of those parties, including estimating values if one sells over a period of time.  This is all under the umbrella of maximising the return and getting the full amount back.  There is no way that one can predict entirely in advance what is right, but there is a logic to selling pieces of the bank over a period of time.  I have yet to determine,  with the Department of Finance, whether or not that will be the plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">It is a matter of timing.  There is a value in the bank in the market at any one point in time.  If one looks at that value and sells some of it and there are dividend periods, then depending on the market valuation, the dividends will take more or less time to reconcile to the total.  If we are of the view today that there is a value of somewhere around €10 billion in the bank, depending on contingent convertible capital instruments, cocos, and so on, we can say that half the value is evident today and we would then look at dividends reconciled and remainder.  It is a mathematical equation.  Our job is to ensure we maximise the value on sale of the bank at any point in time.  Thereafter, it is a function of calculating the timing on dividends to reconcile the answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">The fair way to answer is to point out where we have come from in the past three years.  We have increased the value of the bank significantly; depending on the market opinion, it is now valued at €10 billion or thereabouts.  If we could create that increase in value in the past three years, we can expect to do the same in the coming years.  There will be further increases in value of the franchise and dividends in the future.  I hope it will be achievable within ten years.  As we have all seen, the markets in the past ten years have had different events.  One cannot predict markets on a ten-year forward basis.  However, as a reasonable person, I would expect to try to achieve that goal.</p>

          <p eId="para_352">I very much welcome the announcement of a reduction in the standard variable interest rate.  This is a significant move by AIB and makes it a market leader in this regard.  I hope it will trigger a round of further cuts by other banks.  Does AIB management intend to put some money behind that move in terms of marketing to customers of other banks?   Will it try to entice people who have their mortgage with Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank or Permanent TSB and who are paying a higher interest rate compared with what AIB is now charging?</p>

          <p eId="para_353">We are advertising our products nationally as any competitive franchise would.  That takes into account any customer of other banks.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments regarding our decision to reduce our standard variable rate.  It is important to note, however, that this was one action of a series.  We have also put in place a fixed-rate offering, which is very significant but perhaps less well understood in the general environment.  The rate for a one-year fixed-rate mortgage is 3.5% and since we introduced it, 40% of all mortgages issued by AIB are at 3.5%.  The customer must make the decision in this regard and we cannot dictate.  Our objective is to offer broadly competitive rates as cost effectively as we can while bringing in a shareholder return and to do so in a flexible manner.  The reality we are looking at today is that although we have reduced the variable rate, we are in a position that 40% of all customers are taking the 3.5% one-year fixed rate.  I see that as a very positive development.</p>

I am the good cop, obviously.  I congratulate the delegates on the huge improvement in AIB's position.  When one considers what the situation was when they first appeared before the committee, the progress is astounding.  I have every confidence that the bank will make a full return to the taxpayer in due course.  I acknowledge Mr. Duffy's point that it cannot be timed exactly.  AIB had a very successful half year and I have no doubt that will continue.  I wish the delegates well in their continuing efforts.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">Senator Coghlan seems to be saying I am a bad cop.  I welcome Mr. Duffy and his colleagues.  The big issue in the media in regard to AIB is the question of getting back taxpayers' €21 billion.  It is difficult to lose sight of the sheer magnitude of that sum.  To give it some context, the budget of the Department of Education and Skills is €8 billion while that of the Department of Justice and Equality is €4 billion or so.  It is an incredible sum which, if it were available to the Exchequer, could be used to great benefit for ordinary people.  The board of directors must have discussed the approach it would like to pursue to get that money back.  Has consideration been given to appointing investment advisers or anything like that in anticipation of going to the market?  I would like to hear where the board stands on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">The board discussion is a macro, high-level one which talks about, first, meeting our European Commission objectives.  That has been the substance of the conversation to date.  That takes us to half-time in the match, so to speak.  The second half is to do with the question of how we can remain sustainable and competitive and generate value in the future.  There have been intensive discussions around how we position ourselves.  We have reduced our head count from a high of 25,000 to in and around 11,000, while costs have been reduced by €350 million in the past three years.  That has been the nature of the discussion.  With regard to the sale, the discussion has been about those two elements creating a valuation at the maximum potential for the shareholder.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">We need a proper banking system.  No one denies that.  I welcome the fact that the witnesses have brought the bank back to profitability, but the balance is our getting a return on our money.  The bank is worth half its peak value, although peak values were out of control at every level.  Like any institution, the bank probably has projections for the next five years.  How does AIB project that it will perform and how will its market valuation progress over that period?  The witnesses referred to capital structures and the European Investment Bank, EIB.  The third element is how AIB will do in future.  It is a question of timing.  Clearly, the bank does not want the taxpayer getting less of a return on the investment in two or three years' time were the bank allowed to proceed to trade.  Mr. Duffy is in the hot seat and has access to information within the bank.  Where will AIB go in the next five years?</p>

The economy's recovery is in its early stages and we still carry a large number of non-performing loans.  We have articulated our view to the board that we should see a further 12 months of the full execution of the plan in trends every quarter before beginning to estimate the value.  We look to the best-in-class performance and what our peers are doing across Europe and are setting our targets accordingly.  We ask whether we can compete in the top quartile and try to do that.  We consider our arrears, provisions and all of the other elements of the balance sheet and try to form a view of what we believe the value will be.  It has not been determined yet.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">Regarding mortgage interest, I will ask a positive question with a negative twist.  Why did AIB reduce its variable rate?  Permanent TSB was the last bank to present to us.  Of it, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, none has dropped its rate.  Bank of Ireland has a net interest margin of 2.08%.  Ulster Bank has a net interest margin of 2.32%.  Permanent TSB's margin is low at 0.88%.  AIB's figure is 1.6%.  Mr. Brown of Ulster Bank told the committee this morning of his belief that banks should be trying to achieve something in the order of 2.5%.  My question is leading, but I am giving a context.  I welcome AIB's reduction and reasonable net interest margin, but the reduction could have an impact on the margin.  Why did it do this?</p>

          <p eId="para_376">That is a fair question.  We did it for two reasons.  First, we have set out time and again at this meeting our principles of treating customers fairly and on an equitable basis.  We have worked hard to run a structured rebuilding of the bank, including by improving our margin and managing downwards our cost of funding.  If we could make improvements in our funding levels, we felt it appropriate within those principles to return some share to the customer.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">It is a mix in terms of how we have improved funding across the board.  Second, we did not make the decision without having regard to the margin.  We have forecast, on a guidance level, being in excess of 2% over time.  With a view to achieving that margin, managing our funding and using our publicly stated principles, we asked whether we could do this.  The answer was, "Yes".</p>

          <p eId="para_379">For me it is straightforward.  Given the reduction, AIB anticipates that its cost of funding will decrease and expects variable rates to fall rather than rise.  Am I correct in my assumption?</p>

          <p eId="para_380">We anticipate that our cost of funding may improve, but decisions are not just based on that element.  There is also the cost of risk and the cost of managing the bank.  All three elements form part of the equation.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">Based on those elements, the other main banks that presented to us, particularly Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, should be dropping their rates in line with AIB's.  Ulster Bank and Bank of Ireland have higher net margins.  As I have stated previously, there is a lack of competition in the Republic of Ireland market.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">  The variable rate that AIB charges in the North is more or less the same as its standard rate.  Where loan-to-value, LTV, ratios fall below 60%, however, the variable rate charged is significantly less than it is in the Republic.  This is the one consistent trend across the banks.  Why is this the case for AIB?  It seems simple - there is competition in the market in the North.  It seems clear from our meetings with the banks that there is more than a possibility that they are exploiting and ripping Irish customers off, given the fact that the average cost of borrowing for mortgages across Europe is significantly less.  There is an onus on the banks and the Governor of the Central Bank to deal with this issue now and ensure proper competition in the market.  Will Mr. Duffy answer my question on the Republic versus the North?</p>

          <p eId="para_387">No.  People have decided to compete on that particular rate for that particular offering in that particular marketplace.  If one examines the quantums associated with the offering, one will not find a great deal of activity.  It is an attractive headline rate for discussion, but it is not where the market is.  The standard variable rates across that marketplace are, on average, at or higher than those in this marketplace.  Weighting provides more representative information.  There is a teaser rate on which people compete heavily, but it is that.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">The bank has been meeting investors for quite a number of years to get the bank ready for sale in the first quarter of next year if it is sanctioned.  Is Mr. Duffy surprised that the Minister for Finance is telling the committee he will apply for retroactive recapitalisation for the bank?  If this were the case, it would be a transfer of the shareholding the State holds to the European Stability Mechanism.  Is Mr. Duffy surprised these discussions have not taken place?  I am actually not surprised, because I do not believe the Minister will do it.  I would be surprised if the Minister were intending to do so, and telling us he will make an application and it is a matter of timing, but not speaking to the CEO of the bank who is speaking to investors.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">It is a good observation on one level, but to be honest the practical nature of this means regardless of whether any transaction such as this happens it would be but an interim stepping stone.  The single supervisory mechanism would not be a long-term holder of the shares so we would still need to look to the investors.  Educating the investors is required whatever sequence is arrived at.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">I agree with Mr. Duffy that it will be the final outcome.  Does he accept, as the CEO of AIB, that to have the State transfer the shares from the ESM out of the State's hands could pose major challenges for the bank in how it is structured and operates?  If it were the intention of the Government, would he expect discussions to be under way at this stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_416">I do not think it would have a change impact on the bank regardless of it being the outcome.  The European restructuring plan involves the same group of people who effectively approved our strategy, and being a shareholder would not see a change in the strategy or, therefore, any structural element of the bank.  If a conversation were imminent and I was about to hear of it on leaving the meeting, I would be surprised if I had not already heard it.</p>

The number of people earning more than €100,000 has reduced by 40% during my tenure over the past three years.  Significantly, while we or the Deputy may have an opinion on this, I have managed to lose in excess of 20 very senior people who are being paid significantly more, in Ireland, by competitors and in other industries.  If I must run a commercial enterprise to get the €20 billion back, I must be able to focus on managing it commercially.  In such cases I may need talent levels which cost this much.

In 50 of those cases, we voted for the proposal and in seven we voted against the proposal.  In all but two of those we voted against, we had already offered the customer a modification - a substantial fundamental restructure on the primary mortgage.  Principally, this was because we did not believe the structure made sense either for the borrower or ourselves.  In 50 out of 57 cases, we voted "Yes".  We only exercise our veto if we believe the deal is wrong.  Typically, that is because there is too much of a dividend going out to unsecured debt.  Where we do not control a vote, we voted "Yes" in 34 out of 45 cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">The nature of anything we do is on-shore.  Before all of this technology cycle hit, we undertook to have an external party do an independent and robust review of the resilience of our payment systems, which is of particular sensitivity.  We are also taking and have taken decisions at our board on the level investment in this area, to ensure we have the resilience required for the our operating model.  As the largest payments provider in the country, we take this responsibility seriously.  It is not necessarily a correlation to say outsourcing happens with technology and, therefore, there is a lack of resilience in payment systems.  We will deliver resilience in our payment system.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">One of the criteria is the economic criteria, based on populations moving and changing.  As usage changes, if a bank is to remain open, it must be an economic proposition.  We have tried to change the functionality of each branch to make it more cost effective and so we can operate a branch environment at a lower cost, which makes it more likely the branch will survive in the longer term.  The cheaper cost of operation allows us to maintain the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">  Generally, the decision on whether a branch is to close is driven by the economics of how transactions take place.  Nowadays, some 95% of all transactions take place away from the branch.  We are focused on keeping the branch useful as a service and customer engagement environment.  However, some 95% of people's transactions do not happen in the branch.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">That is difficult to answer because there are many different elements of IT service.  The device a person has is not our device, but we may put apps on the device.  We also have infrastructure, main frames and desktop technology.  Some elements, by definition, are critical, such as payment related systems.  Other elements, such as desktops or app developments, are not.  Therefore, the answer is both "Yes" and "No", depending on the area.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">Yes.  Some of the logic behind that is that there are two elements to it.  One relates to what would happen the market if that was implemented.  Currently, there are many more buyers than there are homes available.  As a result, I do not believe some of the dramatic statements on the market are relevant, as the houses will still be purchased.  Second, the principle of a 20% deposit and the loan to income, LTI, rate are valid.  I am on public record as saying I agree with those.  If we take a long-term view of the customer's protection as well as of our bank stability, we should look at those kinds of levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The real issue is one of execution, which involves some element of transition in order that the law of unintended consequences does not drive out a sector of the economy.

          <p eId="para_472">If one wants to obtain the full €20 billion return, one must hire the best talent and the market will dictate the pay level.  Many of us have taken our jobs at the pay cap.  I have reduced my compensation to 15% below the pay cap and retained it at that level.  This is a market force issue.  It has taken me a very long time, nearly two years, to hire a chief financial officer.  One will not get the value back to the State unless one can attract a chief financial officer of a certain calibre who can bring the bank to the market.  It took me two years, not to convince Mr. Bourke but to get him into the bank.  These are realistic elements we must deal with and, therefore, the compensation issue, while still the subject of the cap, is not my main focus.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I welcome our visitors.  Questions Nos. 19 and 22 have not been answered.  I ask the witnesses to answer them in correspondence.  Question No. 22 asked what percentage of AIB customers pay at the highest rate of interest.  The response directs us to Question No. 19, which is a different question and the response does not answer Question No. 22.  I ask AIB to send a reply to the committee secretariat.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">  On the proposals made by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, Mr. Duffy's remarks are much more informative than the replies provided to Questions Nos. 25 and 40 in the written document.  Given that the proposals were published on 7 October last, Allied Irish Banks must have formed a more definitive view than the views expressed in the answers to these questions.  I gather the bank's view is that while the proposals are a good idea, they should not be implemented at this time.  That is not, however, the view provided in the written reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">  The Nyborg report estimates that if the rules proposed by the Central Bank had been in place, we would have been required to put €2 billion rather than €64 billion into Irish banks.  I would have expected a stronger endorsement of the proposed rules than that provided in the written document submitted to the joint committee.  These rules are a normal part of banking in other countries where busts do not occur.  Is that not the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_478">Yes.  Perhaps that is my mistake in terms of the documentation.  I stated immediately after the rules were issued - this was reported on the front page of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> - and subsequently at a conference that I was absolutely supportive of the proposed rules.  I would like to make clear that I do not have any equivocation about the principles.  I am old enough to remember being subject to these types of limits when I was young and looking for a mortgage.  If one looks at long-term stability, these are the types of principles we should have and they should be inherent in every economy.  Not unlike anything else I am trying to do, this is a matter of execution.  When one seeks to introduce a significant change of policy at a particular point in time it always creates unintended consequences.  It is taking us some time to try to map out these consequences in order that we can give an informed and constructive view to the Central Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">  In the reports compiled on behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts and Comptroller and Auditor General, Professor Honohan was especially concerned that accountants in the previous era did not have an accurate view of what was occurring in the banks.

What has been the bank's experience of making this change and how has it contributed to the overall improvement in AIB's operation which Mr. Duffy recounted?</p>

          <p eId="para_483">That is a fair point on which my colleagues may also comment.  The issue must be viewed through the lens of risk because risk is the business we are in.  While accountants have a view of that risk, they are looking at the core issue.  We took the view that a fresh forensic view from the accountants was important.  The other vital element was to ensure the risk governance of the bank was robust and independent.  This means not getting into the problem for somebody else to be able to see it.  We have, therefore, brought in a chief risk officer who does not report to me.  This means that I, as the chief executive officer, cannot enforce a lending practice or deal.  The chief risk officer reports to the head of risk who is a board member and the committee of risk is a sub-committee of the board.  What we have is a governance model alongside a risk appetite that is defined and agreed at the board level rather than the executive level.  What one can do in each bucket and the independence of the risk head are the two vital criteria for risk management.  One adds to this the forensic lens of the external accountants.  The combined effect of these factors will ensure the types of issues to which the Senator refers will not recur in AIB.</p>

What are its expansion plans in terms of opening new branches?  What is the value of the company as a result of realising and writing down losses?  How does its make-up play into the value of what is essentially a State owned asset?

The IMHO released results last week showing that long-term sustainable solutions had been reached for approximately 1,350 accounts.  There is some misunderstanding about the nature of the relationship between Allied Irish Banks and the Irish Mortgage Holders Association.  The IMHO is an engagement channel and the services we offer through that channel are not any different from the services we offer through any other channel.  To the extent that personal insolvency practitioners come to us or a mortgage holder contacts us directly, we do not offer a special product.  What we provide is an engagement that is principally for people who want to be represented and believe they cannot approach the bank directly.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">It gets probably better results on intractable cases.  I refer to people who are scared and who, for whatever reason, have not wanted to face the bank.  We have managed to cure some very deep arrears cases.  In the year to date, we have cured approximately 2,000 cases that have been in arrears greater than a year, and some that have been in arrears of two or three years.  It has proven very good with intractable cases.  They give them a lot of one-to-one attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">  We expanded the service this year.  It is a pure cost-recovery model.  I will not get into the economics of it, but it is pure cost recovery.  To the extent that the IMHO is a dedicated channel for AIB, EBS or Haven, they get a cost recovery, and we agree that at the start of the year.  We did expand it to put additional people in.  We are happy, as we stated at the committee last year, to the extent that it has more people coming through that channel.  I would love to expand the capacity.  If it achieves solutions, it is great.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">Is there any vehicle other than the IMHO out there?  The reason I ask is that we are trying to get a platform that we can spread across the other institutions in order to help those with distressed loans.

          <p eId="para_499">There is nothing else out there that is anything like it.  It has a specific purpose.  We put a fairly good methodology around it.  I could not speak for what other banks would choose to do or not to do, but I believe it is as good and valid a model as is out there.  Third-party representation, for those who feel they need it, clearly works.  We are also agnostic as to advisers.  In a lot of cases, an adviser is helpful for those who feel they cannot deal with what is happening.  I would love to see it expand.  I would love to see more advisory services in the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">We have a long-standing relationship with An Post anyway.  As we were closing down branches in a number of rural locations, we expanded that relationship to include significant functionality in post offices around those locations in order to take the transactions.  Last year we conducted over €1 billion of transactions through An Post, which was approximately a 7% increase year-on-year.  This equates to 3.25 million transactions.  The largest single piece consisted of SME paper transactions, which very small businesses find useful for lodging cheques and cash.  That is where the offering is.  We have continued to expand it; for example, there is now a slightly more enhanced credit card capability.  We will do that because it is useful and helpful from both parties' point of view.  Every now and then, we are competitors of An Post as well.  We both compete for business such as deposits and other offerings.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">We have to get the right balance in respect of these matters, and that is what we seek to do.  An Post understands that.  It is a matter of trying to come up with the right balance for us, for the customer and for An Post.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">  In respect of enhancements in the future, that is one of the issues we have been focused on.  We have gone through the retraction of some of the physical infrastructure.  We have invested heavily in opening more channels.  We are available much more now than we used to be.  We have 15 lobbies that are available for 14 hours a day.  That used not to exist.  Small businesses can use those lobbies in high-footfall locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">  We have an online channel, in terms of phone banking, for customers from 8 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock at night six days a week.  That is a really enhanced offering, particularly in rural locations.  In particular, those involved in agriculture find that helpful, as they do not have to go into the branch any more; they can get loans online.  We are trying to enhance that functionality.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">I will make a point to Mr. Byrne about first-time buyers and those who are going back in to try to secure family homes.  There is a power-distance relationship that has evolved as a result of the crisis.  When customers go to a bank, the relationship element is not as strong as it used to be.  I note some customers have stated that they are looking at identifying a person in the bank who will help them navigate through the process.  It is not appropriate for customers who are neither economists nor bankers, nor experienced in purchasing loans for mortgages, to have a telecommunications relationship rather than an individual relationship in which they can ask questions and sit down with staff.  Where is AIB in this regard and what is it doing to ensure that customers are being prudent and provided with the correct advice?</p>

          <p eId="para_508">On the mortgage side, our most recent campaigns in respect of both brands, AIB and EBS, have featured this as a significant component.  In AIB, our commitment is that the same person who handles a customer's mortgage application will be with the person all the way through the process.  That is our advertising positioning.  In EBS, there is a commitment to personalisation and out-of-hours availability - that is, much more significant hours, because it is a different model.</p>

          <p eId="para_517">The reason I am asking the question about the balance sheet is that some institutions are realising their losses and writing down debts, and this has an implication for the balance sheet.  In the event that AIB is not realising and crystallising losses, what kinds of latent or deferred loss are built into balance sheets within the bank at present, and how does AIB sell this when conducting its whistle-stop tour to corporate investors and others who are considering investing in AIB?  I am really asking how it all stacks up.</p>

          <p eId="para_518">We are talking about the fact that AIB currently has an inordinately large non-performing loan portfolio of approximately €26 billion, and today we have approximately €13 billion of provisions against that.  That is down substantially, even from our June results.  Our experience to date has been, as one will see in the June results, that we restructured approximately €3.2 billion and we wrote off against that €1.9 billion of provisions.  In doing so, we were able to write back approximately €200 million.  That is the result of the first six months, which tells us that we are operating comfortably within provisions to that extent, as we work through our non-performing loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_525">I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the answers they have given both in writing and orally.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">  I will start by echoing Senator Barrett's view on the Central Bank's new mortgage deposit and loan-to-earnings ratios, how crucial these standards are, how they can insulate us against future boom-bust cycles, and the need for the banks - not only AIB but those right across the sector - to get behind that.  Some of the response to date has been most disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">  I commend AIB on the work that is ongoing with the IMHO.  It is really constructive and it is working well.  Where my concern lies is with the significant amount of impaired SME loans that are still on AIB's books.  I am sure it has already been mentioned, but, as I understand it from the answers AIB has given, €4.4 billion is the current amount of impaired loans on its books.  I welcome the fact that this has decreased by 9% since December 2013, but I wonder whether any thought is being given to an IMHO-style solution whereby business owners can have some form of independent representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">  Obviously, one of the biggest drags on the economy is this overhang of debt for business.  The growth in the economy that we have seen to date is largely led by exports and foreign direct investment, not by the indigenous economy.  There is a real need, and an interest, for banks to do something about that.  Even with the new legislation, the examinership process is not working for SMEs. It is too expensive.  AIB has an opportunity to lead in trying to find a solution to assist SMEs in a meaningful way, and I would be interested in hearing Mr. Duffy's views on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_530">I wish to point out at the outset, with regard to examinership, that the vast bulk of SME debt in the country is drawn in personal names rather than in corporate entities, so for many people examinership is, unfortunately, not an option.  If one takes out the consumer mortgages, we deal with approximately €20 billion worth of challenged debt, most of which is impaired, while some is not.  The figures referred to by Mr. Bourke earlier relate to a reduction of approximately €4.5 billion in that impaired debt over the past nine months.  That €4.5 billion has come about through restructurings with customers and recognising that some of the debt will not be recoverable, so write-downs are in place.  As of the end of September, we have made offers in respect of approximately €16 billion of that €20 billion worth of debt, so we have issued heads of terms to these customers, 80% to 85% of which are accepted.  We will more than likely end up in a legal resolution with the rest.  There is quite a strong advisory core out there, but one is largely dealing with non-core debt, so it does not lend itself to examinership.  It also has a very entangled nature between personal property and buy-to-let and is sometimes wrapped up in pension mortgages and SMEs.  We would expect that by the end of next year we will have not only offered everybody a resolution but, ultimately, restructured, documented, fulfilled and drawn down those restructures in large part.  We have made a very significant amount of progress in the past nine months and now that activity is manifesting itself as the reduction in non-performing loans that one sees on the balance sheet today.  They are restructured drawn deals under which, subject to performance, customers will be able to get on with the rest of their lives and start their businesses or do whatever they need to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">It would be an exponentially more complex proposition because of the nature of the debt.  One of the reasons the IMHO works so successfully is that it is singularly focused on family home mortgages - that is, one asset.  It would be very difficult in the other area.  We are not against it, but it would be a huge investment by somebody and we would probably be finished by the time we got it done.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">The totality started at €29 billion, with €17 billion in provisions.  As Mr. O'Connor noted, we reduced that by €3.8 billion at the half year and wrote off €1.9 billion of those provisions.  The important thing to note is that in doing so, we are talking about the work that is being done and individual restructurings showing that we are over-provided in that particular case.  The summary for the half year was that we wrote back a level of those provisions.  What we would not do is extrapolate that and say there is an over-provision level or an amount that will come back.  What we would say today is that by the time we work through another large tranche - we are planning to deal with between €10 billion and €13 billion in a two-year period - we would have time-----</p>

That means getting to profitability in a sustainable way, with a passed stress test, approval from the European Commission, functional lending capacity showing that the largest lender in the economy is performing its role, arrears being addressed materially and non-performing loans being reduced.  That is the story.  We have been educating investors, not to sell the bank but to ascertain whether the team is delivering what it needs to deliver for the bank to be investable.  These discussions will continue.  We are now in a position where we hope to be able to say in March that the half-year result has continued in terms of its momentum and that the bank is now profitable, well capitalised and meeting the criteria with regard to lending and arrears, etc.  We want to be able to say at that point that the bank is investable.  Decisions on when to sell, at what price to sell and how much to sell are entirely in the hands of the shareholders.  That is what happens.  We have to fix the capital architecture before we can sell the bank.  We do not yet know what the capital solutions are.

          <p eId="para_584">I noted the comments made about the Governor of the Central Bank's statement on mortgage deposits and loan to earnings ratios.  We have mainly received reasonably negative comments about it from some of the other lending institutions.  Representatives of Ulster Bank said to us this morning that 68% of the first-time buyer mortgages approved by the bank this year would have fallen outside the proposed loan to value ratios or loan to income criteria.  They suggested, as their counterparts from Permanent TSB did, that a focus on affordability and repayment capacity would be more relevant than a focus on strict limits and criteria.  My personal belief is these criteria have no real or theoretical basis and that they hark back to the lending of the 1970s and 1980s, as opposed to more modern day lending.  Much of what has been suggested by the Governor of the Central Bank is an attempt to pre-empt another bubble in the property market.  Do the delegates believe we are in or are approaching a property bubble?</p>

          <p eId="para_585">From our perspective, this is not an actual credit boom but a stock and supply issue.  Therefore, we are not likely to be in that circumstance.  The perception we are discussing is being driven by a small number of properties in a small sector of this city.  There is no doubt that price anomalies will arise as a result of the stock issue.  That needs to be addressed.  If we look around the country more broadly, we will see that nobody in west Cork is having a Ballsbridge experience.  There has to be balance in that regard.  We map every single part of the geography in terms of incremental prices and stock, at which we look, as we look at our property strategy.  We believe that, with sensible lending and stock coming on stream and taking a five or ten year view of the economy, we will not see a property bubble.  We will see some volatility around the stock shortage and then stabilisation.</p>

          <p eId="para_590">An insurance scheme has an obvious appeal in satisfying many of the prudential requirements at which people are looking.  It also has an appeal from a consumer protection point of view.  Three elements need to be borne in mind on the other side.  First, such arrangements generally operate in a repossessions market in which there is very quick execution between somebody defaulting and a house repossession and a realisation of a loss taking place.  Therefore, the insurer is able to understand what the loss is and provide insurance.  It is less structured and less used to a market like the Irish market, in which a solution is worked through over a long period of time, in effect, in the absence of a loss event.  It is not that it could not happen, but it is certainly not designed in that way.  Second, there is a price to it and that price factors in the risk involved.  Rather than getting rid of the risk, one is simply moving the point of risk.  Third, under the current construct, these arrangements generally tend in effect to have a go-back-to-borrower clause.  The insurer might pay up, but it will seek recovery from the borrower.  </p>
          <p eId="para_591">  I suggest these three thoughts should be specifically borne in mind.  Someone should examine how any such arrangement would work in the Irish market.  Many markets end up with some government arrangement as part of the mix.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">Having practised as a solicitor for a number of years, I am very conscious of how the mortgage market has changed.  It changed from circumstances in which one had to save one's First Holy Communion money with a building society for approximately 40 years before one became eligible to apply for a loan, only to be turned down, to circumstances in which money was being thrown at people.  My concern is that we may overstep the mark and put people, particularly those not in permanent employment and those who work for themselves, in circumstances where they will never be able to own their own homes.  I am concerned about how the mortgage market is playing out.  What can we do to avoid returning to circumstances where people are permanently deprived of the possibility of owning their own home?</p>

          <from> Mr. David Duffy<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_593">Those are all fair observations.  Our view is that there are many examples of what we have been through and the many solutions that have been applied.   Each market is different and we should learn as much as possible.  In any submission we take this into account.  In a country this small and with such a proper drive waiting in its economy we must have a conservative approach to long-term stability.  That said, there should not be a law of unintended consequences.  One is dealing with a policy which, in principle, is absolutely fine.  The question is whether the numbers are fixed and can never change.  The real question concerns how to execute that change and prevent any single class from being disintermediated for 40 years, as the Deputy suggested.  How does one effect the transition?  We will come up with some response in the consultation along the lines of establishing a point of real policy and principle that could be applied to the circumstances and varied accordingly.  This should be kept under review, which is what we would do in the case of anything else.  Perhaps we might have a meeting of minds on the best way to apply the principles in transition.  It may never get to 20; it may stay at 15, or it may get to 17; I do not know.  We hope there is a rational execution model that ensures nobody is shut out of the market, while at the same time observing long-term stability in the marketplace.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">This is a subject to which we will definitely return.  The home ownership rate in Ireland has dropped by over 10%.  We have moved from having one of the highest rates in Europe to one of the lowest.  Not many people realise this.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">  My second issue, on which I do not want to hog too much time, relates to buy-to-let arrears and particularly the issue of the appointment of rent receivers.  It can be very problematic for many tenants when rent receivers are appointed to properties.  Some of the behaviour of rent receivers is appalling.  The committee's document on mortgage arrears and a more recent report from the Private Residential Tenancies Board by DKM Economic Consultants, RedC Research and Marketing and Ronan Daly Jermyn Solicitors have suggested the legislation be amended to clarify the role of receivers in their stepping into the shoes of landlords.  This is to avoid scenarios where rents are being paid but where basic repairs are not being carried out, for example, or where there are legal evictions of tenants because some lenders in the current market — I am not suggesting which ones — want properties back quickly without giving appropriate notice to the tenants.  Are the delegates against, in principle, the idea of changing the law to ensure clarity on this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_596">Absolutely not.  We use very reputable receivers.  We have a very strict governance process and receive frequent reports.  I am happy that our receivers behave in line with their statutory duties.  To the extent that these statutory duties are revised, etc., we are happy to offer support.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">It would be good to have clarity on that issue.  The buy-to-let loan books of Allied Irish Banks and every other institution show the number of cases in which there are serious arrears and which involve court proceedings.  There will be a lot of disruption in the market in the near future.  There is at present, but it will get worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">  Deputy Kieran O'Donnell asked a very interesting question to which we did not really receive a full reply.  Given what has happened, Allied Irish Banks has dropped its variable rate, but other lenders have not.  Deputy Kieran O'Donnell's point which was based on the figures and statistics to which he alluded and which he made cogently was that there was not enough competition in the market.  Does Mr. Duffy believe that is a fair comment?</p>

          <from> Mr. David Duffy<recordedTime time="2014-11-13T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_599">If he is saying there is not enough competition and that this is causing the rate debate, I am not sure he is entirely correct.  We are very supportive of more competition in the market.  The debate has become confused because people believe we have exorbitant margins.  I have pointed out that the ECB rate is not the reference point; it is 3% of our deposits; therefore, we are making thin margins, while trying to guarantee a shareholder return, even at the point to which we have reduced the current rates.  If one starts out with a premise that one is not profiteering, one has a very different funding rate from the rest of Europe.  Recovering bad credit with a view to trying to borrow on the market and lend is our reality, for which there is no benchmark in the rest of Europe.  Therefore, I am not sure the competition issue will change everything that much.  For the long-term health of the economy, there will be a need for more competition.  This will come from non-bank providers.  Some 80% of SME lending in Ireland is with banks, but some 80% of SME lending in America is with non-banks.  Therefore, the dynamic of the model will change.  Internet lending providers will enter the market in force and scale and this will result in a different form of competition.  It is not always just about another bank in a geographical location.  The competition will come over time.  Ulster Bank is staying, as has been made public, and one will see Permanent TSB drive recovery with strength; one will also see Internet providers.  Banks such as RaboDirect are offering a direct channel.  All of this will normalise over a period.</p>

          <p eId="para_600">I was very interested in Mr. Duffy's comments on the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, IMHO, which does superb work.  It is a model I would like to see rolled out across the entire banking sector and paid for by it.  It would benefit the banks considering that all of us engage with distressed borrowers and distressed lenders such as Allied Irish Banks regularly.  There is no doubt but that the opportunity for people to go to an independent expert to take them through the process is very helpful.  Does the IMHO deal with the buy-to-let market?  The delegates mentioned residential borrowers.  What about a buy-to-let borrower whose loan is not connected to a principal dwelling?  Is the service applicable in this case?</p>

          <p eId="para_601">Yes.  The IMHO can deal with buy-to-let mortgages if there is one buy-to-let property.  Effectively, where there is a consumer with a buy-to-let property, we have a different engagement channel than for somebody with five to ten buy-to-let properties, which is another segment of the market.  However, to the extent that somebody has a buy-to-let property that has now become the principal private residence because he or she has moved into it, or to the extent that he or she has a single buy-to-let property that makes him or her a consumer buy-to-let owner rather than a professional buy-to-let owner, the answer is "Yes."</p>
