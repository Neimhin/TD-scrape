Those categories would have been subject in previous years to the increases in pupil thresholds introduced for smaller schools.

The number of pupils enrolled in individual schools is provided in the national school annual census. Results from the census for the current school year, 2013-14, are being finalised at present. Publication of all data at first level and a final list of schools and their enrolments will be on the Department's website by the end of the school year. The information sought by the Deputy will be provided to him in the coming days. It should be noted that a total of 122 schools were due to lose a classroom teacher, 73 in 2012-13, which is the first year of the reduction and 49 in the 2013-14 school year, as a result of the small schools 2012 budget measure. The appeals process, which was part and parcel of that budget measure, reduced these losses to 43 in 2012-13 - the first year - and 32 in the 2013-14 school year. The list of these schools will be given to the Deputy.  The allocation process for the 2014-15 school year is currently under way. Early indications are that 34 primary schools are due to lose a classroom teacher for the 2014-15 school year as a consequence of the implementation of the final phase of the budget 2012 measure. I emphasise that this figure is preliminary at this stage and would be expected to reduce following the appeals process. The final position with regard to the figure will be known in the autumn.

It is unacceptable that we are unable to get specific details from the Minister on exactly how many children are in our national schools today. That information was provided to his Department as long ago as 30 September 2013, almost five months ago. I have asked the Minister on the floor of the Chamber today for specific details in regard to the different categories of schools, but the only information he has given is an indicative number of 34 for schools that are due to lose a teacher. He has given no indication of how many will not gain a teacher. What does the word "preliminary" mean in this context? After all, the Minister has had the information since 30 September last. Either the students are in the schools and the figures have been returned to him or they have not been. We know they have been and I do not see why he cannot provide that information to me today. I am asking for an explanation in that regard.

The system, which has been in place for a long time, used to take a whole year to return the data he is requesting, which means we would not have the final figures until next September. However, I am told by my Department's statistical section that the latest information will be published at the end of June, which is an improvement on the end of the year.

I am making special efforts to facilitate the Deputy. I hoped to have the information for him today but that was not possible in the time available to me. As soon as I can obtain it, I will convey the information to him directly and it will be available to any Member who wants it.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	How is the Minister able to provide an indicative figure of 34 for schools likely to lose a teacher? How can that particular number be extracted without extracting the other figures? It simply beggars belief. What is the Department doing if it cannot identify the number of students in the system and the number of teachers who will be employed next year? Schools have already lodged appeals in respect of the posts they are expected to lose, yet the Minister cannot tell me today how many and which schools will be in that category. I put it to the Minister that the Department is withholding this information because it does not want it to become clear which schools will lose a teacher and which will not gain a teacher as a consequence of the cuts that have been introduced. The Minister has targeted those cuts at the half of all primary schools which have five teachers or fewer. His failure to provide the information I have requested is unacceptable. The most recent available data show that as of September 2012, 124 schools are in the categories I indicated and are therefore in line to lose a teacher. We cannot assess how that figure compares with the figure for last year without access to the data I have requested. After five months, I can only conclude that this is a deliberate strategy by the Department. I cannot see how the information is so complicated that it cannot be made available to the public and on the floor of the DÃ¡il.

Regrettably, the information the Deputy is seeking is not readily available today, but I will get it for him or any other Deputy who requests such information. In this instance, the data will come with a health warning because they are provisional. Some of the schools in question may very well have pupils starting next September of whom they are not as yet aware, which would have an impact on the final figure. I will obtain the information for the Deputy, in so far as I can and as quickly as possible.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	I understand the Deputy is referring to how students are categorised for student grant purposes. For such purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances - as students dependent on their parents or legal guardians, or as independent mature students. A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he or she has attained the age of 23 on 1 January of the year of first entry to an approved course, or of re-entry following a break in studies of at least three years, and is not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the previous October. Otherwise, he or she continues to be assessed on the basis of parental income. Only in exceptional cases, where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents or guardians is provided, can candidates who are under the age of 23 be assessed without reference to the incomes or addresses of their parents or guardians. While satisfying the criteria outlined may cause some difficulties for certain students, I have no plans to change these eligibility arrangements.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I want to focus on people under the age of 23 who may be estranged from their parents. I will give two examples of the difficulties that are being caused. I know of a student who has provided SUSI with letters from her local general practitioner, from the counselling services within her college and from other Government Departments stating that she is estranged from her parents. I am trying to understand why SUSI has responded to this case as it has. The only statutory instrument I can find that relates to this issue is SI No. 159 of last year, Article 21(3)(b) of which provides that students may be assessed on their own means "where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant awarding authority" that the student "is irreconcilably estranged from both of his or her parents". The statutory instrument does not set out how that can be proven. It seems from the responses to the parliamentary questions I have tabled on this matter that the only evidence SUSI will accept must come from a social worker or from someone employed by the HSE. That creates problems for a number of students who might not have any business with a social worker or any interaction with HSE officials. That is where the problem lies.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	I understand the Deputy is talking about people under the age of 23 who are still deemed to be dependent on their guardian or parental home. I presume that in the cases of manifest estrangement which have been brought to the Deputy's attention by his constituents or by others, the evidence that was produced was not deemed to be satisfactory to SUSI. Is that correct?
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	That is correct.

If the Deputy is suggesting that we should revisit the definition of estrangement in the case of a person under the age of 23, with reference to the level of proof and evidence that should be supplied to SUSI, I will have a look at that as well.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I appreciate that. I want to record that the SUSI system has been much improved this year. Great advances have been made. The number of cases coming into my office this year is quite small. I had to deal with hundreds of cases last year. We are talking about a small number of cases of parental estrangement. I will mention the example of a woman under the age of 23 who is married and is living with her spouse. She is being assessed on the basis of her parents' income because she was living with them on 1 October last, even though she is now living separately from them with her spouse. They have their own income stream. These little issues are creating problems. Maybe we need to consider widening the burden of proof. The current approach, whereby the agreement of a HSE official or a social worker is needed, is too narrow and is creating extreme financial hardship for a small number of students.

I look forward to getting the precise information on that particular case. We will look at the general principle he has raised.

Every year between 80 and 120 babies with Down's syndrome are born in the State. At the moment approximately 200 children with Down's syndrome in national schools have no resource hours. Can we put this right? I introduced legislation recently and my objective is to ensure that all children with Down's syndrome are given adequate resource hours.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	The matters raised by the Deputy are currently the subject of High Court proceedings against the Department. I am therefore somewhat constrained in what I can say in response to this question. The NCSE report on supporting children with special educational needs recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children, including those with Down's syndrome, should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. The NCSE also recommended that, in the short term, pupils with Down's syndrome in the mild general learning disability category should continue to be supported by schools' learning support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a mild GLD. The NCSE working group charged with developing proposals for the new allocation model will bring its report to me before the end of the spring and any changes to the current allocation model will be considered in the light of the recommendations of that group. The Government did not oppose the Deputy's Private Members' Down Syndrome (Equality of Access) Bill 2013 on Second Stage. This Bill has now been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection for further consideration.

I also thank him and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, who was present on the day, for not opposing my Down Syndrome (Equality of Access) Bill, which is relevant to this debate. I take the Minister's point about the legal case. My objective is that all children with Down's syndrome and low-incidence disability are given the proper resource teaching hours. Children with Down's syndrome should be guaranteed to receive the maximum level of resource hours. Children with a physical disability get resource teaching time of at least two hours 33 minutes and up to four hours 15 minutes for children with autism. All young children with Down's syndrome going into national school should get the maximum resource hours because they can do a lot of work with them and achieve many changes which are very positive for their futures.

The NCSE was asked to provide policy advice on the issue of whether Down's syndrome should be reclassified as a low-incidence disability in all instances regardless of assessed cognitive ability. As part of the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs, it recommended that under the new allocation model proposed by the NCSE, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. This is a policy shift. The NCSE recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down's syndrome, who are also in the mild general learning disability category, should continue to be supported by schools' learning support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a mild GLD. The NCSE established a working group to develop a proposal for consideration of a new tailored allocation model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. I understand I will have that report in about six to eight weeks.

However, many families with children with Down's syndrome are in that category. They feel they are being penalised because some of these children are very good academically and are moving on. We can move them up to another level. The Minister will have seen the results in the case of families who put in the extra resources themselves and got their children up to junior certificate and leaving certificate level. Some are doing courses at third level, including a group of them in Trinity College, with which the parents are delighted. That is what educational inclusion is all about.We need to get the maximum educational value for these students to enable them to develop to their maximum potential. That is all I am seeking. It is as simple as that.

We should have a debate on this when we get the NCSE's report because it covers more than just the Down's syndrome category.

On this question, I ask the Minister the number of times and dates on which he has personally engaged in meetings with the teaching partners to discuss junior certificate reform proposals since becoming Minister, the status of progress on implementing the junior certificate reform programme, if he will commit to independent assessment of the new junior certificate student awards as recommended by the NCCA working group, and if he will make a statement on the matter.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	The Department, in consultation with me, established an education partners consultative group to provide all the education stakeholders with a formal medium for assisting in the planning of the phased implementation of the new junior cycle. This group first met on Thursday, 27 September 2012. Subsequent meetings were held on the day of the framework launch on 4 October 2012 and on 28 November of that year, on 22 January 2013, on 26 February 2013, on 26 March 2013 and on 26 June 2013. In addition, bilateral meetings have been held between union representatives and senior departmental officials since the autumn of 2013. The first meeting of the national working group on junior cycle reform took place on Friday, 17 January 2014. Three subgroups have been established to address continuing professional development, assessment and school resources. There was a meeting of the subgroup on resources on 24 January 2014, and further meetings of the subgroups on assessment and on CPD were held on 30 January 2014. Findings from the subgroups were reported back to the national working group on 7 February. Last Friday the CPD subgroup met for a second time. The other two subgroups will meet on Monday, 3 March, with the working group meeting on 7 March. During the entire period in question, there were also regular meetings of stakeholders through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment structures, including the junior cycle board and the council. I personally attended the following seven meetings with TUI representatives: a deputation from the TUI on 8 December 2011; a deputation from the TUI on 2 April 2012; the TUI annual conference on 11 April 2012; Gerry Craughwell, president of the TUI, on 3 December 2012; John McGabhann, general secretary of the TUI, and Gerry Craughwell, president, on 31 January 2013; John McGabhann, general secretary, Gerry Craughwell, president, Gerry Quinn, vice president, and Annette Dolan, deputy general secretary, on 21 March 2013; and at the TUI annual congress on 3 April 2013 in the Clayton Hotel in Galway. In addition, I personally attended the following five meetings with ASTI representatives: a deputation from the ASTI on 2 April 2012; the ASTI annual conference on 10 April; Gerry Breslin, president of the ASTI, on 12 December 2012; Pat King, general secretary, Gerry Breslin, president, Diarmuid de Paor, deputy general secretary, and Sally Maguire, vice president, on 21 March; and the ASTI conference on 2 April 2013. I also met the TUI and the ASTI representatives at the meeting that was held on the morning of the junior cycle framework launch. I have been fully briefed on the interactions between officials and other education stakeholders in relation to planning for the introduction of the framework for the junior cycle. The pace of change of the proposed introduction of the new cycle has been slowed. Next September, junior cycle English will be implemented, followed by science in 2015 and Irish and business studies in 2016. I went beyond the original assessment proposals of the NCCA. Unless assessment changes, nothing else will. To address concerns highlighted by the partners, I have agreed to look at external supports for moderation of school-based assessment. I have asked that a report be provided to me by mid-May on the findings of the working group.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	My question specifically asked the number of occasions on which the Minister has engaged with the teaching partners specifically on the issue of junior cycle reform. Junior cycle reform is something which, by and large, my party very much welcomes and had been involved with in the preparation for and the establishment of the working group. However, it is also something to which the Minister made changes after he came to office. At the ASTI teacher conference last year, he described it as a personal political project. That is why I specifically asked him for the occasions on which he met with those concerned to specifically discuss this personal political project of junior cycle reform. As the Minister knows, we are facing the prospect next month of the teachers holding lunchtime protests at school gates because of the way he has handled this. I believe the Minister has dealt with this in a very offhand manner and he has not engaged with the teachers in the way he needed to for something as important as junior cycle reform. The NCCA working group noted that:In countries such as Australia, Canada and Scotland, assessment for qualification includes an externally moderated school-based element. Such moderation provides assurance to all that where school-based assessment is used, there is consistency of standard across schools.The Minister changed that. I would ask on what advice he changed it and whether, in the process of doing so he consulted or engaged with those who are going to have to deliver it.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	I thank the Deputy for his supplementary question. The reply I have given clearly indicates to the House that I have probably met the two teacher unions in the second level sector, which are just two of the three unions involved in the education system and two of a large number of other education stakeholders, on numerous occasions. On every occasion, the future of the junior cycle was a point of discussion. The only thing I have changed is the method of assessment, based on the recommendations internally within my own Department. I did not wake up one morning and say we were going to do this on our own. It was done for a variety of reasons, which I am happy to discuss, although time does not permit me to do it here. However, I can assure the Deputy that the introduction of English next September for first year students will culminate in a new exam that will be worth 60% of the total marks they get for English in June of 2017, after the next general election, when the Deputy may very well be answering this question himself. It will be an exam in English that has been set by the State Examinations Commission and it will be assessed and moderated by the State Examinations Commission. If we went any slower, there would be no tangible movement. We are moving as slowly as we reasonably can to address the legitimate and understandable fears of change which some, but not all, of the teachers have.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	It is not necessarily about moving slowly, given we would like to see reform progress. It is about moving together. My key complaint and problem with the way the Minister has handled this is that the movement has not been together. Progress and reform is to be done in partnership, not by directive. On the two occasions when the timeframe was set for junior cycle reform to roll out, it was set by the Minister and announced in such a way that the media heard it before the education partners did. Then, before the working groups were set up last autumn, a new timeframe was put in place. How was that done? Was it done after consultation with the partners on this important education reform, one the Minister described as a personal political project? No. Once again, when it had become clear that the way and the pace at which it was to be rolled out were becoming a problem, instead of engaging and then reassessing how it would be rolled out, the Minister once again unilaterally set out a new timeframe. He then set up subgroups and working groups, which he was not part of, and left his Department to it. That is why we are now facing into a situation where the teachers are commencing industrial action and protest action at lunchtimes next month. The question specifically refers to the independent assessment and verification of exams. Will the Minister open his door to engaging with others who are involved in this process and to address the issues they feel are important, such as independent assessment and resources?

Deputy McConalogue keeps referring to the need for consultation. I believe in consultation but at the end of the day, politicians make decisions. Sadly, for the past 25 years, there has been no reform of the junior cycle because some people regard and spell consultation as "negotiation". It is not the same. There will be plenty of consultation but at the end of the day, politicians on this side of the House make decisions and are accountable for them. I am happy to be accountable for the decisions I have made following the professional advice I have received.

I wish to advise the Deputy that the decision-making authority for any school amalgamation belongs to the school's patron and this is subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills. The initiative for any amalgamation may come from a variety of sources such as parents, staff, board of management and patrons. Any such proposal to amalgamate schools must first involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders. Following the consultation process, a decision taken at local level will follow. In that regard, any proposed changes must be well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of students, parents, teachers and local communities, and contributes to an inclusive education system. The patron and relevant stakeholders are also advised by the Department to consider the implications that any amalgamation proposal may have on school funding, school staffing and school transport so that an informed decision can be made.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	Perhaps that is the way it should happen but, unfortunately, that is not what is currently happening on the ground. I will give the Minister two examples. The first is in Dublin 10 where there is a proposal by a patron body to amalgamate a number of schools and close one national school. The school it is proposing to close has specially built autism units while the school with which it is proposed to amalgamate it has none. Closing a school with specially built units dealing with autism and amalgamating it with a school that does not have those units makes no sense to me, and I am sure it makes very little sense to anyone else. The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, will be aware of the case of North Monastery Secondary School in Cork. This is a school with an educational tradition of 203 years that is facing closure. I will come back with a supplementary and inform the Minister of the shoddy way the Edmund Rice Schools Trust has dealt with not just the students, but the parents, staff and principal of that school and the distress and hardship this has caused.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	I am aware of the two locations where proposed amalgamations have been initiated by the management bodies and the patron. As the Deputy rightly said, the day-to-day responsibility for the management of former Christian Brothers schools lies with the Edmund Rice Schools Trust. The patron for Roman Catholic schools is the bishop of the diocese in which the school is located. The prime mover is essentially the Catholic authorities and the trust operating in the manner they do now. Deputy Conaghan has informed me of the situation in Ballyfermot to which Deputy O'Brien referred. The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, have brought my attention to the case in Deputy O'Brien's constituency. These are matters that the Department will facilitate and respond to but I must tell the Deputy that there have been no formal communications from both schools. We have been made aware of these matters not in writing but informally. It is a matter for the relevant authorities, including the parents and school community, to arrive at a satisfactory outcome. I understand - I qualify the word - that in both cases, it is due to falling numbers overall within the locations in which the schools are located and that some attempt at amalgamation and rationalisation was explored.This is how the matter stands, but I would love to see a proper amalgamation. Consultation is ongoing. In so far as the Department can be of help in those discussions, our services are available and have been in the past.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I thank the Minister. He is aware of both cases. The Edmund Rice Schools Trust, ERST, called in the staff and patrons of the four schools, including the bishop, and told them that the proposal was to close the North Monastery primary school and amalgamate it with St. Vincent's Convent national school, which is a fine school in its own right. The ERST then stated that it would hold a consultation period, but that is happening after the decision was placed on the table. The bishop must sign off on that decision. Perhaps he will go against what has been proposed by the ERST, but I do not believe that will be the case. The bishop will come under considerable pressure to agree to the ERST's decision. Ultimately, the decision will land on the Minister's desk for approval. That is when it will become a political issue. No one in the North Monastery primary school wants this to be a political issue. Rather, people want a decision based on the facts. The school has facilities like those in the Ballyfermot school and are greater than those of the schools with which it is proposed to be amalgamated. Despite this, there is still a proposal to close the school.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 138 together. As part of the Department's five-year school building programme, more than 20 new post-primary schools, usually of the order of 1,000 pupils per school, are being established across the country to cater for increasing demographics. A number of these schools have already commenced operation and the remainder will open between now and 2016. Generally, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The five-year plan is focused on meeting these demographic needs and sets out the school projects that are planned to proceed to construction. The Department will also consider applications from schools for funding for additional classrooms where an immediate enrolment need is arising. The Department continues to analyse demographic trends and monitor enrolments in all areas to determine the level of additional school provision that will be required in future and to ensure that this is provided in a timely manner. Alongside the building of infrastructure, we are also preparing for the need to have more teachers in the system. I have already asked the Teaching Council, the professional body for teachers, for advice on the matter of teacher supply and demand. I will meet it next week when this will be one of the items for discussion. The council is preparing that advice with the overall goal of ensuring that there is timely information to inform the system generally and planning in the Department. The model must be sustainable and adaptable to cater for evolving needs. I expect to receive an initial report from the Teaching Council later in the year.

The association's director, Mr. Clive Byrne, has predicted - I am sure the Minister will concur - a 15% increase in new students in six years' time.They are particularly concerned, as are others in the education system, that there are no data available on the number of teachers likely to retire in the next few years while we are experiencing that increase in intake, whether there is a disproportionate number likely to retire from particular subjects, and on the number of teachers emerging from teaching colleges sufficient that we do not experience shortages in particular subjects. Has the Department sought research on these figures? If so, where are we with it at the moment? Have any particular likely shortages for the future been identified?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The Deputy has pointed to a deficiency in the system that has existed for a long time. When I came into office, we had 19 colleges of education, providing initial teacher education for primary school teachers and for secondary school teachers. In light of the literacy and numeracy and on foot of advice, I agreed that the initial teacher education for primary school teachers should go from three years to four years, and from one to two years for secondary school teachers, with a focus on pedagogic skills in six new clusters of educational provision. The Deputy is right that the Department did not know how many skilled teachers we had at post-primary level, because post-primary level teachers tend to categorise themselves by how they teach subjects rather than teaching children, which is the definition of a primary school teacher. I have announced the decision in principle to begin to plan for the labour force of teachers. We will tell the colleges that educate post-primary teachers, for example, that we want a focus on STEM qualified teachers - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - and I will be bringing forward proposals on this. We will let the money follow our decision, so that schools of education will get money on the basis that they will give priority to graduate students who intend to follow certain kinds of teaching skills for which there is clearly a need.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	Deputy McConalogue has pointed out some of the issues we are facing in the post-primary sector. It is very hard to estimate how many teachers will retire out of the system and what their specialist subjects are. That will obviously have a knock-on effect. By 2020, we are looking at a 15% increase in the number of students at post-primary level, to a figure of more than 71,000 students who will all be taught particular subjects. We need to ensure the teachers coming out of the training colleges will fill the shortfall caused by those retiring from the system. We need to ensure there is not a shortage of specialised teachers in a particular subject, whether it is history or geography or whatever. The only way we can do that is by getting and analysing the correct data. The Department will have to undertake that.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	Any teacher who gets paid a salary by the taxpayer - 99.9% - from 31 January this year must be registered with the Teaching Council to get paid. There are 87,000 such teachers. We will now be exploring with the Teaching Council what their skill sets are. Most secondary teachers register and provide their first and second subject, and we will look at how that supply can be managed, as any prudent manpower policy would do. The publicity given to the NAPD's report sends a signal to people coming through an arts, mathematics or physics course that there will be employment for such teachers over the next few years. They can then apply to do a postgraduate course that will give them the qualifications for a post-primary teacher. We are concerned about this. We now have access to information that we never had before, and I intend to use that.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	It is also clear that we have become a leader in the development of ICT services, and that is likely to continue. It is important we have teachers in the STEM subjects.It is important to identify the skills gap. If we are to attract new teachers to take up these types of positions, we must bear in mind that they will have many other opportunities available to them and will be subjected to other pulls in the employment market. For this reason, ensuring an adequate supply of teachers will be a challenge. While the Minister stated he will consider a number of measures, a comprehensive approach is required and the Government must introduce policies to ensure teachers in these subjects are available when needed and a crisis does not develop in the system.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	I am pleased to note that under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, an educational review group is carrying out work specifically in the STEM area, which has been identified as an area of skills shortages worldwide. This flows naturally into engineering and information and communications technology skills. The Department will soon receive the report on the issue and will proactively manage labour market supply in post-primary education. Primary education is a less problematic area.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	My question relates to schools which have prefabricated buildings owned by the Department on which they do not pay rent. I raise this matter because rent is one of the criteria used for choosing replacement classrooms.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	The Deputy will be aware that I have sought to prioritise within available funding the replacement of prefabricated accommodation with permanent accommodation and that this work is progressing. Under the prefab replacement initiative, almost â¬60 million has been approved with the intention of replacing 575 rented prefabricated units in respect of 216 schools nationally. The permanent accommodation will provide modern, high quality accommodation for pupils and teachers. In the case of schools with purchased prefabricated accommodation which is in urgent need of repair, it is open to such schools to utilise their capitation grants, or minor works grant in the case of primary schools, to undertake such repairs. Where prefabricated buildings have significant structural issues, it is open to the schools to submit an application to my Department for the replacement of such buildings and each application will be considered on a case-by-case basis within the funding available. My Department requests that a technical report and supporting evidence relating to the condition of the prefabricated buildings and outlining the works required accompany any submission.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I commend the Minister and Government on the prefabricated school building replacement programme. Much good work has been done and many new classrooms have been built. I hope the Government, at the end of its tenure, will be recognised for having ended the scourge of prefabricated school buildings. One of the schools I deal with has a prefabricated building which is owned by the Department. The building is leaking and costs more to heat than the rest of the school buildings. I am pleased the Minister indicated that each application will be considered case by case. The school in question has submitted an application to the Department and I hope it will be considered favourably in future rounds of funding. The school authorities are concerned that the application may not be considered until such time as all rented prefabricated accommodation has been replaced. As I stated, I am pleased applications will be considered case by case.

While the question refers to the years 2011 to 2013, the centre has updated its review to 2014.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 120 together. The survey cited by the Deputy is focused on guidance counsellors, in particular on the time spent by them in a one-to-one setting giving career guidance and student counselling. It is important to note that guidance is a whole-school activity and does not only involve the guidance counsellor. For this reason, the implications of the survey are somewhat limited. Wherever possible, group work and class-based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils who are in most need of one-to-one support.  Section 9(c) of the Act requires schools to use their available resources to ensure students have access to appropriate guidance to assist them in their educational and career choices.Given that guidance is a whole-school activity and does not just involve the guidance counsellor, the type of data suggested by the Deputy would not give the complete picture on guidance provision. The returns my Department receives from schools is focused on pupil enrolments and this information is used to determine staffing and grant allocations. I do not intend to add to the administrative workload of schools by requiring them also to submit the type of information suggested by the Deputy. The Department does not hold any information on guidance counsellors, including their qualifications. Having teachers trained as guidance counsellors is of course valuable but given that it is a whole-school activity, we need to be careful that an emphasis on qualifications does not result in a restriction on who can best contribute to the needs and welfare of students. In regard to the number of hours guidance counsellors were given to do their work, it should be noted that schools have autonomy on managing guidance provision from within their standard staffing allocations. I do not intend to micro-manage schools in relation to guidance or indeed the subject choices they make. Furthermore, I am reluctant to add to their administrative workload by requiring them to make overly detailed returns to the Department. I am confident schools act in the best interests of students when determining how best to use the teaching resources available to them.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	The finding of the audit undertaken by the guidance counsellors was supported by the review of the National Centre for Guidance in Education which recommended the restoration of the ex-quota allocations for guidance. I accept that guidance is a whole-school activity, as the Minister said, but there is a need within schools for somebody to drive that. As a result of cutbacks, the middle management layer in our schools, particularly voluntary secondary schools, has been eliminated, resulting in the onus being much more on principals. This means they have too much work to do to be the driver of this. What we have within the guidance counsellor is a person with a basic qualification. I know, as I am sure the Minister does, that many guidance counsellors have done considerable courses in counselling and psychotherapy in their own time and at their own expense. These people are not being fully utilised. I will not argue with the Minister in regard to the statistics and the manner in which they are collected, except to say that I am speaking about people already in the system and the impact of cuts in this area. At a time when there is great emphasis on mental health and the promotion of mental health, we are eliminating a group of people who are highly skilled and can be part of that process. We are missing out on those skills.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	I welcome the Deputy's comments and acknowledge her personal experience in this area. I do not intend to return to the ex-quota system. I would like to see additional resources become available in order that we could increase the staffing allocation generally, but it is for the school leadership and principals of schools to decide how best to deploy those resources, although I believe I am at variance with some of the people in the Institute of Guidance Counsellors here in this regard. The Deputy referred to teachers with a basic secondary qualification upskilling to become guidance counsellors. There is evidence - largely anecdotal but we will soon have statistics in this regard - of massive investment in CPD by teachers across a whole spectrum of areas, of which counselling and guidance is but one. I would like to see that recognised in the first instance. Hopefully the registrar of the Teaching Council will be able to do this so that we will not have to undertake the type of statistical exercise mentioned by the Deputy. It is important we ensure best use of that skill set in our schools. I accept that as a result of cuts introduced in various budgets dating back as far as 2009, middle management has been hollowed out and this needs to be restored as soon as possible. I intend to do that.

Deputy O'Sullivan outlined the impact of the guidance counsellor cuts in terms of the promotion of mental health. Another key role of the guidance counsellor is career guidance. The survey carried out by the Institute of Guidance Counsellors indicates that one-to-one time has dropped to 41% of what it was prior to the cuts, which is having a real impact. At third level, 9% of first year honours students do not progress to second year. The percentage in this regard in the institute of technology area is 16%. Guidance counsellors are important in the context of the assistance they can provide in this regard. The Minister did not respond adequately to my question, which relates to the use of the facility database in the Department of Education and Skills. His response was that he does not intend to require schools to make any more detailed returns than they already do.

In replies to parliamentary questions I have put to the Department, I have been told that there is a facility database which holds the information but that the policy of the Department is not to extract that type of information.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	Thank you, Deputy. I have to call the Minister now.

The Minister outlined in his answer that he is leaving it to the schools. He suggested that it is their role to decide on the career guidance hours that each teacher should put in. However, I believe the Minister should also have a management role.

Another statistic indicates that fee-paying schools have lost less as a result of the impact of what has been happening with guidance counsellors. I acknowledge that for any ill that comes up in society the answer is that the schools will deal with it. We are losing the skill set of a group of people who could be leaders when it comes to addressing the ills that come up in society.

Does the Department currently gather the information? Is it, therefore, in the facility database? If that is the case, will the Minister make a policy decision to extract it in order that we can have that information?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	We do collect the information. Part of the difficulty relates to the ability to retrieve it in a user-friendly format. That is one of the things we are looking at. We had this exchange earlier in respect of primary schools. The information is gathered but it is stored in such a way that it takes a long time for it to be checked, double-checked and made available. I am not satisfied with the way we are using information and I hope we will be able to change and improve the situation so it can be accessed more readily.

Is that the case? If so, when is it likely to be initiated? Is there any further information that the Minister of State can provide to the House?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15056	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 114 together. The questions presume a possible future investigation by the European Commission. My Department has had no contact from the Commission in respect of such an investigation. I am aware that the Commission commenced an investigation on state aid to Bus Ãireann and Dublin Bus in 2007. The State's response was co-ordinated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and my Department supplied any information to that Department as required by the Commission. The State has maintained that the operation and administration of public service obligation transport services and the school transport scheme, respectively, are in accordance with the provisions of EU law. A decision on the investigation is awaited.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	I thank the Minister of State. Perhaps the question that faces the Minister and the Department is whether it might be time to reassess how the school transport scheme is being administered by Bus Ãireann. I understand that the legal basis for the scheme is grounded in a letter sent in 1967 to Bus Ãireann which gave the company total administrative rights over the school transport scheme. Furthermore, I understand that in 2009 a consultant report or review was conducted by RSM Farrell Grant Sparks which cost the Department â¬67,000 at the time. To my knowledge, that report or review has not been published although I gather there have been freedom of information requests relating to it. It would be enlightening, interesting and useful to be able to debate, discuss and analyse some of the recommendations which, I assume, were included in the report.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15056	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	We can look into the publication of the report to which the Deputy referred. I hope that answers her question.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	My understanding is that the matter is with the Information Commissioner. Presumably, the Minister of State's officials can fill him in on that. There is also a broad policy question as to whether there is an appetite on the part of the Minister or the Department to review this matter. The annual cost is approximately â¬166 million, which is substantial. Effectively, it is a comfortable arrangement for Bus Ãireann. I understand that some serious allegations have been made about how that is being administered at the moment. They are just allegations and I certainly cannot pass judgment on them, nor do I expect the Minister of State to do so. I do think, however, that this presents a good opportunity to reflect on and review the previous report, as well as examining alternative means of administering the school bus system and possibly injecting some competition and more transparency.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15056	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I am sure the Deputy will recall that during her time as a Minister of State, a value for money report was published on this matter. It was decided that we would continue on in the manner envisaged, in other words, that the relationship with Bus Ãireann would continue. The Deputy will also be aware of a recent High Court case which focused on the nature of the arrangements between the Department and Bus Ãireann. The essential thrust of that legal action was to seek an order from the High Court setting aside the existing arrangements for the provision of national school transport services. That was before the commercial High Court for a six day period. The court found comprehensively in favour of the Department and costs were awarded to the Department. The matter is now the subject of a Supreme Court appeal. To answer the Deputy's question, a value for money report was carried out on this matter and I do not envisage that the policy will be revisited at this point.

Has the Minister issued any guidelines either at primary or secondary level on this issue? What does integration actually mean? Is there a policy on or a definition of integration?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	The Department's policy is that children with special educational needs, including those with autism, should be educated in an inclusive environment in mainstream schools, unless the extent of their needs is such that they require specialist support which cannot be provided in mainstream settings. Schools are supported in integrating children with special needs in schools by the national psychological services and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. The Department has issued a range of policy and guidance documents for schools on integrating children with special needs, including children with autism. This guidance includes Special Educational Needs - A Continuum of Support, which was issued to primary schools in 2007 and to post-primary schools in 2010. In addition, special education circular 02/05, Organisation of Teaching Resources for Pupils who Need Additional Support in Mainstream Primary Schools, was issued in 2005, and Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post Primary Guidelines was issued in 2007. These documents are available on the Department's website www.education.ie. The NCSE is preparing policy advice on educational provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I thank the Minister for his reply. How many special classes are there in the country? What percentage of primary and post-primary schools have special classes? Does the Minister know how much time children spend in special classes and how much time in mainstream classes? How are school principals to decide on this breakdown? What guidelines provide that advice? What is the input of the local special educational needs organisers on this issue?How does the Minister define integration? Is there a definition of what constitutes integration? I understand there is no such definition. Does the Minister agree that one is needed? Has an evaluation been carried out with regard to the success or otherwise of special classes? If not, is it intended to carry out such an evaluation?

The individuals to whom I refer are prevented from completing such an upgrade by virtue of the fact that they pursued similar courses at a similar level previously. Would it be possible for a review to be carried out in order to identify those whose skills have not been adequately upgraded?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	The objective of the student grant scheme is to help as many students as possible obtain one qualification at each level of study. Given the level of demand on the student grant budget from first-time students and those who are progressing with their studies to a higher level, there are no plans at present to change the arrangements in place.  Eligibility for the back to education allowance and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social Protection. It should be noted that out of a total of 92,000 applications for the 2013-14 academic year, assessed by Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, on 18 February last, some 1% of students were refused on the basis that they had previously completed courses at the same level.

I fully accept what he said. At second and VTOS level, most of the cases which have come to attention involve individuals whose skills - developed on previous courses - have not been sufficient to allow them to meet the challenges of the workplace. In view of the fact that many of those involved are young people, would it be possible to carry out an assessment, within a reasonable timeframe, in order to ascertain the extent to which their skills might be improved by virtue of further education? Clearly the qualifications those to whom I refer have already attained are not quite satisfactory.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	The Deputy made some interesting points and we will ensure that they are considered in the context of Springboard and other specific labour market-friendly programmes. If skills shortages are identified, those to whom the Deputy refers can apply for entry onto such programmes and maximise the possibility that they will eventually be offered employment.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I understand that in reply to a previous question from Deputy Finian McGrath, the Minister indicated that the needs of children with Down's syndrome would be met as part of the overall review. However, this will not do anything for children who are due to start school in September of this year and whose applications need to be completed by the end of March. What does the Minister intend to do to cater for those children?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	Pupils with Down's syndrome who have a mild general learning disability receive resource teaching support from teachers allocated to schools through the general allocation model. The recent National Council for Special Education, NCSE, report on supporting children with special educational needs recommended that, under a proposed new allocation model, all children, including those with Down's syndrome, should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need rather than by disability category. The NCSE also recommended that, in the short term, pupils with Down's syndrome who are in the mild general learning disability category should continue to come under the general allocation model in the same way as other pupils with mild general learning disabilities. This will remain the position in September 2014. As the Deputy may be aware, the NCSE is working on a new general allocation model and I hope to receive its report on that matter in approximately eight weeks time.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	The problem with the Minister's answer is that the new allocation model will obviously affect all children with disabilities, which is entirely appropriate. However, the current system discriminates against the condition of Down's syndrome or does not bestow on it an adequate rating. Comparisons have been made with autism. For the very small number of children who are in the category to which I refer, who are due to start school in September and whose parents must complete their applications by the end of March, they will be left behind and assessed under the old model - which discriminates against Down's syndrome - rather than being treated in the same way as, for example, children with autism.Given the life-changing potential provided by those resource teaching hours for these children and the very small cost to the State, I ask the Minister to consider introducing an emergency measure to deal with them while awaiting the overall review model to be initiated.

We will then need to consider the implications and whether to phase in any change, maintain the present system or alter the present system. I hope to have that report within six to eight weeks.

The new system will not be ready by then. Will they be able to avail of the new system?

#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	I am anxious to know what progress has been made on the draft leaving certificate course on politics and society. It is planned to roll out this course in schools. Voter turnout in the age group of 18 to 24 years in the 2011 general election was up by nearly 30% on the figures for the 2007 election. These citizens had the value of the CSPE course, which may have been a correlation rather than a causation. I ask the Minister to say what have been the developments.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 122 and 282 together. I thank the Deputies who have tabled these questions as the topic is of interest to anyone who is a Deputy. I have decided to make the subject politics and society available to students at senior cycle. On foot of this, my Department recently wrote to the NCCA seeking its advice on a number of issues which need to be addressed before the subject can be made available. Politics and society, as with many other leaving certificate subjects, is designed to be studied from the beginning. The curriculum for the subject has been published and is available from the NCCA. The only issues outstanding are when it can be commenced. I advise Deputies with an interest in this area to look at the curriculum and the recommended textbooks. I would like to think that students starting transition year next September could aim towards taking politics and society as a leaving certificate subject three years hence. There may be some issues around the preparation of examination questions but we need to do something of this order and I am very committed to making it happen.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	92	I am glad to hear that such progress has been made. I hope the resources will be put in place. If the review of the CSPE project shows that the subject will be an optional subject, will a whole cohort of young people be disenfranchised? Citizenship should be taken seriously. The current emphasis is on the STEM subjects but the kinds of skills required in pursuing a course like politics and society such as open-mindedness, reflectiveness, problem-solving, are integral to driving an economy and we should train our young people to do that. In most advanced democracies such as America, France and the UK, low voter turnout among young people is a particular concern. We should act because the date of 23 May is looming large. I note the young people in the Visitors Gallery who I am delighted to see here but many people have never had the option of coming to visit the DÃ¡il. For example, the day I was elected was the first time I was ever here and I do not think that should happen. I think I should get in here again but I will not be repeating my first day.

It is a question of identifying the teaching qualifications. As we all know, we may all be elected but that does not necessarily mean we are qualified politicians, per se. We have arrived here with different sets of qualifications. The teaching of politics is not as specific as teaching one of the STEM subjects to which we referred earlier. I would hope to have the subject available as soon as possible for young people entering transition year next September.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Peadar TÃ³ibÃ­n - the need to provide a housing solution for persons forced into homelessness: (2) Deputy Jim Daly - the need to allocate capital funding to upgrade the N71 access route to west Cork; (3) Deputy Pat Breen - the future of EirÃ­ Corca Baiscinn, a community owned and run radio station in west Clare; (4) Deputy Derek Nolan - the urgent need to discuss the doubling of the carbon tax on solid fuel in the last year and the effect that this will have on prices; (5) Deputy Michael Creed - the lack of supports for children with special needs and-or disability to access preschool services; (6) Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy - to ask if the Government would consider a proposal of mine to make it easier for members of the public to engage in the public consultation process; I propose that a website, www.consultation.ie, be established which would be a one-stop shop for members of the public to navigate in order to find out about public consultations relevant to them. Government Departments, State agencies, local authorities and joint Oireachtas committees would provide details of their public consultations at that location. It could be operated along the lines of the e-tenders website and has the potential to be a piece of real reform in terms of improving the relationship between the public and our State bodies. Public consultation is potentially one of the most effective ways that we can give meaning to terms such as "engaging" or "listening" or "involving" the public. Public consultation is inherently fair and so protects the political system from accusations of serving interest groups more than citizens. For instance, if developed properly such a website could assist the Oireachtas committees achieve a much healthier level of participation in their public consultation exercises; (7) Deputy Denis Naughten - the need for the Minister for Health to explain to DÃ¡il Ãireann why the HSE failed over a two and a half year period to inquire into the basis for high death rates from stroke and heart attacks in a certain hospital which was exposed following the publication of the report, Health Care Quality Indicators in the Irish Health System: Examining the Potential of Hospital Discharge Data, published last week; (8) Deputy Brian Stanley - the need for a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed export of wind energy to Britain; (9) Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan - the need to discuss recent developments in relation to Moore Street; (10) Deputy Michael McCarthy - the position regarding the claw-back of single farm payments and the ongoing land parcel review. Approximately 25,000 farmers face penalties ranging from â¬50 to over â¬10,000 in the review of 900,000 land parcels by the Department. This amount does not take into account the possibility of the fines for some farmers being multiplied fivefold if the Department moves to impose the penalties retrospectively. More than 40,000 letters have been sent to farmers notifying them of irregularities. Many farmers will have penalties imposed on land that they were told was an excellent habitat when they were in REPS. This is a source of huge concern to farmers, particularly in west Cork, where farms comprise significant amounts of rock and furze, who are now expected to bear the brunt of the claw-back. These farmers are also coming under extreme pressure as the penalties are coming on top of mounting pressure to pay bills, which are higher than normal following the fodder crisis; (11) Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan - the issue of people being excluded from self-building, otherwise known as building by direct labour, under SI 9 of 2014, Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014; (12) Deputies Brendan Ryan and Kevin Humphreys - the need to address concerns regarding the Irish airlines superannuation scheme; (13) Deputy Jonathan O'Brien - the need for the Minister for Social Protection to discuss the increasing difficulty persons in receipt of rent allowance are having in locating accommodation; (14) Deputy Arthur Spring - the position regarding the claw-back of single farm payments and the ongoing land parcel review. Approximately 25,000 farmers face penalties ranging from â¬50 to over â¬10,000 in the review of 900,000 land parcels by the Department.

Kitt - to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government what plans are in place to deal with the need for additional social and voluntary housing, with specific reference to the Ballinasloe Society of St. Vincent de Paul building project for the elderly; (18) Deputy Robert Troy - the actions planned to tackle the increase in cyberbullying; (19) Deputy Terence Flanagan - the need for adequate funding to prevent the closure of Kilbarrack youth project; (20) Deputy Billy Kelleher - the need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on when progress will be made in providing access to the life-changing medication for severe asthma, Omalizumab or Xolair, to patients in Cork University Hospital; (21) Deputy Mick Wallace - the need to discuss the implementation of the free GP care scheme for aged children under six years; (22) Deputy SeÃ¡n Ã FearghaÃ­l - the need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on his plans for universal health insurance; (23) Deputy Clare Daly - the need to discuss the implementation of free GP care for under sixes and concerns of the medical profession about the scheme as proposed; (24) Deputy Eamonn Maloney - the need to ensure that proposed changes-amalgamations of schools are carried out following consultation with all stakeholders in an open, transparent and timely manner; and (25) Deputy Joe Higgins - the proposal to close Scoil Mhuire Fatima, North Monastery, Cork and amalgamate with another school off site with no prior consultation with parents and teachers. The matters raised by Deputies Michael Creed; Robert Troy; Michael Colreavy; and Brendan Ryan and Kevin Humphreys have been selected for discussion.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	Yesterday afternoon, members of the family of Sylvia Roche Kelly, her mother, sisters and brother, came to see me at their request. They told me that up to quite recently, they were never told anything about the totality of issues surrounding the murder of their daughter and sister. They were unaware that the person who had murdered Sylvia Roche Kelly had some months earlier savagely abducted and beaten a woman, Mary Lynch, whose name is now in the public domain. He was released on his own bail of â¬200. While out on that bail, he abducted a young five year old child at 3.45 a.m. in a Tipperary household but, thankfully, he was intercepted by the child's parents and a brave garda living next door who arrested him. Incredibly, he was given bail again and went on to murder Sylvia Roche Kelly. Her family had one simple message for me which is that they want answers about what happened. They are entitled to very basic and straight answers to the questions they now have, as do the other victims of the very serious assaults and endangerment contained in the dossier I sent to the Taoiseach last week. These families and these victims do not need ten volumes of material or paper; they need simple explanations. That is why I ask the Taoiseach, given the sensitivity of the issues involved, the fact that issues of security are involved and public confidence in the administration of justice, that the only way to deal with this is to initiate a commission of investigation with full High Court powers and compellability and a capacity to deal with such issues effectively and efficiently. I ask the Taoiseach to do that. I ask the Taoiseach if he will indicate to the House that he agrees that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, should come before the House to withdraw the statement he made that the whistleblower, Maurice McCabe, did not co-operate with the Garda inquiry into penalty points and that he should not have said that. One could put a Jesuitical interpretation on this direction from the Garda Commissioner on 14 December.We have this spectacle of communications between the Commissioner and the whistleblower simply to facilitate the Minister's stubbornness and his reluctance and refusal-----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	Everybody can understand how sensitive and important this is for people who are victims of crime, particularly the family of a good woman who was murdered. No more than the victims of any other crime committed throughout the country, people have a right to have trust and confidence in our justice system. Public confidence in An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and in its oversight is rightly an issue of great importance to this House and the Members who serve here. In recent weeks a number of events have served to weaken and undermine that confidence. I am determined that public confidence in these fundamental institutions be maintained and rebuilt. The best way of achieving that is to establish the truth in all of these matters. To this end, the Government today made three decisions. First, we approved an amendment to the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, currently before the House, which will enable serving gardaÃ­ to bring complaints directly to the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na Ombudsman Commission. Second, we decided that pending the enactment of this legislation, an interim confidential recipient will be appointed to receive complaints from serving gardaÃ­. The Minister for Justice and Equality was mandated to proceed with the required consultation with those who have to be consulted so that an appointment can proceed quickly. Third, we decided to appoint Mr. SeÃ¡n Guerin SC, an experienced and respected criminal lawyer to conduct an assessment of the various issues and allegations that have been raised by Sergeant Maurice McCabe since 2008. As Members are aware, Deputy Martin gave me material from Garda McCabe last week which contains very serious allegations against members of the force. I am aware, as is everyone else, that the good sergeant has been in contact with the Garda authorities, GSOC, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Committee of Public Accounts, other Members of the Oireachtas and the media, as is his right. Much of that correspondence related to the penalty points issue which was the subject of the report by Garda Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony that was published last year. The issues raised in the material given to me by Deputy Martin do not relate to penalty points. Most of the incidents mentioned have now been publicised in the media, whether in newspaper reports or on television. They include a number of very serious allegations against people, including serving members of the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, which I am not in position either to investigate or verify. Many of these allegations have been the subject of investigation by senior gardaÃ­, the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na Ombudsman Commission and-or the Director of Public Prosecutions. In some cases, people have been tried and convicted. In addition, we must all be mindful that there are currently at least two court cases ongoing which relate directly to these issues. In dealing with these matters, therefore, it is important to remember that these were not victimless crimes. They have been very painful for victims and families, as alluded to by Deputy Martin. That is why I regard the issues as being very serious and I have considered them carefully. However, I am not in a position to verify the veracity of or investigate the claims. Nor would it be feasible or appropriate for me to seek to investigate whether and how these matters were dealt with by the Garda authorities, GSOC and the DPP, all of whom are, quite properly, independent in the conduct of their responsibilities. I am, however, acutely conscious that the scale of the public discussion around these matters could have implications for confidence in the administration of justice in our country. There is a need to address these concerns and put in place a process that can do so quickly and effectively. For that reason, the Government has asked an independent and objective legal expert, Mr. SeÃ¡n Guerin SC, to examine and assess all the relevant papers and recommend what further action might be taken. If he recommends that a commission of investigation should be established, it will be done. The terms of reference for this work are currently being finalised. The report, which we hope will be completed before the Easter recess, will be laid before the Oireachtas by me and published. I believe this is a prudent way to proceed in view of all of the comments, allegations and documents that surround these matters. In addition, the Government agreed last week that recent events have now given rise to a clear need to review the operation of the oversight structure and the relevant legislation. That is why the proposed hearings by the Oireachtas justice committee into these matters are crucial. I hope they can commence as soon as possible. Mr. Justice Cooke may also make recommendations in that regard, as may Mr. Guerin. My intention is that the Government will bring forward proposals for the reform of the current Garda oversight and complaints systems by the summer. It is my clear view that the current system is not working as effectively as our citizens and our police force deserve and our democracy requires. It must be modernised and reformed. Tomorrow, I intend to have statements in the House all day, except for Leaders' Questions, to be led off by the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Minister is quite happy to attend and will finish up those statements with a question and answer session for any Members of the House who wish to ask him questions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	103	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Of course I accept that he is not in a position, in any shape or form, to arbitrate on or test the veracity of the very serious material in the dossier he has. However, that material was with the Minister two years ago and was supplied to the confidential recipient over two years ago. The Taoiseach knows, having read it, that the material jumps out at the reader. It is not satisfactory to say that because a person was convicted of murder in one instance, this is the end of the matter. That misses the point entirely, as the Taoiseach knows. The senior counsel the Taoiseach is appointing will not have a statutory basis for his investigation, will not have powers of compellability and so on. The only vehicle that can enable the Government or the Oireachtas to do that is a commission of investigation under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. That legislation has proven to have the capacity to investigate these matters, which are very serious and which, in fairness, the Taoiseach has acknowledged as being very serious. It is the only vehicle to do it effectively, efficiently and with confidence. For the victims and the families of the victims - at least the family I met - their big fear simply is that this will all be covered up again. I am just making the point that from a layperson's perspective, that is how they look at the world. That is how they look at desktop reviews and all the palaver and general language around all of that. Unfortunately, that is the conclusion they will be afraid of. I noted from the Taoiseach's reply that he has not ruled out a commission of investigation. I would have been happier if the Government had appointed the senior counsel and given him the task of scoping out the basis for a commission of investigation. That would be a stronger position and one that could quite readily be done. The Taoiseach would have my support if the role and function of the senior counsel is to scope out the basis for the initiation of a commission of investigation and to meet the key people concerned and engage with them.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	I do not think there is any difference of opinion between the Deputy and me or anybody else in the House about what we want to do here. We need to have the truth of these matters. We need to have confidence, credibility and integrity both in the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na in the conduct of its affairs on behalf of the people of the nation and also in respect of GSOC. The Deputy gave me this documentation just last week and we now have a response to it as to what we intend to do. I am not in a position to have the documentation from the DPP or GSOC. These bodies are completely independent of this House. The Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, on the directions of the Commissioner, investigated quite a number of the allegations that were made, but the report I have here in respect of assaults and the conduct of gardaÃ­ in that is directly contradictory to those findings. Who am I to believe here? We are working in the interests of having answers for people so that clarity is brought to this. That is why Mr. Guerin SC, who is an experienced criminal lawyer, will assess the investigative methods that were carried out on the papers that are available to him. I expect that everybody will co-operate with this, including the Garda, the DPP where relevant, GSOC, the confidential recipient and the Department of Justice and Equality.What I have in mind is that the SC, with a criminal lawyer's practice, will look at that process, make recommendations and present a report to me as Taoiseach. I will bring the report before the Oireachtas and have it debated publicly. Clearly, if he recommends that further work is required here, in terms of an investigation, that shall be done. On a number of occasions in the past, a scoping exercise of merit was carried out and this justified the setting up of investigations. As the Deputy is well aware, that is what happened in the case of the scoping exercise that led to the commission of inquiry in the Morris tribunal in Donegal many years ago.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	Hopefully - there is a lot of paper here - he can report to me before Easter and we can decide then on the best thing to do here. As I have said, GSOC and the DPP are utterly independent of this House. Investigations into this matter of public interest have taken place. As the Deputy is aware, some of these allegations have been investigated by the Garda Commissioner, by GSOC in part or in full, or by the DPP. That work has been done. It is now necessary, in the interests of truth and credibility, to have the truth established here. The Deputy started off by asking a question about the family of a good woman who was murdered. I feel for that as well. Clearly every person in the House, irrespective of who they represent, understands that we need clarity, integrity and credibility. I hope this can lead to that. As I have said, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, received documentation from the whistleblower on 23 January and responded on 24 January. He received a very long piece of correspondence from the Garda Commissioner about the investigations that had taken place with regard to the matters mentioned in that letter. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, will deal with that tomorrow morning when he opens the statements here.

It is a fait accompli. The SC is in place. He is going to report to the Taoiseach. The rest of us will sit and listen as we get it from RTE or from elsewhere. We should be able to come in here and discuss it. The Government should listen to what we have to say before it comes to a decision. There is a credible and acceptable way of bringing this chaotic episode to a conclusion. That would have involved the establishment of an independent inquiry as provided for under the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004. That would have taken it out of the political brouhaha that has been going on for some time. As the Taoiseach knows, these are profoundly serious issues. A person has been killed and others have been assaulted. Confidence in the administration of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and of justice is being eroded. Here is the nub of it. The Taoiseach received this report last week. He has now invited this SC in to tell him what he should do. The Minister has had it for two years. Sergeant McCabe's allegations go back to 2008.

Has the Taoiseach asked the Minister what he has done about this in the two years he has had it? This reminds me a wee bit of the case of Pat Finucane, about which we are concerned. I have to stress I am not drawing like with like. When it came to the point at which Pat Finucane's case should have been dealt with, the British Government brought in Judge Cory. It became a delaying tactic. The issue is still not resolved. I appeal to the Taoiseach respectfully to review the decision he has taken. I suggest that he should give this SC the power under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, or else listen to what is being said in here and take this matter out of the political realm by going straight into an independent inquiry under the 2004 Act. That would take the Taoiseach out of it. He has said that the SC will report back to him. He has read the dossier, so why not do what he is able to do as an acceptable way of bringing this to a conclusion?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	113	I share the Deputy's view in respect of the late Pat Finucane. I will make the case again when I go to London in the near future. I decided to make a proposition to the Government this morning. The Government agreed with that proposition, which was that a senior counsel with criminal law experience should be appointed to assess the investigative methods and processes that were followed by a number of agencies here. As I said to Deputy Martin, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, acted immediately when he received this information in 2012. He read it and he responded immediately through his Secretary General to the Garda Commissioner.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	As I said to Deputy Martin, the point is that 12 distinct allegations were made in respect of a superintendent. The Secretary General sought a report, which was received four days later. A reply was received by the end of January of last year. In that reply, which was quite extensive, the Garda Commissioner outlined how 11 of the 12 allegations had already been made through the confidential recipient system and had been thoroughly investigated in an investigation headed by an assistant Garda commissioner and a chief superintendent. The report of that investigation, together with all the supporting documentation, was presented in ten volume files to the DPP. After considering the material, the DPP directed that no prosecution should be pursued, on the basis that no criminality was disclosed against any member. That is the decision of the DPP's office, which is completely independent of the Oireachtas. When I received this material from Deputy Martin, I decided that I was not in a position to make a judgment on it. First, it would be inappropriate for me to have that material. Second, I do not have the authority to demand it. We have asked for an effective process to be put in place to deal with this. I want to see this resolved. I want to see that everybody understands exactly what happened and that the truth be known. We have got a competent person with criminal law experience to go through all of these papers and report back here. I chose that it be so because Deputy Martin gave me the material. I did not show that material to the TÃ¡naiste. I did not show it to anybody else in the Cabinet. I did not send it to the Department of Justice and Equality. I did not send it anywhere else.

This is a question of the way business is done in this State. It predates this Government. There is a cosy relationship between the political elites and those who are at the top of State agencies, the Civil Service and big businesses. We have seen so many examples of that recently. People are sick of it. They listened to what the Taoiseach and the Labour Party said during the general election campaign about the need for a new way of doing these things. This is the old way of doing them. What happened over GSOC? There was to be a review. What is happening now? A senior counsel is being brought in to do a review. A process is provided for under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which gives the Taoiseach this authority. I am not asking him to make a judgment - I understand that is not within his authority. I understand the separation of these different agencies and so on. There is a process which takes it out of politics. That is the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. That is where it should have gone. Perhaps we will go there if that becomes the recommendation, but why wait when people are hurting? The whole political and public narrative for the last number of weeks has been totally monopolised by this issue, so why not free it up? Why not do the big thing and let that investigation proceed as it is to under the 2004 Act?It was put in place to deal with issues such as those the Taoiseach has just articulated. Let us play catch-up with the North on some of these issues. It is not acceptable for a Garda Commissioner to be accountable to any politician. There should be an independent Garda authority. I welcome that the Protected Disclosures Bill is to be changed. Sinn FÃ©in, through Deputy Mac Lochlainn, has argued for that. We are now giving gardaÃ­ the right to go to the Ombudsman, which is a very basic and modest step. However, there is no protection for whistleblowers, and the very person who should have protected the whistleblower, the Minister for Justice and Equality, failed to do that. I hope this goes well, particularly for the families who have been hurt, and we will certainly give it a fair wind. I return to what I asked in my original question. The Taoiseach had this for less than a week and he moved to take this action. The Minister had it for two years. The allegations have been about since 2008 in the various agencies to which this garda was entitled to go. This is a step and it is positive enough, but it is too small a step and falls short of what the public wants if confidence is to be restored.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	Given the importance of this, I have been very careful not to deviate from the fundamental issues, namely, to restore integrity and credibility in An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na in its competence, professionalism and in how it interacts with the people, and the independence and oversight responsibilities of GSOC. However, it is a new way of dealing with an old structure. There have been four Ministers for Justice and Equality since 2007: Mr. McDowell, the late Mr. Lenihan, Mr. Ahern and now the Minister, Deputy Shatter. This covers that span. Through the investigation by the Garda Commissioner and through the investigation by the Director of Public Prosecutions, 11 of the 12 allegations were found to be groundless. I have a different version here from Sergeant McCabe. We are being asked to ascertain the truth of the matter. The DPP and GSOC are independent entities with which the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is not satisfied and has not been satisfied for a couple of years because his view was that we should not have a confidential recipient process because it has not worked effectively. That is why today the Government approved an amendment to the Protected Disclosures Bill to provide for gardaÃ­ to go to GSOC directly and not have an office of confidential recipient, although under the legislation we have to appoint an interim confidential recipient in the meantime. We need to take all the paperwork and put some coherence on it because we could all be talking and arguing for the next two years without having a focus on many of the allegations that may arise. It is prudent and a good proposition to appoint someone with experience in criminal law to take all this paperwork, put it into a coherent fashion and make recommendations on the assessment of the investigative methods that were followed. If that means having a commission of investigation, that is what will happen. When this comes back to me in my position as Taoiseach, I will lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas and we will have a public debate on that. The issue of protection is clearly an issue. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at the effectiveness and standards that apply in the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na Act 2005 and Mr. Justice Cooke may make some recommendations in that regard also. I have listened to people of stature, some of whom have served on GSOC, making points about its inadequacies. They will have the opportunity to make their contributions in public session before the Oireachtas committee. I believe that is a good engagement with civic society in the interest of having that integrity of our police force and the independent oversight body put in place.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	There is a social and affordable housing crisis. More than 100,000 families are languishing on local authority housing waiting lists. These families cannot afford to buy or build their own homes and cannot access mortgages. In addition, because the Government has slashed the income limits to qualify for local authority housing, thousands of other families cannot get on those lists, cannot access mortgages and are condemned to private rented accommodation for the rest of their lives. Social and affordable house building by local authorities and voluntary housing agencies is almost non-existent. The local authority house building budget was decimated by the Government, down from â¬367 million in 2010 to â¬65 million in 2013. Similarly, the voluntary sector budget was reduced from â¬70 million in 2012 to â¬55 million in 2013. The local authority social and affordable house building programme has been privatised by the Government, by bailing out landlords and developers, by shoving â¬500 million of public money into their deep pockets through the payment of rent supplement each year and paying their mortgages over and over again through rental accommodation and leasing schemes. The ESRI has advised that we need to treble the house building programme. We have read that the Government has a draft housing plan. However, based on press reports, it relies solely on financial incentives for developers to build. It also apparently proposes to remove the requirements for builders to provide a proportion of social and affordable housing in each development. With 100,000 families on local authority housing waiting lists and thousands more who cannot get on those lists, will the Taoiseach ensure direct investment in local authority and voluntary housing agency house building? Are there any proposals in this plan, which the Government is apparently preparing, for such investment?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	123	The Deputy has raised a matter of very considerable concern to people. Clearly he and everybody else is aware that during the so-called boom years we built nearly 100,000 housing units when we had a requirement for perhaps 25,000 or 30,000. We are now building 6,500 to 8,000 when we need 25,000 to 30,000. Of course these cannot be provided overnight. I am well aware of the pressure, particularly in city areas on the need for detached housing for families, many of whom are now caught in apartments or rented accommodation that is not suitable. Considerable work is going on here. The Minister, Deputy Burton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, have initiated a pilot project in Limerick for the housing assistance payments scheme, which will be of interest to local authorities. That should be in legislation by early summer. On Thursday we will have a meeting of the Cabinet dealing with the construction sector in general, which will be of interest to the Deputy and others. We need to get the construction sector to contribute far more to the economy than it is. It used to be at 24% or 25% and is now down to 6% or 7%, which is much too low. Clearly Deputies are aware of the pressure on local authorities for social housing. There is a programme in place for this year for the recommencement of local authority housing. There is to be a debate on housing in the DÃ¡il in the next two to three weeks and the Deputy will have his opportunity to make a longer contribution to that with his many suggestions. The Government is conscious of the issue and it will be a feature of what we will discuss at Thursday's Cabinet meeting.

Obviously it will cater only for those who can afford to buy these houses or get mortgages for them.It will not cater for local authority housing applicants or those who have failed to get on the housing lists because the Government has reduced the income limits significantly. The issue I raise was highlighted today by a family who are protesting outside the office of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, because of the rent caps that are in place by the Government. That family are constituents of the Minister. This is an urgent matter. It is an emergency situation for the 100,000 families who are on these waiting lists and for those who cannot get on the lists. There must be a huge increase in investment in social housing. There is a real housing emergency and the Government is relying on a wing and a prayer of private developers and the market which failed us in the past. I again ask the Taoiseach whether he will significantly increase the income limits for local authority housing. The Government has slashed them by half whereby families on less than â¬25,000 per annum cannot get on those lists. Will the Taoiseach immediately commence a local authority and voluntary agency house building programme to ensure those 100,000 families and the others who cannot get on that list have proper housing?

The Minister for Finance has already made it clear that NAMA is offering 4,000 units that are available for housing.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	Admittedly some of them may not be in the proper locations and some of them may not be committed but it is an offer of 4,000 units. The social and public housing programme is clearly too low and it is not meeting the demand we have. When Ireland was building 100,000 houses when 30,000 were needed, clearly the private sector area was very expensive, to put it mildly. The housing assistance payments scheme, which will be of interest to local authorities, will be tested in a number of pilot areas beginning in Limerick and should be law by the summer. The question of having more public housing capacity available and the question of income limits will all form part of the discussions and proposals that come from Members on the housing debate-----

Four appointments have been made to the National Statistics Board in recent months. Three appointments relate to the appointment of civil servants on the board, as provided for in section 18 of the Statistics Act 1993. The fourth appointment relates to the re-appointment of the existing chairperson of the board. I have also recently made one appointment to the board of trustees of the Chester Beatty Library for a period of five years. I have not made recent appointments to the board of the National Economic and Social Development Office. Details of the appointments I have made are set out in the following tables.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	I thank the Taoiseach for the comprehensive nature of his reply. I accept that many of the appointments he makes would fall under the Department of the Taoiseach or either be nominations by outside bodies or, as the Taoiseach said in one instance in the reply, the appointment of civil servants to a board. As the Taoiseach knows, the proposed chairmen of State boards were to go before committees and that was something that he hailed as a revolution three years ago, although it is hardly a revolution. Will he accept that this process has become highly controlled? The only time it looked like a Government nominee might be in trouble, the Government backbenchers were whipped into line. Is the Taoiseach happy with the position that it is all a fait accompli in advance in terms of the appointments that are being made? There is much evidence that, notwithstanding the advertisement of appointments, Ministers are basically ignoring the process in reality-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	This is a very confined question.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	It was at a Government meeting of 12 April 2011 that decisions were made to put in place new arrangements inviting expressions of interest in vacancies on boards and agreed that Ministers would not necessarily be confined to those who made expressions of interest. It was decided that those who were being proposed for appointment as chairs would be required to make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas committee to discuss the approach they would take in the their role as chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body or board in question, and that following those discussions a decision would be taken by the Minister or the Government, as appropriate, to confirm the nominee as chairperson. I do not know of any great row that occurred at any of these committee meetings yet, although that may well happen. As the Deputy well knows from experience, it is not all that easy sometimes to get people of competence and expertise to serve on these boards. It takes a particular kind of person to do that but I think, by and large, it has been an opportunity for Members of the House at committee to quiz the proposed appointee. It may not be revolutionary but certainly it allows for an engagement that did not happen previously.

Does he, for example, regard as a matter of principle that one advertises publicly before one chooses somebody? How does he explain the fact that since the Government came to power, according to an Irish Examiner study, of 1,067 appointments by the Government, only 191 people came through the public advertisement process?

Is it not the reality that the political cronyism that dominated the appointments to boards in the past is still alive and well?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	No. I do not accept that at all. Clearly, that applies in every situation. People who apply for positions or for jobs are not necessarily going to be chosen by virtue of the fact that they apply.

The principle I would apply here is that people should be appointed to these boards who have a contribution to make, who have an understanding of what public service means and who are prepared to give of their time, experience and expertise in the interests of the board or body upon which they serve.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	153	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together. I visited Japan from 1-5 December in response to an invitation extended to me by Prime Minister Abe during his successful visit to Ireland in June last year, following his attendance at the G8 Summit at Lough Erne. The key objectives of my visit to Japan were to further increase Irelandâs trade, economic and political relationship with Japan and to explore potential areas for future collaboration between our two countries. I was accompanied on the visit by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, reflecting the very significant potential for co-operation and trade in the agrifood sector between Ireland and Japan. While in Tokyo, I had a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and welcomed the opportunity to resume our conversation on the enhancement of bilateral relations between our two countries. The Prime Minister and I noted the very positive development of political and economic relations between Ireland and Japan in the recent past and resolved to expand this bilateral relationship for the mutual benefit of both countries, including by encouraging greater levels of trade and investment. We noted that 2017 will mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Japan, and we decided to set that timeframe as a target for achieving a number of specific projects involving economic, cultural and research collaboration. To this end, Prime Minister Abe and I agreed on a new partnership for growth and innovation, which will provide a framework for the development of relations between Ireland and Japan over the next four years. The declaration will provide a platform for a new phase of Ireland-Japan co-operation in a wide range of areas, and builds on recent work at home to enhance relations with this key global actor. I briefed the Prime Minister on the current economic situation in Ireland and on what was then our impending exit from the EU-IMF programme of assistance. I explained how we have restored our economy to growth and stabilised the national finances in a short space of time. The Prime Minister, in turn, briefed me on his Governmentâs success in revitalising the Japanese economy through his three-pronged economic model, commonly referred to as "Abenomics".
I welcomed the announcement by Japan that it is reopening its beef market to Irish exports. The decision means that Japan is open to Irish beef for the first time since 2001 and marks Ireland as one of a select group of countries allowed to export beef there. I am satisfied that the announcement is another key milestone for the Irish agrifood sector, the beef sector in particular. It is a sign of international confidence in the quality of Irish food and is a further vindication of Irelandâs focus on quality and sustainability. Prime Minister Abe updated me on Japan's relationship with China and noted ongoing maritime and territorial issues. I said that these are clearly very sensitive issues and that Ireland, along with all EU partners, would encourage all countries to resolve them in a peaceful manner, through dialogue and diplomatic engagement, and in accordance with international law. During my visit to Tokyo, I also had the great honour of meeting with Crown Prince Naruhito and with the Japan Ireland Parliamentary Friendship League. I met with Japanese and Irish companies which are active in research and development and the services sector at an event designed to increase collaborative research projects for the mutual benefit of both countries. I attended a symposium on green energy, co-organised with the Japan External Trade Organisation, JETRO, to highlight opportunities and latest technologies being developed by Irish companies with core strengths in this important priority sector for both countries. I delivered a keynote address on current and future developments in Ireland-Japan relations in a globalised world at the Japan Institute of International Affairs. I was accompanied on my visit by a large number of company representatives with business interests in both Ireland and Japan, including groups from the ICT, financial services and agrifood sectors. The mission also included a special programme for Irish food exporters seeking market outlets in Japan. Following two days in Tokyo, I travelled on to Nagoya and Osaka for further meetings with Irish and Japanese business leaders to promote trade, investment and business-to-business links. I also met with the Governor of Osaka Prefecture, Mr. Ichiro Matsui. I was delighted to have an opportunity to visit Japan as part of our ongoing strategy to promote trade and investment, to strengthen Irelandâs international reputation and to convey to a wider audience the extent of Irelandâs progress toward economic recovery. Ireland and Japan have a long and well-established political and economic relationship, and this visit provided an opportunity to develop our economic, political and cultural links somewhat further. During my visit to Japan, I was pleased to have the opportunity for a brief informal meeting with US Vice President Biden, who was in Japan as part of a wider visit by him. I will answer questions tabled by Deputies on that in the next group of parliamentary questions.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	154	Ba mhaith liom an Taoiseach a mholadh as an chuairt a thug sÃ© chuig an tSeapÃ¡in roimh an Nollaig. TÃ¡ a lÃ¡n deiseanna dÃºinn sa tÃ­r sin. BhÃ­ mÃ© ag caint le Martin McGuinness agus tÃ¡ a fhios agam gur bhuail an Taoiseach le PrÃ­omh Aire agus an Leas-PhrÃ­omh Aire, Peter Robinson agus Martin McGuinness agus molaim sin fosta. BhÃ­ an bheirt sin an-sÃ¡sta bualadh leis an Taoiseach agus sÃ­lim go mbeidh muid Ã¡balta leanÃºint ar aghaidh i gceart ag obair le daoine sa Tuaisceart. Mar a deir an seanfhocal: NÃ­ neart go cur le chÃ©ile. Molaim an obair thÃ¡bhachtach seo. The Taoiseach knows there is huge potential. Half of the world's population is in the Asia-Pacific region and within a decade it will account for half of the world's output, so increasing our political investment and trade ties to the region makes sense. I very much commend the Taoiseach's visit and the work he did there. The establishment of a partnership for innovation and growth, covering the range of issues the Taoiseach outlined, is an important and very welcome initiative, as is the Japanese Government's decision to reopen the Japanese market to Irish beef, which is potentially a hugely important matter. With regard to the other issues the Taoiseach outlined as having been discussed with Prime Minister Abe, particularly around the EU-Japan free trade negotiations, when does the Taoiseach expect to see the detail and will there be an opportunity for the DÃ¡il to debate these issues? The Taoiseach also raised the issue around the tension involving China and Japan, and other Asia-Pacific nations, over territorial waters and the exploitation of their resources. That brings us to how we, a small place, can influence these matters. It also brings us to the issue of reform of the UN, because it is clearly an international agency that has a particular function in that regard. The Sinn FÃ©in position is that it does need reform, particularly the Security Council. Was the Taoiseach able to tease out any of that? In March 2015 the third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction will be held in Japan. While I do not know if the Government has had the opportunity to consider this, will this State be represented at that conference? I note, and thought it very positive, that the Taoiseach met with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister while he was there, and I know he did the same thing in regard to China and other initiatives he has taken on jobs, exports and so on. I note also that Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, joined the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, on a joint trade mission to Singapore recently. Are additional steps being considered to promote co-operation between the Executive and the Government on job creation, economic growth and similar initiatives? There is a need for us not to compete with each other, particularly when we are dealing with this in a global way. Most people away from Ireland see it as one island, and clearly we should be marketing it in that way. I thank the Taoiseach for his answer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	155	Deputy Adams raised a couple of important points. First, I did have the opportunity to refer to the tensions that exist between China and Japan in regard to the Senkaku-Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea.I pointed out that as a very small country in comparison to the populations in China and Japan, we have had some experience of difficulties and troubles and how they might be resolved by dialogue and negotiation rather than confrontation or unwanted events. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Dame Catherine Ashton, has already visited there on a number of occasions, as indeed has Vice President Biden, which was the subject of a different question. For our part, I said that after 30 years of difficult and tension-filled periods, the Good Friday Agreement was put in place. The Prime Minister was conscious of that although they are clearly enormous powers in their respective areas. It is important to note that from a cultural point of view, the name of Lafcadio Hearn is of significant importance in Japan and that the Japanese people through the ambassador are anxious to contribute to the provision of a cultural garden in Tramore in County Waterford because of Lafcadio Hearn's impact on Japanese literature and culture. It is important that we note that the first western adviser to a Japanese emperor was an Irishwoman called Eileen Kato who was originally from Crossmolina, married a Japanese diplomat and had an important responsibility in advising the emperor before she passed away. Obviously, the status of the emperor of Japan changed after the Second World War.  Deputy Adams is correct when he points out that the populations are of enormous significance. This is why the Government is looking at opening an embassy in Jakarta and is trying to impact to a greater extent what we can do in Japan, China and other countries. We are always happy as a Government to assist the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. It happened in China and Japan. During our Presidency, we were happy to have some personnel from Northern Ireland in the permanent representation in Brussels so that they were fully acquainted with what was going on. The Bruton-Foster visit to Singapore was important in respect of the potential to supply goods and services to many of these areas. I hope that this can continue.  It is important for the House to reflect on what is happening with the debate between Europe and Great Britain and the debate between Northern Ireland and Europe because there are implications depending on what the Scottish people do in their referendum later this year and what the future holds. One can very quickly see the impact of many of these things in the Swiss constitutional vote in respect of migrant workers and the impact of that on the European Union and its attitude. It is important that we understand that these things have implications and that we need a debate and understanding between the Government, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister relating to Northern Ireland and the wider context.  Some of the companies I met in Tokyo and Osaka were major operations. I recall the "Origin Green: Natural and sustainable Irish Food and Drink" breakfast I had with many of the companies. They are very intrigued by the quality and standards of Irish food. Some of the financial people are extraordinarily wealthy in terms of their capacity to invest. I came across quite a number of young Irish engineers working for different firms in Japan, learning new ways, having different experiences and also contributing to the challenge of the frontiers of the digital world, mechanics, engineering, physics and all these things that are having an impact on us.  I had never been to Japan before and I must say that I found Japanese people to be absolutely respectful, really interested in a country like Ireland and very anxious to understand the philosophy driving Ireland and to do business with us as a gateway into the EU. From the Government's perspective, we will follow through with visits by other Ministers to build on these relationships, which will yield benefit for our people in terms of jobs here and our economy in the times ahead.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	156	I welcome the Taoiseach's visit to Japan, particularly the theme of developing a very strong, deep and enduring relationship with the Japanese people. Of course, he will acknowledge that this has been a historic feature of our relationship going back 60 years. Much work has been done over the years, particularly on the academic and research side. I pay tribute to the Higher Education Authority and Science Foundation Ireland for some of the work they have been doing. They deserve credit for much of the work that has now led to a formal research partnership, which I warmly welcome. I have been on a number of trade missions to Japan in a previous role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We were the first to initiate the idea of companies from Northern Ireland coming along on an Enterprise Ireland trade mission. Out of that experience has come my view that if one is looking for a new North-South body relating to indigenous enterprise and companies in the Republic and Northern Ireland, like the tourism agenda and selling the island of Ireland abroad, there is much to be said for synergies between the two bodies in terms of promoting companies on the island in far-flung areas like China and Japan. It pools resources, makes the marketing arm and footprint of Enterprise Ireland available to companies in Northern Ireland, makes the marketing expertise and footprint of Invest Northern Ireland available to companies in the Republic and gives them wider opportunities to travel on trade missions to sell their products, goods and services. It is one area that should be pursued in terms of rejuvenating the North-South agenda. There is much that could happen there without threatening anybody or anyone's political perspectives because I have no doubt that companies, as the Taoiseach has probably experienced, really have no issues with that at all and welcome the opportunity to gain access. When one combines our respective diplomatic networks with the enterprise agencies, one can achieve a lot for the companies involved, particularly those Irish indigenous companies that want to export and gain increased sales. I welcome that joint endeavour with the Northern Ireland Executive and companies. Does the Taoiseach have the up-to-date position regarding Japanese foreign direct investment? From the 1970s and 1980s, a wave of Japanese companies came to Ireland. The benefit of Japanese companies in Ireland is that they have been very loyal, notwithstanding the up and down nature of the economic cycle. They have a different approach and tend to stay in for the long haul once they come to a country, particularly Ireland. I have a sense that initial wave has not been replicated. I am not criticising anybody other than to say that I would have thought our footprint could have been stronger from an IDA Ireland perspective. It is stronger now. The question is whether we are getting the level and volume of foreign direct investment we could expect and whether we could improve on that. Is the Government committed to providing the funding to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and is it satisfied that the back-up and resources from a personnel perspective are sufficient and strong enough to reflect the push that must be made to get investment from Asia? The 21st century will be about Asia in terms of economic growth and development so we must be there.  I warmly welcome the opening of the beef market. That has been a long journey of negotiations and lobbying going back to the initial outbreak of BSE. The opening of the market is a good outcome for all our veterinary staff and those who worked hard behind the scenes. It will not be an easy market because standards are extremely high in Japan.It is the best market to which to export if one wants to test the quality of one's products. They will not survive if they are not up to the mark. The opening up of that market to Irish beef is a welcome step and, hopefully, will provide greater diversity to our farmers, exporters and food companies. The Taoiseach met Vice President Biden on his visit to Japan. I do not know whether it would be appropriate to-----

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	158	There is a group of questions coming up on that matter.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	I thank Deputy Martin for his comments. I agree - I think this is a good suggestion. I recall when I was Minister for Tourism and Trade the Canary Wharf bomb - I think it was in 1996 it went off - and the Earls Court tourism show was to take place two days later. People at the time were saying it should be called off in its entirety. Up until that point, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord FÃ¡ilte were in two separate stands. The agreement was to put them all on the one stand. For the first time ever, we had the island of Ireland expressing itself as a tourism location. I agree with Deputy Martin's suggestion. These are important elements of synergies and collaboration and, therefore, greater benefit. I must say that, both in China and in Japan, I had the opportunity to meet with the First and Deputy First Ministers and our for own Government representatives, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and so on to meet with their counterparts. It was taken in that spirit because there are services and particular specialties in Northern Ireland that are not available here. Between both of them, the island of Ireland can gain as a consequence. I think that is a good suggestion. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, Minister Foster and their counterpart from Britain were the first "troika", if one likes, to go to Singapore. We hope to be able to continue that. The Commonwealth's reach of offices is so much greater than we could afford as an entity here and I am sure those facilities are available for this kind of visit. Inward investment is not as strong as it could be. There has been a 20-year recession by Japanese standards in Japan. Prime Minister Abe's engagement was a signal of prime ministerial interest in Ireland as a growing nation in terms of what it is that we offer - IT, pharmaceutical, software, data storage, analytics and all of these areas. He made it clear that the companies with which we met, some of which are in banking, financial services, engineering and so on, could see this country as a launching pad into Europe. I hope it will improve and increase. Certainly from my experience of talking to Japanese companies, they are seriously interested in a country with stability and in a country that is making a serious effort to get out of its economic difficulties. They clearly understand the distance that Ireland has travelled in a short time. If we keep up the level of engagement with them in terms of visits and back-up in terms of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA we hope we can get this level of investment to a higher state. Prime Minister Abe was very interested in being able to finalise the approval of entry of beef to the Japanese market. Deputy Martin is right - there is no room for messing here. The standards have got to be what the Japanese people require. In that sense, when I was there for two days, they had quite a number of meat producers from Ireland in Japan learning exactly the standards of cut that they require. The producers and their skilled personnel were in the factories, where it was demonstrated how it should be cut and presented for what the Japanese people require. In that sense, they do appreciate that, as a grass-based industry here, the quality of what comes in Irish beef is of exceptional levels but it has got to be presented right. In that sense, that message has got through very clearly. My view is that this is a market that we can grow again to more than the â¬15 million that it was before. Since we were blocked out in 2001, it is a challenge to build it up to what it was, but the standards will speak for themselves. Those in the meat business know that there is no opportunity for wasters, inefficient production or inefficient levels of service. For the Japanese people, in terms of what is presented to them, perfection is the requirement. One of the points made to me by one of the major firms was that goods being damaged or scratched or packages being dented in any way was not acceptable. One company built its own plant in Japan for packaging goods for distribution to Japanese customers because it is not acceptable that the goods be in any way inferior in terms of what they demand. So, they set standards across the board. It takes a little time to understand the extent of just how perfection is an issue with them culturally. To break into the market requires patience, understanding, consistency and that level of perfection, something that struck me very forcibly. Something that is not acceptable in Japan might be acceptable in other countries.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	161	It is not surprising that the Taoiseach would get on well with the Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, since both come from neoliberal and conservative political parties on the right wing of the political and economic spectrum. Apart from the business of adding a few ha'pennies of trade to the pence of trade while the Taoiseach was there, did he discuss with the Prime Minister the bigger picture and did he learn any lesson from Japan's disastrous economic situation of the past 15 years? I am sure that his advisers briefed him on the large property bubble that was built up, the land bubble, the significant speculation that occurred and the inevitable crash, as is part of the workings of capitalism, which led to a disastrous deflationary period for a considerable amount of time. As a result, the debt-GDP ratio is 230%. The Taoiseach seems to have learned much in Japan but where the two key elements of the Prime Minister's policy, those being, fiscal stimulus and monetary easing, are concerned, the Taoiseach is continuing with the exact opposite - failed policies of austerity, bank bailouts, etc. This policy failed in Japan for years, requiring the turn by its current Government. Investment was also very low because big business was not re-investing sufficiently to create a stimulus. While I am always cautious about what the outcome of "Abenomics" will be, given the fact that we are still working within the parameters of the capitalist economic and financial markets, the internal workings of which caused the ongoing crisis regardless of who was in charge, has the Taoiseach considered how he needs to learn from the deflationary situation that existed in Japan and the requirement for a change in policy in Ireland to end the austerity, and for major public investment in real job creation? I will ask a last question.I am sure that the Taoiseach was probably quite envious of the Prime Minister and his party, considering that they have been in power since 1955, apart from about four years, in spite of a very dubious history of the American CIA fashioning quite a bit of their policy over the years, corruption scandals and all the rest of it. In spite of the Taoiseach's close conservative links with the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, I do not wish him similar success in terms of longevity.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	162	I thank the Deputy for that. We looked at the bigger picture, which is the programme of expansion and investment being considered by Prime Minister Abe and his government. Japan is an extraordinary country, with an extraordinary standard of living and an extraordinary level of investment, despite the fact that it has suffered recession for many years. The Deputy asked about the situation here and the European Central Bank. I made this point on many occasions. Our priority for 2014 is to focus on our indigenous economy. Hopefully we can achieve 2% growth this year, 2.5% next year and 3% the year after that. This means a challenge of creating 50,000 net new jobs this year and the same again next year. Banking is an issue here, in Europe and all over the world. We want to see banks contributing to the real economy here. That means access to credit for small and medium enterprises, and the opportunity to follow through on incentives that can be provided. We need to do something about our construction sector, which is not contributing what it should. Hopefully, we can make it much more effective than it is at the moment. The European Commission presented a report to the European Council some time ago of 800,000 jobs being available in the digital sector by 2015. We have a lot of opportunity in Ireland with all our potential, but we need to develop that. Mr. Draghi has made his position very clear about holding interest rates steady and on issues which Europe should follow. The European Parliament noted the opportunity for assistance to be given to Ireland for recapitalisation of legacy banks. That is still on the agenda and meetings held in January reaffirmed this. Banking union and similar steps towards making that case, while they are not of direct interest to Japan, are of interest to us. I am not really interested in the Deputy's comment about the longevity of political parties. That is for the people to decide. They are always masters and judges, and we have to live by their decision. If the Deputy is in this business and does not understand that, then he should not be in it in the first place.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	163	That is true. Does the Taoiseach have any additional scÃ©al about the Japan-EU free trade agreement negotiations, as well as the strategic partnership agreement? How close does he think these are to concluding?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	164	They deal with these things at official level sector by sector. The same thing is happening with the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, between the EU and the US. I do not have an up-to-date report on the intricacies of what they are talking about, but I can send the Deputy a report on when they are expected to be concluded. Obviously this is of interest to us.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 14, inclusive, together. I visited Japan between 1 and 5 December 2013. While in Tokyo, I was delighted to have an opportunity for a brief informal meeting with US Vice President Joe Biden, who was in Japan as part of a wider visit to the region. This was not a formal meeting, and we did not have an opportunity to engage in substantive discussion on policy issues. We briefly discussed our respective visits to Japan. I mentioned my meeting with Prime Minister Abe the previous day, at which we had agreed a new bilateral partnership for growth and innovation between Ireland and Japan. I also mentioned the very welcome announcement by the Japanese Government that it is reopening its beef market for Irish exports. The Vice President outlined the broad nature of his visit to Asia, including his trips to Japan, China and Korea.  We also spoke briefly about Irelandâs economic recovery and our impending exit from the EU-IMF programme of assistance. We briefly touched on developments in Northern Ireland, including the process being led by Richard Haass to deal with flags, parades and the past. We also discussed the state of play of the US immigration reform legislation, an issue with which the Vice President is closely engaged. We did not discuss corporation tax issues, or the matter of the appointment of a US ambassador to Ireland. The recently appointed US ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, who is well known to us in Ireland, accompanied the Vice President at our meeting. She spoke of the success of events held in Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the death of President John F. Kennedy, and how appreciative she and her family were of the hospitality afforded to them during their visit to Ireland. Finally, I mentioned my plans to visit Washington for the St. Patrickâs Day celebrations in 2014, and I reiterated what is a standing invitation to the Vice President to visit Ireland during his tenure of office.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	166	I understand the Taoiseach cannot deal with all the issues at these meetings, but the absence of a US ambassador here since December is important. I commend the former US ambassador, Dan Rooney and his wife Patricia, who have deep and commendable connections with this island. For the three years he was here, he represented his country ably and engaged in a very modest but cheerful way with people here. Will the Taoiseach raise this issue when he visits the US next month? I would also like the Taoiseach to raise the issue of the so-called undocumented Irish. The figures are staggering and beyond my comprehension. Four hundred thousand people, mostly young, have left this State in the past five years. Between April 2010 and March 2013, 20,000 people left for the US, most of them in their 20s. That is a huge vote of no confidence. That is double the figure of the previous three years. We should think of the damage to society, to communities and to families. Many travelled on a student visa or by other means. It is estimated by the Irish emigration lobby that around 50,000 of these Irish citizens are living illegally. I am sure the Taoiseach will meet them when he goes there. They are working on building sites, in pubs and restaurants and wherever they can find employment. They did not go for the craic, as a lifestyle choice or for the experience. They went because they had no long-term employment prospects here. They had little prospect of meaningful work because of the disastrous policies of the previous Government and the austerity policies of this Government. Perhaps it is okay for single people, but many of them now have families and are living in a twilight world. They pay taxes and contribute positively to US society, but when it comes to a bereavement or a more joyous family occasion like a christening or a wedding, they are not able to travel back here because they are afraid they will not be able to return to the US. They live waiting for a rap on the door or for a visit at work from immigration officers. Leas-UachtarÃ¡n Biden has spoken out on this issue. Unfortunately, the Taoiseach did not raise it with him, but that is fair enough. There is a reform Bill going through Congress that has passed the Senate and is now stuck in the House of Representatives.Will the Taoiseach raise this issue when he travels to the United States? I understand that many of the difficulties arise from resistance among elements of the Republican Party. Will the Taoiseach make arrangements to meet congressional Republican leaders and raise this matter during his visit?  The Constitutional Convention proposed that Irish citizens living abroad have the right to vote in presidential elections. While I presume the Taoiseach did not raise this matter with Vice President Biden, will he raise it with political leaders in the United States when he visits in March? When does the Taoiseach intend to act on this proposal? I may have asked him that question previously.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	167	The House has a number of reports from the Constitutional Convention to debate. I commend Tom Arnold and all of those who participated in the convention, including public representatives and, in particular, the 66 citizens who attended its meetings and contributed to its various debates in the past 12 months or thereabouts. The Government must respond to each of the different reports from the Constitutional Convention within six months, indicating what will be its response, for example, in terms of the possibility of holding referendums and so forth. We have already commented on a number of the convention's proposals. The appointment of a new ambassador to Ireland is strictly a matter for the US President. No one can influence his decision, which depends on who he wishes to appoint. I spoke to one person who was approached to become the US ambassador but had to decline for health and family reasons. While I am not privy to the discussions that have taken place on any other appointment, the American side is well aware that we are anxious about this issue. I hope to have an opportunity to raise the matter with President Obama if the appointment has not been made before we meet.  Deputy Adams is well aware of what is happening in terms of immigration reform legislation in the United States. He is correct that some concerns have been expressed by members of the Republican Party. The nomination of Republican Party candidates in different districts and states for forthcoming elections may have a bearing on this issue. I hope to have direct discussions with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Boehner, during my visit. If so, I will raise this matter.  I commend the Irish ambassador to the United States, Anne Anderson, who has been very energetic on the Hill, as it is known, meeting leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress and the Senate. She also regularly updates the Government on progress being made in that regard. I also receive regular correspondence from the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform on its contacts and connections with Republican and Democratic leaders in Washington. I understand the group will hold an Irish day in Washington in the coming week or thereabouts and I hope to meet its representatives when I visit Washington. I am not sure if Deputy Adams is travelling to the United States for St. Patrick's Day. If so, we may have an opportunity to speak to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister if they are in the United States.  I hope we will achieve a breakthrough on immigration reform legislation. I do not believe the solution for Ireland is to have a separate, bilateral scenario, as with the E3 visa. If there is to be comprehensive immigration reform in the United States, it must be on a larger scale, which requires the co-operation of both the main parties. From a political point of view, I am sure this issue is of interest to both the Republicans and Democrats given the large number of people of other nationalities and from other countries involved and their potential impact on the electorate for forthcoming elections in the United States. As we move into the latter phase of President Obama's second presidency, minds will begin to focus on these issues. This is, therefore, an important year for consideration of immigration reform. I hope the members of the Republican Party who have been expressing some concerns about reform proceeding will focus on the issue. I also hope there will be collaboration to make reform happen. For our part, we will do everything we can diplomatically and politically. If that means sending out further cross-party groups to engage in discussions with individuals, we will be prepared to do that. I am well aware of contacts I receive, particularly from young people who are undocumented and not fully legal in the United States. It is always a source of concern to them that something may happen outside their control in respect of them being detained or whatever. That is not a good position and it is one that we and many American politicians would like to resolve. There is a bit of a blockage and I hope we can assist our US colleagues in dealing with it effectively in the interests of millions of undocumented persons who are in the United States.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	When will the Taoiseach next meet the Vice President and President of the United States? Will he outline his full schedule of public appearances on his visit to the United States during the St. Patrick's Day period? I gather from the Taoiseach's comments that the Government, in trying to secure a future for our undocumented friends and fellow citizens in the United States, believes that their circumstances need to be addressed at the same time as the plight of the estimated 11 million other undocumented persons living in the United States, many of whom are from Latino backgrounds. Is that correct? Unfortunately, many undocumented persons, including undocumented Irish people, are seriously exploited and open to exploitation and experience other human problems such as separation from family, fear and so forth, about which we know too well. Does the Taoiseach agree that the best approach would be for the tens of thousands of undocumented Irish and Irish communities generally in the United States to build powerful links and solidarity with Latinos and other people and nationalities who are fighting to secure recognition and obtain security of tenure in the United States? Does he agree that, rather than approaching the issue from a narrow national perspective with individual governments trying to make separate arrangements, the solution lies in all 11 million people, including Irish people, being given security of tenure in the United States? Is that not how the difficulties faced by Irish people and people of every other nationality would be resolved?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	What do we want here? What we strive to achieve is a path to citizenship for those who wish to live in America legally. Two options are available. While we could seek to reach a bilateral arrangement, the process of achieving this is not as simple as it sounds. The second option is to have comprehensive legislation to deal with all nationalities, as the Deputy correctly noted. This was the objective as long ago as the presidency of George W. Bush but the relevant legislation did not pass because of objections from some of the southern states. On 6 February last, the Speaker of the House, Mr. Boehner, gave a press conference at which he expressed doubts that the House would pass immigration legislation this year. He reasserted the view that immigration reform was required and indicated he would continue to consult members of his party.This might be impacted upon by the nomination process for representation in different areas. Given the height to which expectations were raised six months ago, this is a disappointment. We must remain engaged with the process and with those who impact on it. As I said, Ambassador Anderson is doing a great deal of work on this in Washington. It is important that people who have connections with the Republican Party in the United States engage with it and continue to press for address of the concerns of our undocumented and to provide, therefore, for a future, legal flow for Irish emigrants into the United States. I am happy to publish the itinerary of my engagements while in Washington, Boston and New York. I expect that the itineraries of every Minister or Minister of State travelling abroad will be also published. This is not only about attending the St. Patrick's Day festivities in whatever country but about engagement with Irish business interests, trade interests, cultural interests and so on. We are attempting to build an itinerary of value around each visit. This is not about travelling long distances to appear at St. Patrick's Day festivities but about a meaningful process around that. I am happy to have all the itineraries published.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	It is important a US ambassador to Ireland is appointed. Former ambassador Dan Rooney did fantastic work on behalf of both countries. While he was US ambassador to Ireland he considered himself to be an Irish man and was an outstanding representative. It is a pity the new ambassador has not been appointed to date. I would have thought that we would have news of that appointment in advance of the Taoiseach's visit to the US for St. Patrick's Day. There have been many false dawns in relation to the emigration story. Unfortunately, the key issue in terms of whether this will happen is domestic American politics. Notwithstanding what others have said in the House, I put it to the Taoiseach that it is important we keep an eye out for potential bilateral frameworks that would enable people to travel legally between our two countries. We have an historic relationship with the US, dating back many hundreds of years. Many of our countrymen were centrally involved in the American War of Independence and so on. For example, I negotiated the first working holiday agreement between our two countries with then Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte. I think Ireland was the first country to negotiate such an agreement. However, there were restrictive clauses in that agreement. It is not as liberal as the working holiday agreement we have with Japan or Australia. During the past decade up to 17,000 young people per annum were going to Australia on a one or two year work visa. Since the signing of the agreement with the United States fewer than 1,000 people have travelled, with only 500 having travelled in the first year. We can open up opportunities through the development of bilateral frameworks such as the E3 visa between Australia and the United States. I understand that the Hispanics are very clear on the need for a comprehensive agreement.  I dislike being pessimistic but, unfortunately, the complexities of the domestic political scene in America have frustrated attempts at a pan migration deal. This is a huge problem that has been ongoing into successive presidencies. I am not casting blame. I am a realist and understand realpolitik but I believe we need to open up two strands, all the time working with all of the other parties to see if a pan deal can be done while endeavouring to find out if a bilateral framework can be developed in some niche areas.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	As I said, this is an important issue. While there was heightened expectation that this might happen, on 6 February Speaker Boehner expressed doubt in that regard. It is clear from the outcome of the discussions that the upcoming district level primary contests and the November congressional elections are proving to be the dominant factors in Republican Party thinking. This was confirmed by Congressman Gowdy in a discussion with Ambassador Anderson on 12 February when he said that electoral considerations were the dominant part of those discussions. The TÃ¡naiste visited Washington on 11 and 12 July last and attended a series of meetings in Capitol Hill. He met with the US Administration, five Republican members of the House, three of them members of the judiciary committee and Minority Leader Pelosi. The TÃ¡naiste also wrote to Speaker Boehner. An all-party delegation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, led by the Chairman, Deputy Pat Breen and including Deputies Nash, Crowe and Senator Mark Daly visited Washington last October. They had 15 separate meetings with members of the US Congress during which they highlighted the position of the 50,000 currently undocumented. The delegation identified from their exchanges a will among Republican members to enact a set of piecemeal immigration reform measures, to which Deputy Martin referred. I do not rule out that but it might face serious challenges in the face of looming deadlines in terms of consideration of other matters such as debt ceilings and so on. For the Deputy's information, I will outline the latest position. Following passage of the Senate Bill on 27 June last the issue has been under consideration by the Republican controlled House of Representatives. Early last month, further public comments from Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Cantor and Chief Whip McCarthy again raised hopes that the Republican leadership in the House saw the need to proceed with immigration reform. To that end, they prepared a set of draft principles that would guide their action on immigration in the House and they presented them to members of their caucus for consideration at a meeting on 30 January 2014. Informed by this, Speaker Boehner gave his press conference on 5 February. These things are disappointing when expectations are raised. For our part, we will engage as comprehensively as we can with American representation in the hope of bringing this matter to a successful conclusion. It is in their interests as much as ours.

Is it the intention of the Taoiseach to allow for Government time? It has not been published formally yet but it has been well leaked by the Minister for Health and others. We need some clarity on when it will be published. It is a key part of the programme for Government. Will the Taoiseach indicate when the legislation to clarify the law surrounding assisted human reproduction, including the law relating to parental relationships arising from assisted reproduction, be published as well as the law regarding stem cell research? Is it the Taoiseach's intention to proceed with that commitment in the programme for Government? With regard to universal hospital care insurance, when does the Taoiseach expect public hospitals to be given autonomy as per the programme for Government?

We are advised that the health (general practitioner medical service) Bill is to provide a GP service to persons aged five years old and under. The plan was to have it in place by the middle of this year. The Irish Medical Organisation has strongly condemned the Government's refusal to negotiate and has also threatened a court injunction. Does the Government plan to negotiate with the IMO? How confident is the Taoiseach that the scheme will be up and running by the middle of the year? When will this health Bill be published? The second question relates to the health reform Bill, which is to put in place new structures for the health service as set out in the Future Care and the disestablishment of the HSE document. Will the Bill include reform of the ambulance service? There is widespread concern at the response times and the risks delays create for patient safety. In my constituency there have been serious examples of lengthy delays, including one at the beginning of the year in which a local citizen died. When will the health reform Bill be published? Will it include reform of the national ambulance service?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	Both Bills are for this session. Deputy Adams's first point related to the IMO and negotiations. This is being dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy White. It is not a negotiation process, it is a consultation and engagement process. The difference relates to formal negotiation status and formal negotiation rights. The Minister is keen to have a full, comprehensive, thorough and genuine engagement with the general practitioners. Both Bills are for this session. I cannot confirm the position for Deputy Adams in respect of the ambulance structure but the Bill will serve to put in place new structures and the replacement of the HSE. It will be published in this session.

A considerable amount of money is moving through banks for investment in land, acquisition, leasing of land and the purchase of land because of the importance of this. There is no need for transitional regulatory arrangements as far as I am aware but I will have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, respond to Deputy Kirk on that point.

Is there any possibility whereby the Taoiseach might consider, as part of the harbours (amendment) Bill, bringing forward appropriate legislation that would place responsibility for flood defences along the coast with a single unitary authority?In the context of the harbours (amendment) Bill, will the Taoiseach consider bringing forward appropriate legislation to place responsibility for coastal flood defences in a single authority? In that way, one agency could deal with the aftermath of the devastating impact on so many communities, including the farming community in particular.

Last week, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, received Cabinet approval for dispensing moneys to 120 different locations, which are small in scale but important nonetheless. That expenditure is proceeding. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Works is working with local authorities on their submissions to deal with major areas of damage, some of which are immediate while others are medium term. We also have to plan for the scale of the engineering challenge to deal with major defences in cities, towns and coastal areas.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	231	Work is under way to reform and consolidate the Domestic Violence Act 1996. It is planned that the reformed legislation will include provisions on emergency barring orders and safety orders. These reforms are needed to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of European Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, which is known as the Istanbul convention. The general scheme will contain provisions necessary to give effect to the EU regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters. The scope of the provisions to be included in the reformed legislation is still under negotiation with a number of Departments. Once agreement has been reached, the general scheme will have to be considered by the Office of the Attorney General before being submitted to the Government for consideration. It is anticipated, therefore, that the process will take some time, as will the process of drafting the consolidated Bill. The aim is to publish the general scheme before the summer recess.

However, it requires a working out of what are termed sustainable solutions - in other words, what arrangements one can make to enable people to get on with their lives without having a crushing weekly burden. It requires an engagement between both the lender and the borrower. Considerable numbers have been worked out. I do not think a change in the legislation would be equitable because similar changes would be required for every other sector as well.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for taking this debate. The issue of appropriate supports for children with disability in the preschool year appears to fall between the remit of a number of Departments. The Department of Education and Skills is responsible for children with a disability attending mainstream schools. I refer to a very welcome initiative in recent years which is the provision of special needs assistants. I have been pursuing this issue as have other Deputies, including my constituency colleagues, on foot of representations made to us about individual cases. I refer to last week's debate on a Private Members' motion tabled by Deputy Troy. While there is some momentum to address the issue, it still seems that no particular Department is willing to take ownership of it. To put the problem in context I refer to a letter I received from the HSE on foot of representations I made about an individual case. The HSE letter in reply reads: "There is no obligation for a service under the ECCE grant to take a child with special needs if they cannot provide supports." In other words, they can simply refuse to take a child and that child will sit at home instead. The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, will be aware that this issue is a long time on the agenda. In the 1996 report to the Government by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, it was stated on the issue of preschools that it should be the responsibility of the Department of Education to provide high quality appropriate preschool services to the children with disabilities. The Minister of State might well reply that she was not in office on that occasion and she may wash her hands of that report but the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan 2013-2015 states as an aspiration to improve supports for children with disabilities in the preschool year. It stated that the outcome desired is to improve school readiness and learning for children with disabilities and that one of the key indicators will be to have more than 50% of children in preschool year in receipt of appropriate supports. The flip side is that almost 50% of children with disabilities are not receiving the appropriate supports and I suspect that a substantial minority of those children who are not getting the appropriate supports are unable to avail of the preschool year and consequently start at a disadvantage in their formal education in the primary school system, behind their peers by virtue of a learning or a physical disability. I take my hat off to many of the community providers of early childhood education who through their own resources are providing funds for special needs assistants or other supports needed for these children. The system is too ad hoc. One child who cannot avail of the preschool year is one too many, but regrettably there are many children. I cannot quantify the number but perhaps the Minister of State can do so. I welcome the cross-departmental endeavour under way but I remain to be convinced that somebody is taking ownership of the issue, even if not to the extent outlined in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan 2013-2015,
which has a timeline to have this issue addressed by September 2016. It is feasible to have this issue addressed if there is a willingness to so do, by September 2014, in order that children with disabilities would be on the same footing as any other child and available to take up a place in early childhood education.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	I thank Deputy Creed for raising this matter. It is very obvious from his contribution that he has taken a considerable interest in this matter, which I appreciate. Notwithstanding the financial pressures on the health system, I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the ongoing delivery of vital services and supports to children with disabilities to the greatest extent possible within available resources. The free preschool year is provided through the early childhood care and education programme, ECCE, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. I note this is another Department which has entered the fray. The objective of this scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school. I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an over age exemption or waiver for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria, as well as the option to split the free preschool year over two years. While the HSE has no statutory obligation to provide supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free preschool year, it works at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as these arise. This is done in a number of ways such as providing grant aid to support preschool provision in community preschools and by funding special preschools catering specifically for children with disabilities. In some cases at local level disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream preschools by providing assistant supports where possible. As the Deputy suggested, the HSE national programme for progressing disability services for children and young people from birth to 18 years aims to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services. This programme, when implemented, should mean greater equity in accessing services based on need, clearer referral pathways to these services and improved collaboration between the sectors. An additional â¬4 million has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the programme. This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts. The HSE's role in supporting children with disabilities involves working in close co-operation with the disability service providers it funds, the education sector, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the parents and families of the children in question. There is a need to strengthen these arrangements, however, and a dedicated cross-sectoral team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, plays a key role in fostering greater collaboration on children's disability issues and building on the existing cross-sectoral working arrangements. A subgroup of this cross-sectoral team has been set up to examine the issues around the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream preschool settings, building on previous analysis in this area. Representatives of the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, and Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and the city and county child care committees are members of this group which is chaired by the Department of Health. The issue of supports for children with disabilities in mainstream preschool settings is being examined by the subgroup.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	I thank the Minister of State for her response, which included a great deal of information. I acknowledge that this issue is cross-departmental in nature, coming also under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The Minister of State referred to additional funding of â¬4 million that has been allocated in 2014 specifically to drive implementation of the programme on progressing disability services for children and young people. This allocation amounts to the provision of 80 additional therapist posts. My understanding, however, is that this will not facilitate a single child in accessing the early childhood care and education programme. The issue I am raising here is not about assessment of needs. I am referring to a situation where a child who has a specific disability, be it a physical disability or a learning disability, is refused a place by a local child care provider on the basis of that disability. My understanding is that these service providers are paid on a per capita basis. Perhaps the cross-departmental group might consider an arrangement whereby a portion of funding would be held in reserve to accommodate whatever additional resources are required by individual service providers to provide, for example, a special needs assistant for one child or a wheelchair for another. In each individual case, the funding held in reserve could be used to facilitate that child's access. The provision of funding for 80 therapist posts is not the issue. It is about ensuring that when parents approach a local service provider, the latter cannot turn their child away because he or she has a disability. That position would not be countenanced at primary school and it should not be countenanced at preschool. If we are serious about addressing these types of issues, there must be a much faster implementation of the objectives outlined in the national disability strategy for 2016. This particular issue should be resolved by next September.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	Where a place is denied to a child with a disability, the reason usually given is that he or she is not ready for that level of education. This is where the new therapy posts will come in. The reconfiguration I have described is essential and the allocation of â¬4 million was very hard won. It is not about a diagnosis; it is about providing the interventions that are necessary at a very young age, whether speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy or something else, to ensure children gain the very most from a preschool place. In terms of when this will be achieved, the 2016 timeline is essentially a safety net. In 2014, Kerry, Mayo, Galway, north Lee in Cork, Wexford, Kildare and west Wicklow will fully reconfigure their services in line with the new model. Having said that, I very much take on board what the Deputy is saying. There are some providers who simply do not want to take on children who require additional care. The whole idea behind the appointment of additional therapists is to ensure children will be ready to avail of the preschool provision that is available.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	245	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this Topical Issue matter. It is only right and proper that we have an opportunity to discuss such an important issue. I raise it in the context of the survey published by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals which shows a disturbing rise in the number of victims of cyberbullying and the number of pupils who admit to such bullying. As well as the headline figure of a 33% increase in students who report being cyberbullied and an 80% increase in the number of students admitting to cyberbullying another student, the survey found that only one in four parents monitors children's online activity daily, while 15% of parents admit never doing so. These findings copperfasten those of a recent study by DCU which found that 14% of students reported being cyberbullied and 8% admitted carrying out cyberbullying. Clive Byrne, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, has observed that cyberbullying poses a clear and present threat to the collective morale of schools. The NAPDP survey showed, he said, that the less parents monitored their children's online activity, the less they knew about what might be going on. I accept that this is a complex issue, made more complex by the rate of advances in technology, and, as such, is far from simple to tackle. Moreover, responsibility in this area spans several Departments. The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications recently prepared a report on this issue which was discussed at a Friday DÃ¡il sitting some weeks ago and will feed into the work of the Internet content governance advisory group. Many schools are being proactive in this and are doing good work in educating parents on the devastating consequences of cyberbullying. In fact, I received an invitation this morning from the Presentation senior school in Mullingar to attend its information evening. My specific concern today is the role of the Department of Justice and Equality in this matter. Specifically, I am concerned it is not receiving the urgency and priority it deserves. Lives are being lost and this is a time-sensitive issue. Last year, in his 2013 report, the special rapporteur on child protection pointed to a clear deficiency in the legislation to deal with this area. Twelve months later, no action has been taken to implement the clear recommendation of the rapporteur. The simple reality is that the legislation has not kept pace with advances in technology. My Cyberbullying Bill 2013, which I published last year, would create a stand-alone offence of cyberbullying that would apply both to those who engage in the act and those who assist or encourage it. If enacted, this legislation would ensure there are consequences for the bully, not the vulnerable child. As it stands, the perpetrators are getting away with their behaviour. This is about protecting children, not punishing parents. In fact, it is a core protection issue. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider giving time to debate this crucial matter. As I said, it is a time-sensitive issue. Unfortunately, lives are being lost as a direct consequence of cyberbullying.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	246	I am taking this important issue on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality. Cyberbullying is an issue of concern for all of us. Indeed, the Minister is conscious that there has been increased awareness of this issue as well as increased support for those who are the targets of bullying. A wide range of actions are already in place aimed at raising awareness among children and young people, and their parents, of the importance of safer Internet use in general and cyberbullying in particular. One important initiative in this area is the Safer Internet Ireland Project, which is co-ordinated by the Office for Internet Safety, OIS, under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality. Funded by the EU's Safer Internet programme, the project is a consortium of industry, education, child welfare and Government partners which provide safer Internet awareness, hotline and helpline functions in Ireland. The Professional Development Service for Teachers under the auspices of the Department of Education and Skills, ISPCC-Childline, the National Parents Council - Primary, and Hotline.ie operated by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland are all partners in the consortium. The aim of the project is to develop national initiatives promoting safer use of electronic media and enhance protection of the vulnerable, particularly children, against the downside of the Internet, including cyberbullying. The OIS also makes relevant information available, through its website, on linked sites and through its publications, to children and young people and their parents.One of the booklets produced by the OIS focuses specifically on the issue of cyberbullying. In addition, a leaflet entitled Combat Cyberbullying was produced by the OIS for International Safer Internet Day, which took place on 11 February last. Copies of this leaflet in soft and hard copy format are available from the OIS. The OIS also works closely with the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and contributes material for use in the Garda schools programme. The Minister would also like to mention that his colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, has undertaken an extensive awareness-raising programme on bullying, including cyberbullying, for use in schools. As the Deputy knows, bullying, including cyberbullying, may constitute an offence under existing legislation. Harassment is an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act Act 1989 was enacted to prohibit incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation. The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 permits the retention of and access to data for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting serious offences. Cyberbullying may be an offence under any of these Acts. The Minister is aware that the Deputy has proposed legislation on cyberbullying. He would like to thank the Deputy for his interest and work in this area. In November 2013, the Law Reform Commission published its fourth annual programme of law reform. As part of this programme, the commission will examine the topic of cyberbullying as an element of the project on crime affecting personal safety, privacy and reputation including cyberbullying. In view of the existing legislation and of the work of the Law Reform Commission, the Minister does not intend to legislate on cyberbullying at this time. The Minister will, of course, look carefully at the commission's report when it is furnished to him. The Deputy will recall that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, announced at the end of November 2013 that he was setting up the Internet content governance advisory group to consider, among other things, emerging issues in the area of online content and the general impact on the lives of children and young people of bullying and harassment online. The group will take submissions from the public and interested groups. The Minister understands that it is due to report to him in the summer. As part of this process, the Minister will be very interested to hear from Deputies who have a particular interest in this area.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	247	I thank the Minister of State for her reply. In my original contribution, I acknowledged the work being done by the Government and accepted that this is an issue of public health and education. I also said it is a time-sensitive issue because lives are being lost. We cannot afford to wait for advisory groups to come back and report on this, that and the other, especially when we are talking about people's lives. If the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, which was mentioned by the Minister of State, was fit for purpose and was keeping pace with advances in technology, there would have been no need to refer it to the Law Reform Commission. The decision to refer the Act to the commission is an acknowledgement that there is a deficiency and a weakness in it. If the existing legislation is so strong, why are so few criminal prosecutions being brought in respect of cyberbullying, which is now at an epidemic stage? That is just a point I want to make. Education and resources are of great importance in this regard. If we introduce stand-alone legislation that clearly outlines the consequences of this venal and horrendous crime for perpetrators - parents who do not monitor their children must also accept an element of responsibility in this regard - it will act as a clear deterrent for those who might otherwise engage in it. As a result of cyberbullying, some children will be psychologically damaged for a long period. Even worse, some teenagers and young children have taken their own lives on foot of this behaviour. I would like the Minister of State to ask the Minister to consider introducing stand-alone legislation which would act as a clear deterrent by pointing out the clear consequences for those who engage in this awful crime.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	248	I understand perfectly that people can become quite upset when they see horrendous things happening in their communities. I think we have all had that experience. I accept fully that there is a genuine concern in this whole area. The Deputy and I know that when a young person - a ten year old, a 14 year old or a 16 year old - is being bullied online, it usually involves someone else in his or her peer group. I am not certain about what can be done if a 12 year old or a 14 year old is bullying a ten year old. Education is the way forward if young people are to recognise that when they push the button to send something, it might disappear from their screens but that does not necessarily mean it has no consequences for the person who receives it or for the person who sent it. I am not certain about how to deal with that other than by educating young people not to be bullies, regardless of whether that bullying takes place face to face or online. It is a question of education. While I do not share the Deputy's view that there is, as he termed it, an epidemic, in this regard, I agree with him that if one child is damaged as a consequence of this type of action, it is one child too many. Regardless of whether it is my child or someone else's child who is bullied, we know it causes a great deal of upset within a whole circle of people. There are ways of dealing with this activity. If it is not this today, it will be something else tomorrow. It has to be about education. The Deputy is quite right to say that is not just about schools or friends. It is equally about parental responsibility. Most parents are not as au fait with the whole online sphere as their children. I am not. I do not think any of my friends are as up to date on these matters as their children. There is definitely a great deal of work to be done in this area from an educational perspective. We need to point out to people who engage in this activity that their actions have consequences and that those consequences are sometimes fatal for the person who is being bullied.

Basically, the letter informs the council that a democratic decision made by councillors will be overruled. The vote in question relates to the locations and set-back distances for wind turbine developments in the county development plan. The councillors voted that industrial wind turbines should be strictly limited to cut-over or cut-away bogs. They agreed on a set-back distance from occupied dwellings of ten times the height of the turbine. The letter that was sent by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, basically tells the members of the council that the democratic decision they took was not in line with national policy, as set out in the Planning and Development Act. Perhaps I am naive, but I believed this Government's promise of a so-called democratic revolution when it first came to power. So far, it has delivered an all-out attack on local government and local democracy. That has been my experience. I do not need to remind the Minister of State that the wind turbine issue is a very controversial topic, not least in the midlands area. It has been proposed that industrial wind turbines will generate large volumes of energy to be exported to Britain. Sinn FÃ©in will soon introduce legislation to provide for minimum set-back distances for wind turbine development. I ask the Minister of State to take heed of local concerns over wind turbine projects. The local people are better able to identify whether an area is suitable for such developments than somebody sitting in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, who does not know the lie of the land. Local people know local areas best. I am concerned over the letter the Minister of State sent. It looks like the Government is trying to steamroll through these developments without paying heed to local democracy through the votes of those who represent the concerns of local residents. It is not acceptable in a modern democracy. It is not just bad planning policy. It is bad policy, full stop. I ask the Minister of State to change her mind on her decision to block the democratic voices of Westmeath County Council. I believe all parties were represented in this vote. I ask her to respect the wishes of the people of Westmeath and the people of Ireland because it is time for a total rethink of our national energy strategy.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	250	The Deputy raised as a Topical Issue the very general issue of set-back distances. He has now specifically raised an issue in Westmeath. While I will answer the general point, I wish to point out that the directive is a draft directive and not a final directive. As there is an ongoing process with the local authority, I will not comment further on that specific issue at this point. I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue. As he will recall from our previous debate, I commenced a public consultation on 11 December 2013 on proposed draft revisions to the existing 2006 wind energy development guidelines focusing specifically on the issues of noise, set-back and shadow flicker. The draft revisions propose the setting of a more stringent absolute noise limit, day and night, of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments. This limit is an outdoor limit - in general the reduction of noise levels between the outside of a dwelling and inside would be approximately 10 decibels. The draft revisions propose a mandatory set-back distance of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations. The draft revisions propose that a condition be attached to all future planning permissions for wind farms to ensure there will be no shadow flicker at any dwelling within ten rotor diameters of a wind turbine. If shadow flicker does occur, the wind energy developer or operator will be required to take necessary measures, such as turbine shut-down for the period necessary, to eliminate the shadow flicker. It is important to emphasise that the mandatory set-back of 500 m is for amenity considerations, including visual amenity, and is not proposed as a noise control measure. To ensure an evidence-based approach to this issue, Marshall Day Acoustics, which has previously assisted the Australian and New Zealand Governments in their reviews on wind energy, was commissioned to prepare a study on wind noise, which was a significant input into this review. Marshall Day Acoustics recommended that an absolute noise limit be strongly considered as a noise control method rather than set-back. On the issue of set-back, Marshall Day stated:The relationship between distance from a wind turbine or wind farm and noise effects is significant, and there is little means of future proofing when specifying minimum set back distances. In this respect, setbacks therefore have the potential to either over-protect or under-protect wind farm neighbours. It is therefore recommended that setbacks are not used as a control method [on their own].Therefore, on the basis of the technical advice received, the draft guidelines address the issue of noise control through a more stringent absolute noise limit, day and night, of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments, combined with a minimum set-back distance requirement of 500 m for amenity considerations, including visual amenity. The proposed noise limit takes into account both the World Health Organization findings on night-time noise and the review of international practice undertaken by Marshall Day Acoustics. More than 7,000 submissions have been received in my Department on the draft revisions to the wind energy development guidelines during the public consultation phase, a substantial number of which were on the issue of set-back distances, and I will certainly give these views careful consideration prior to finalising the revisions to the guidelines.

The first element is the planning guidelines and legislation for the wind turbines. The second element is the wider planning and critical infrastructure policy, procedures and legislation. The third element is the Government's view of what local government and local governance should mean. The Minister of State has said this was a draft directive and that she will not comment on it. That is like the HSE west-north west hospital group suggesting it is only a proposal to remove maternity services from Sligo General Hospital and that a decision has not been made. It is like saying the Environmental Protection Agency is considering only hydraulic fracturing and that a decision had not been made. They are both considering something that should not happen anyway. It would be the express opinion of the people in the affected areas that these things should not happen and should not be even discussed. It is foolish to process wind farm planning applications when the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has indicated that he will shortly publish a Green Paper on energy and when we have been told that no financial arrangements have been discussed with the British Government for our midlands being used as a giant British offshore wind energy farm. Similarly, elected members of Leitrim County Council, representing Fianna FÃ¡il, Fine Gael, Sinn FÃ©in and Independent, voted by a large majority to have fracking banned in the county development plan, yet the EPA is spending its time and taxpayers' money on continuing research into something that anybody, who cares for the next generation, would know should not be allowed under any circumstances or any regulatory regime. This is not reform of local government and whatever it is, it is not democracy.

The draft guidelines I have proposed are from the Deputy's perspective an improvement. Existing guidelines call for a 500 m set-back, but it is not mandatory. I am proposing that it would be mandatory. They also provide for an improvement with regard to noise and the eradication of shadow flicker. These draft guidelines would improve the existing situation. I cannot say what will be in the final guidelines. I have received 7,000 submissions by last Friday's closing date. I expect we will be able to publish the final version of the guidelines by the end of June. It is not true to say that if I were not doing this, things somehow would be better. In fact what we are proposing represents an improvement from the perspective of local people. On the Deputy's point about democracy, I remind him about the Mahon tribunal. Some local authorities made planning decisions that gave rise to a tribunal of inquiry resulting in a recommendation for a planning regulator. We need to have planning policy side by side with local democracy. We need national guidelines to guide decisions made locally. Nobody would want us not to have any national guidelines. For example, I issued a directive to a local authority that wanted to change its county development plan to allow for building on a flood plain. I believe I was right to do that. We need balance between national policy, good planning and local democracy. I am quite happy to stand over that balance. In this case we need a balance between national policy on reducing our dependence on fossil fuels through using the natural energy we have and the needs of local communities. That is what I intend to ensure when we publish the final guidelines on wind energy.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	I, together with my colleague, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter and I acknowledge the presence of Deputy AodhÃ¡n Ã RÃ­ordÃ¡in. My position is simple. I thank the Minister of State for attending on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar. I would like the Minister, given the State's share in Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority, to request that the company and the trustees of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, include deferred members, that is, those who have retired but are not yet in receipt of their pensions, in any further negotiations towards resolving the pension deficit concerns. We understand negotiations are at an advanced stage but decisions are being made which are affecting the approximately 3,900 deferred members and they have had no input into the process. They feel their interests are not being represented in the process. Many of these deferred members were actively encouraged to take early retirement by management as recently as last year. According to people to whom I have spoken and who have contacted me, they are facing a potential cut of 50% to 60% in their pension benefits as a result of proposals currently on the table. This is a massive cut for people. It must also be noted that it was compulsory for these members to pay into the superannuation scheme in the first place. It is also worth noting that many of these workers were then encouraged to take early retirement. Will the Minister intervene and work with all the stakeholders involved to ensure the voice of the deferred members is heard? There is a basic issue of fairness at stake which needs to be addressed.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter along with Deputy Ryan. No one wants to see a strike in Dublin Airport or in Shannon or Cork. I hope the pensions dispute can be resolved by agreement as otherwise it would greatly affect the tourism industry. I discussed this matter today with Deputy Ã RÃ­ordÃ¡in and we were looking at the figures. When one takes into consideration Aer Lingus, the Dublin Airport Authority and others, approximately 5,800 people will be affected by this, and in that sense I mean deferred members. Those with deferred pensions, as a result of cost-cutting and restructuring within the company, took redundancy and, by doing so, have helped the company return to profitability. Members who have left employment but are not yet on pension have no power. They have no representation. They cannot close the airport and are facing a much reduced pension entitlement. I am not asking for special treatment but for fairness for the former workers. The deferred members have no access to the industrial relations mechanisms of the State. They have been frozen out. Will the Minister of State take this matter up with his colleagues to ensure that, in the interests of fairness, the interests of those members are protected?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	I thank the two Deputies for raising this important issue. I should make it clear that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has no function in regard to the administration of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS. The resolution of the funding difficulties in the IASS is primarily a matter for the trustees, the members of the scheme, the companies participating in the scheme and the regulator for such pension schemes, which is the Pensions Board. There are many features of the IASS scheme that make it quite distinctive. One is the fact that the scheme has a very high proportion of deferred and pensioned members compared with active members. Only the active members and their employers are still paying contributions into the scheme. Both Deputies have raised the issue of representation of deferred and pensioner members. It should be pointed out that the trustees of the scheme, who are central to any solution of the funding difficulties, are required by law to act in the best interests of all the members. On that basis the trustees have to take account of the interests of the deferred and pensioner members in any proposals they make. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for labour and industrial relations policy and the Department of Social Protection is responsible for pension policy. Pension related matters are increasingly arising in industrial relations disputes, and the issue of how pensioners and deferred members are represented in the negotiations around such disputes is an issue. I am aware that this is a matter that is under active discussion between the two Departments concerned. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has stated recently that it is actively considering issues in relation to the provision of access to former employees, including retired workers, to the industrial relations machinery of the State under the Industrial Relations Acts. Another particular feature of the IASS is the fact that it is a multi-employer scheme involving the Dublin Airport Authority, Aer Lingus, the Shannon Airport Authority and SR Technics. There are around 14,800 members in the scheme, which is now closed to new members. It is estimated that Aer Lingus membership constitutes around 69% of the total, with DAA-SAA representing 26% and the former SRT workers representing 5%. The scheme currently has a substantial and unsustainable deficit and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has encouraged the parties to continue to use the State's labour relations machinery to resolve the difficulties. The parties participated in extensive discussions with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court to identify solutions. In May of last year, the Labour Court issued recommendations on the matter, including separate recommendations in regard to Aer Lingus and the DAA. A range of meetings involving the parties have taken place since then. The first step in the process of implementing a solution to the funding difficulties is for the trustees of the scheme to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board, as required under the Pension Acts. The trustees announced on 14 February last that they have decided in principle on a number of changes to address the funding difficulties. I welcome this first step as I believe this will assist the parties to refocus on workable solutions to the funding problems in the scheme. The proposed measures include a number of cuts to current and future pension benefits, which would affect all categories of scheme members, including active members, deferred pensioners and pensioners. In their letter to the employers and the unions, the trustees formally requested the employers and the unions to give appropriate consideration to the position of the deferred members in further discussions. The problems with this scheme have been well recognised for many years and must be resolved. This is in the interests of all members of the scheme. Now that the trustees have issued their proposals, I would urge all parties to engage again, utilising the State's labour relations machinery where necessary. Any industrial action would not help such a process but rather inconvenience passengers and damage the financial position of the companies, which will ultimately, along with the scheme members, have to contribute to the resolution to the problems of the scheme.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	I thank the Minister of State for his response. I welcome that he said that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is actively considering issues in regard to the provision of access to former employees generally. However, this will take some time in terms of changes to the law and it will not benefit the workers in Aer Lingus at this time. I ask that the Minister would use the influence that comes with being a considerable stakeholder in the companies to request that the deferred members would be included in the process. The recent vote from SIPTU workers for industrial action over this issue highlights the need for further and more intensive negotiations. The Minister of State can understand the frustration of the deferred members, who number such a high proportion of the overall members, having to sit back, not being involved in the process and not having a voice.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	257	Sure.

#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	259	I thank the Minister of State for his response. I point out that the deferred pensioners cannot utilise the labour relations machinery of the State, where necessary, nor can they go on strike. They are very much powerless and without a voice. Many of them are facing up to a 50% reduction in their pension benefits. Aer Lingus has said it will hold an extraordinary general meeting to seek approval for a once-off contribution of â¬140 million, if agreed.It stressed that those contributions will not be made without shareholders' approval. What way will the Minister vote with the State's 25% shareholding? Will he ensure the interests of the deferred pensioners are protected? Those workers who retired early were convinced to do so on the assurance of their future pensions and, by doing so, they have helped the airline to return to profitability. Are they now to be thrown under the bus?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	First, as I pointed out, the Minister has no function in regard to the administration of the scheme. However, I accept what both Deputies have said and I accept the point about the frustration of the members, especially those who have paid into the scheme. People want to know what their pension rights will be when the time comes to draw their pensions. I want to put on the record that the trustees must represent all sections, and they cannot just represent one part of this. That is the legislation and, under law, they have to do that. I would hope that, with the new proposals, the trustees can use the mechanisms of State to try to resolve this problem. There is a massive deficit of â¬760 million that has to be dealt with. In March, we are coming to the kick-off of the tourist season. It would be in no one's interest, neither the country's, the company's nor the members', to have a strike. I hope all sides can try to resolve this very serious situation in the best interests of the country and particularly of the members.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	I welcome the opportunity to speak. We will be supporting the Bill. It was included in a health information Bill when the heads of that Bill were approved by the Government in 2009. This was clearly an issue that was discussed in the context of the troika to ensure health identifiers were put on a statutory basis. For that reason, we feel it is an appropriate Bill. In general, when one considers the need to ensure proper transparency and accountability in terms of identification throughout the health process, this is clearly a step in the right direction. There are some issues of concern which the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, might consider. Given the health information Bill is imminent, I received an e-mail from some people who are concerned, and I said I would quote it. The Minister of State can take it as a statement of views, rather than a point of dispute. The e-mail reads:The Health Information Bill is imminent and Electronic Patient Records are being devised. Summary discharge records etc are already being devised by the HSE. Despite several expert papers showing how patient data can be compromised because of lack of privacy enhanced technology, we are the only country not discussing this in the public domain. Medical Confidentiality as we know it will be gone. The Unique Health Identifier proposed will be linked to personal information which will be available to all HSE staff and researchers. These include medical researchers, epidemiologists, insurance personnel and companies such as Google. This is against Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. We may be told that the data will be anonymised. Dr Latanya Sweeney from Harvard University has proven in 2000, that date of birth, gender and zipcode can re-identify the medical records of about 90% of the American population. These "researchers" will have access to these centralized medical records and facilitated by the unique identifier without an opt in or so far without even an opt out (which is illegal under European law) and because we have no HIPAA law or Anonymised code these personal records, including psychiatric, and reproductive records will easily be re-identified. The NHS in the UK are presently selling patient records to Google. They are uploading GP records without consent, and selling them internationally.As I said, that is from an e-mail I received from some very eminent people, who asked me to bring it to the Minister of State's attention, as I have done. On the broader issue, as I said, we welcome the fact this Bill is being brought forward. We will be discussing e-medicine and the need for us to avail of technology in the whole area of diagnostics and the delivery of care in the community, for example. Anything that ensures a smooth transition of information and records is welcome. On the broader issue, while the Government has published a paper on e-medicine, I believe we should be more adventurous in how we go about developing e-medicine and e-care in communities. There has to be a seamless transition of information and monitoring of patient flow through the medical system from the GP to primary care, to referral to hospital, both with regard to the inpatient and the outpatient, right through to step-down facilities and back to home care and supports in the home. This issue is an important component of trying to deliver that care in the years ahead. The software and technology to deliver e-medicine exists and should be availed of. It is very expensive to keep people in a hospital setting and we have difficulties in trying to transfer people from the acute hospital system into step-down care, into the community and back to their homes with supports. It is an issue we all agree needs to be progressed, primarily for the patient but also for the delivery of care itself, as it is more expensive to keep people in hospital. I know there is a certain roll-out in terms of home care packages and traditional home helps. However, we have to go beyond that in embracing other forms of technology. We need the software packages and infrastructure placed in the home in order that the public health nurse, or others who are employed or contracted by the HSE, such as GPs and so on, would be able to monitor a patient in the home, feed that information back to a centralised system and inform the system of what medications have been administered, blood pressure, diagnostics and all that goes with that. This centralised system would allow a monitoring of the information by clinicians or qualified nurse specialists who would be able to look at the patient's vital signs and know whether medication has been administered in time, and whether the person is improving or needs further assistance. If there are concerns, a clinician can be consulted, and if a callout is required, that will happen. I believe this is something we have to embrace. I come in here and criticise the Government, which is my role, and I also come forward with proposals, from time to time. While they are never read, they are there all the same.

The idea of having people in the acute hospital setting for longer periods than they should be makes no economic sense and is certainly not good patient practice in terms of communicable diseases and other problems associated with people in high-density acute hospital settings. In a previous life, when I was involved in trade a number of years ago, there was an amazing number of companies developing software packages for the monitoring of patients through the system and back into the home care setting.I believe there is a strong need to embrace that issue. I know the Government has published a paper on it, which I have read, but we need to go beyond that and ensure we have a meaningful virtual hospital in the community, if the Minister of State understands what I am trying to say. This is a requirement as well. We must ensure we have proper health identifiers in it so that one has guaranteed access to patient information and it is concise and clear. When one talks about health identifiers, data protection and individuals' details being placed with other people, there is always concern that it can lead to people accessing information for other reasons or ulterior motives. This is why I said I would raise the issue regarding Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In general, this Bill is a positive step and we will be supporting it. Generally speaking, the advances in information technology coupled with advances in medicine are key areas we should explore and exploit. Remote diagnostics is one area towards which we are moving. When we talk about reconfiguring hospitals, which is always a contentious issue, rather than just diminishing services in a community, we need to complement services in hospitals by using remote diagnostics in a proper structured way. A radiographer and others could do the X-rays and CT scans and people could be diagnosed elsewhere. A group of clinicians with competence and expertise would be able centrally to look at these X-rays or scans remotely and make an informed decision. We are looking at this area but much more could be done. I urge the Minister of State to look at that issue again. The question of how we come up with imaginative solutions to providing and complementing services rather than just using reconfiguration as a means to reduce services is the key issue in terms of e-health over the next few years. That is why people are very wary when the Minister of State raises issues regarding reconfiguration and assessing capacity in our health system. The perception is that
the quid pro quo is normally a reduction in services. We have had that case in the context of the reconfiguration in the mid-west with regard to Nenagh, Ennis and Dooradoyle in Limerick. There was meant to have been a transfer out of Dooradoyle to Ennis and Nenagh, but that has not happened with the speed with which it should have happened to give people confidence that while they will sacrifice one service, another meaningful one will be provided in their community not just for the sake of putting a service into the community but to complement the overall health service. The Health Information and Quality Authority today pointed out that many common causes of adverse events such as incorrect administration of medicines or transfusion of the wrong blood into a patient can be due to poor patient identification processes, basic human error, incorrect filing or a failure in communication. That is something that has caused major difficulties in previous times, and we have had inquiries and tribunals in that context from time to time. Certainly, this Bill is a step forward in that context. It is about efficiency and traceability, ensuring proper procedures are in place and being able quickly to identify a breakdown in those procedures. The Bill in general has looked at those key areas to ensure this does not happen and that if it does happen, it can be rectified very quickly. In his two hats as Minister of State and barrister, the Minister of State might refer to some of the issues raised in the context of concerns e-mailed to me by some people who raised the issue that because of the glut of information available, there could be some way of identifying individuals through the system. That would be a very worrying development. Last year, the Government published the e-health strategy and eHealth Ireland will be established to implement it. A new IT system for the health system as a whole will be published in early 2014 by eHealth Ireland. Priority projects for eHealth Ireland include a national health identifier infrastructure, e-prescribing systems, online referrals and scheduling, tele-health care, development of patient summary records, online access to health information and a national patient portal. It is a seven year strategy that is divided into two phases - years one to four and years five to seven. One of the aims for the first four years is patients being able to access their own health records, which is clearly a very important issue. I do not expect the State to roll over easily when people consider that harm is being done to them by it. Obviously, the State has an obligation to protect itself and the integrity of the institutions under it. However, at times when there is obvious liability, we see situations where people who have been damaged by the State or State institutions must go to extraordinary lengths not only to vindicate their good name but just to get access to records. That is an area where we must be conscious of the need to be open and transparent in ensuring people can access information about themselves. For example, there were issues in Portlaoise regarding information that was sought not being made available with regard to the very tragic cases in the maternity hospital there in recent times. That in itself feeds suspicion and undermines people's confidence in our health services. When we have proper records and details whereby one can trace all procedures for an individual right through the health system because of this and other legislation, the records should be opened up and made freely available rather than making people go to extraordinary lengths to access them. I have tabled some parliamentary questions on Dignity 4 Patients in Drogheda. The State is involved in taking on the Information Commissioner because of his findings that the information should have been made available. I am not blaming the Minister of State personally. Obviously, he takes advice from the legal apparatus available to Government, but at the same time, it leaves people with a sense of distaste that organs of the State are acting aggressively as if they are trying to prevent information from flowing to citizens. As we all know, openness, making as much information as possible available and allowing individuals to vindicate their rights if they have been damaged in some way are healthy in the context of a broader democracy and individuals' rights. That is an aside but it is a critical component. The quid pro quo is that if the State is entitled to gather as much information about people as possible, it should equally be obliged to release as much information as possible to those individuals when they request it. It is fair. With responsibilities come rights, but it works the other way as well. That is something I urge the Minister of State to look at in terms of the broader policy of making information available. The cases at the maternity unit in the Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise were very tragic and we know a review is being carried out. Families have been very hurt and damaged by the tragic loss of life, but there was also the issue of how it was handled. I do not want to prejudge anybody or point fingers at any individuals but having met with some of the people involved, their major concern after the tragic events was the way they were handled in terms of information flow. Trying to gather records and seek information was almost impossible. That does not augur well for openness and people being able to find out what went wrong and to right that wrong as best they can in terms of reaching conclusions. Turning again to the e-strategy as part of the broader health strategy in the years ahead, the Digital Hub and software conferences that are continually held in Ireland display the world's most dynamic companies. They provide wonderful quality products, software designs, etc. The State should embrace them more by using their cutting edge technologies, which they export all over the world from Ireland. Although some of those companies export their products for use in government agencies and departments, it used to be the case that we did not engage with them as efficiently and effectively as we should have. One would like to believe that a company has been supplying the Department of Health or so on with a product, but we often find that the opposite is the case and the company has been convincing other countries to embrace their products before relaying that information back. This is not a criticism of any Irish Government, but we should be more proactive in considering what is in Ireland. The areas of e-health and e-medicine are clearly ones in which we have an advantage over other countries, given what companies in this country have developed. By and large, I welcome the Bill. A commitment was given to the troika to publish legislation on health identifiers. Obviously, it is not one of the conditions the current Government renegotiated, but there was no need to anyway, as it is a positive step. We support the broad thrust of the Bill and look forward to some of the discussions that may be held on Committee Stage. Could I get further information on the questions of information, the dissemination of same and medical confidentiality? These are issues of concern, but if they could be alleviated, even through a statement as opposed to an addition, that would be fine by me, but when one sees a state that is gathering information afraid for whatever reason to disseminate that information, it leads to suspicions of Big Brother watching and being in control. It undermines what is being done to a certain extent.

It is a very long overdue and necessary development to improve the delivery of health services. The allocation of an individual number or unique identifier to each individual for the purpose of health services has been talked about for a very long time. At least now we are finally seeing progress, which is welcome. It is a pity this development is not coming in the context of real and comprehensive overall reform of our health services, but the fact is this Government's health reform programme - the Minister of State may not recognise or accept what I am about to say - now appears to be in a shambles. The past fortnight has been dominated by the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, scandal, with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, at its epicentre. This has diverted attention from a situation that is also extremely serious and in which two Ministers are embroiled. The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, are at loggerheads in respect of the draft White Paper on universal health insurance. Like the GSOC scandal, leaks have played a central role in this row. In this case, we have two Ministers leaking and spinning against each other. It has become a war of leaks and spin. We have the extraordinary sight of one Minister, the Minister of State's party colleague, Deputy Howlin, accusing another Minister, Deputy Reilly, of proposing a plan that would pose a risk to the State's financial stability. Universal health insurance is supposed to be a cornerstone of this Government's policy and the White Paper was promised early in its term. The last promised publication date was 2013, but we still have not seen it. I repeat: we still have not seen it. The contents of the White Paper have been extensively leaked to sections of the media while Oireachtas Members and the public at large are left in the dark, all but for the little snippets that make their way into, by and large, the pages of the print media. Our health services are in crisis and plans for their future must be fully and openly debated, not the subject of a dog fight between rival Ministers. The Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition's concept of universal health insurance based on competing private health insurance companies is one that we in Sinn FÃ©in have criticised as fundamentally flawed. We have also criticised the lack of detail about the coalition's plan and have been vindicated in that respect. I am surprised, though perhaps after three years of this coalition I should not be. It still puzzles me that the Labour Party would be a party to a proposal to develop universal health care based on, as I have said, competing private health insurance companies. I find it bizarre and I do not believe that all the party's number are enthusiasts for it. They could not be. Arising from this row that I have described, we had the speculation last week on the part of the Minister of State, Deputy White's good self that the promised free general practitioner, GP, care for all would not be free at all, in that a fee might apply. I believe the Minister of State is sincere in his wish to see free GP care introduced, but his comments raise the question, and perhaps he would like to take the opportunity in responding at the end of Second Stage to clarify-----

That is my question. It certainly has suggested to me at least a lack of clarity and lack of coherence in this coalition's approach to health care. The White Paper on universal health insurance should be published immediately. I wonder whether the Minister of State has anything to tell us in that regard, given that it was before the sub-committee yesterday and, I would expect, perhaps before Cabinet today, but I could be wrong in that regard. I again ask that the Minister of State use his good offices with his senior Minister to ensure it is published and that everyone can judge its merits for himself or herself. We can then commence a real debate focused on the facts of the document's content and on the needs of health service users as we each individually believe.

At the moment, what we have is, as I have described, an internal row within this coalition Government, with the people and the people's representatives in these Houses of the Oireachtas excluded. That is unacceptable.As I said in the context of another health Bill recently, the Bill before us today may be part of a bigger picture, but I have yet to see that picture. I have to judge it on its own merits, not as part of a process or a package of measures that will result in a reformed health system. The Bill provides for what I believe is a positive and useful development in our health services. Most of us have had the experience of the difficulties caused by the disconnection between the different elements of our health services. There is little coÂ­ordination between the records of patients kept by GPs and other providers of primary care, including the HSE, and between them and acute hospitals and other providers at secondary and tertiary levels. Even within hospitals, there are often difficulties because of the absence of a single patient number for each patient. Many of us have experienced the repeated filling out of forms with basic patient information even during the course of one hospital visit and even when the hospital already has our records. The purpose of the Bill is to assign a unique number - the individual health identifier - to each individual to whom a health service is being, has been or may be provided. The focus needs to be kept on that simple and straightforward aim. We need to ensure that maximum benefit from this change is assured for all users of our health services and for health service providers. That said, we need to put this major change in place very carefully to protect people's personal data and to prevent abuse of what will be a very important and valuable database on our population. We have seen in recent years how certain state agencies - notably US agencies - have grossly abused people's right to have their personal data protected. The current controversy in this State regarding surveillance provides another reminder of the need for robust data protection. The introduction of the individual health identifier will require wide public consultation and information to ensure it can work effectively and that all necessary safeguards are put in place. I strongly urge the Minister to ensure this is done and that people are informed in a clear and coherent manner about this new development in our health system. I also urge the Minister to ensure constructive suggestions and contributions, both by way of amendments to the Bill from Members and by way of relevant comment in the public domain, are taken on board. Too often it has been the experience of the Opposition that little attention is paid to important observations and to key amendments. This Bill will require careful scrutiny on Committee Stage. I wish to notify my intention to object to section 5(3) which reads: "The assigning of an individual health identifier shall not be regarded in any way as indicating, in and of itself, an entitlement to, or eligibility for, the provision of a health service to the individual." I can understand some of the arguments for the inclusion of such a provision in the Bill. However, the reality is that while this provision states that the individual health identifier shall not be regarded as indicating entitlement to health services, there is a consequential lack of clarity in the overall body of health legislation about exactly what health services people are entitled to. We just do not know. The allocation of an identifier number for each of us does not of itself underscore entitlement, according to this section of the Bill. I think it is offensive for that very reason. The Minister will recall that in the previous DÃ¡il - I think it even went further back than that - the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill was repeatedly promised year after year, but it never appeared. The current Minister and I probably competed at various stages to pose the question to a former Taoiseach and the Minister for Health of the day on the progress of that Bill. We all know what happened to that Bill. It was allowed to fall off the promised legislative list, yet its importance was clear in its stated intent. The Bill was supposed to clarify and update current provisions relating to eligibility for health and personal social services. That was and is a very important Bill. That affirmation of our right and entitlement to specified health services and personal social services should have been progressed in legislation. I again ask the Minister of State to re-examine all that and inform himself as to why it was allowed to fall off the table, so to speak. This brings me back to my opening points on the Government's health programme now being in a shambles. One would expect that legislation along the lines of the Bill that never saw the light of day might form part of the Government's reform programme. It does not. I contend that it should and I ask that the Minister of State enlighten us on the conclusion of Second Stage. In the absence of explicit legislation setting out what people are entitled to, we are all in limbo with great uncertainty. I hope he accepts the arguments I have made for why I will oppose section 5(3) of the Bill when we get the opportunity on Committee Stage and Report Stage, if it still survives at that point. I urge the deletion of section 5(3), but I record my support for the passage of the Bill.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	271	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I also welcome the debate, as we all want to see a modern, efficient and safe health service. That is the bottom line. We need to get on with the reform agenda, as many of us promised during the previous general election.Professionalism and accountability are also required to ensure all patients are safe and their rights and files are protected and guarded. In recent weeks, health has been the subject of many Bills and debates in the House. It is time to move on and take immediate action. Delays are not an option as reform of the health service is essential. The faults and weaknesses in the sector must be faced and addressed. The time for talking is over. I welcome and support the legislation as it has many positive features.  It is important to closely examine the Bill. It seeks to introduce systems of health identifiers for individuals, patients and clients of health care providers and for health care professionals and organisations and their employees and agents. Separate registers will be created for individual and provider identifiers. Access to the individual identifiers register will be strictly limited and unauthorised access will be considered an offence. This is an important provision as it is relevant to some of the comments we have heard.  We must go further by developing new and radical ideas for the health service. We must listen to health professionals and front-line staff who have daily experience of the problems in the health service. The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has stated that the absence of a unique health identifier for individuals is the single most important deficiency in the health information infrastructure. The Bill provides for the assignment of two new systems of health identifiers, namely, individual health identifiers for patients and service users and health service provider identifiers for health professionals and organisations and their employees and agencies. In keeping with the HIQA recommendations, the new system and numbers will be exclusive to health care, which is broadly understood to mean the public and private health sectors. The individual health identifier system will contain identifier numbers only and will not include any personal or clinical data. They are, however, underpinned by an identifier data set designed for the purpose of helping to ensure unique identification. The Bill will also establish national registers for the identifier numbers and a related governance framework. These measures will deliver greater efficiency and modernisation in the health service and will, I hope, result in better patient care.  In 2008, the Department of Health and Children, as it was known at the time, carried out a consultation on this issue and found a broad consensus in favour of the introduction of unique health identifiers for individuals and health care providers. The consultation also highlighted differences of opinion on the approach to be taken, with some stakeholders supporting the use of personal public service numbers, PPS, in the health sector, as was recommended by the health information strategy in 2004. This approach was rejected owing to limitations in the PPS system and concerns about privacy, among other reasons. A survey of public opinion also found a high degree of public support for the use of health identifiers and the making of health records available across health care settings. The survey also found that people were concerned about their health information, although a large majority indicated they trusted medical institutions with their data. The question that arises is whether the position has changed since the survey was carried out. It is important to answer this question because it is vital that people trust the health service. Professionalism and care in the health service are also important. Confidence and trust in the health service have been damaged in recent years. We must face this issue and the issue of competence.  Many Deputies appear to believe that the problem of people waiting on trolleys in our hospitals has gone away. This is still a major crisis and the Minister must be brave when nurses and other professionals on the front line in our accident and emergency units tell us that the number of beds in hospitals is a problem. He must ensure a sufficient number of beds is provided.  HIQA states that it is difficult to separate out the benefits of implementing individual health identifiers from e-health projects that would make use of the identifiers. It notes the benefits include improved patient safety and quality of care, the streamlining of records management, a reduction in repetitive and unnecessary care and reduced administration costs. HIQA also notes the benefits that can be derived from health care practitioner and organisation identifiers. These identifiers enhance the quality and safety of patient care, reduce the possibility of administrative and clinical errors, reduce duplication, enhance communications between health care practitioners and organisations and accelerate care pathways for patients. The ability of health identifiers to enhance quality and safety in patient care will be a positive development and it is one for which all of us have called for many years. It also forms part of the reform agenda.  On regulations, while the Bill contains details on the establishment and maintenance of registers, it does not provide detailed information on every operational aspect of the legislation. Section 3 gives the Minister the power to make regulations to provide for any matter referred to in the Bill. The regulations may contain any incidental supplementary and consequential provisions which the Minister considers to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of the regulations. However, some regulations can be made only when they are in the public interest. Section 3(3) provides that a person or class of persons cannot be prescribed as an authorised disclosee except where the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. These are important issues to be teased out in the debate. The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, stated that individual health identifiers "are about patient safety and ensuring that the right information is associated with the right individual at the point of care." If the Government delivers on this, I will be strongly supportive of the measure. Individual health identifiers will, the Minister added, "help in managing the health service more efficiently and will be a building block for health reform initiatives outlined in Future Health, including Money Follows the Patient". This, too, is important because we must ensure the patient is always placed at the top of the agenda. We have seen the faults, mistakes and weaknesses in the health service. Structural and administrative weaknesses must be eliminated through legislation and competent management. Human error is inevitable in the health service and we all have experience of cases that were extremely upsetting for patients and their families.  Section 21, which relates to offences relating to the assignment of individual health identifiers, states:(1) A person shall be guilty of an offence if, for the purposes of the assigning of an individual health identifier to him or her or to another personâ(a) he or she makes a statement or representation, whether orally or in writing, that is false or misleading in a material particular, knowing the statement or representation, as the case may be, to be so false or misleading or being reckless as to whether it is so false or misleading, (b) he or she conceals a material fact, or(c) he or she gives, or causes or knowingly allows to be given, any information, in purported compliance with a provision of this Act, that is false or misleading in a material particular, knowing the information to be so false or misleading or being reckless as to whether it is so false or misleading. (2) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) shall be liableâ(a) on summary conviction, to a class B fine, or(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding â¬100,000. It is important we are seen to be tough. I urge the Government and the Minister to be careful in the protection of people's personal data. We have seen examples of abuse in this regard in the past. Data protection is essential. As legislators, we have a duty to bring the public with us. The only way to do so is to ensure confidence and trust in the health service. It is important, therefore, that any proposed amendments are given careful consideration and, if sensible, supported.  The e-health strategy highlights that Ireland's spend on ICT in health care, at 0.85% of the total health care budget in comparison with the EU average of 2% to 3%, is low by international standards. It also states that developments will be funded through a realignment of the national health care budget as well as an increased investment in e-health systems and changed management, process re-engineering and implementation support infrastructure. I again emphasise that with reform must come investment. In general, there is a recognised technology deficit in the public service, with continued constraints over many years resulting in a maintenance-only approach to ICT spend. This must be taken into account in the context of this legislation. Overall, e-health strategies seek to save money. The Health Information and Quality Authority estimates that current spend in respect of patient records is 30% of total budget, which is positive. The Bill provides for: the Minister to assign an Individual Health Identifier, (IHI) â a unique number â to an individual to whom a health service is being, has been or may be provided, the Minister to assign a Health Services Provider Identifier â a unique number â to a person (a natural person or a legal person) who provides a health service,the Minister to establish and maintain National Registers in respect of the IHI and Health Services Provider Identifiers which will contain the identifiers and other identifying particulars of those to whom the numbers are assigned,the association of the identifiers with medical records and related communications,the basis on which the IHI Register and the Provider Identifier may be accessed,the basis on which the information in the IHI Register may be processed and by whom,andrelated matters including offences, complaints and the consequential amendment of other enactments.  I welcome this debate and the legislation, although as stated I have concerns about particular sections. We all want a modern, efficient and quality health service that delivers for patients. Staff in our health services are magnificent, be they people who work with children and adults with intellectual disabilities, on the front-line or who work with people who have cystic fibrosis or cancer. Our staff are excellent but they need resources and structural change to assist them. We have a long way to go but if the reforms and changes are good for patients and there is sensible and efficient use of resources, the Minister will have my support.

The Bill provides for assignment of two systems of health identifiers, namely, individual health identifiers, IHIs, for patients-service users and health service identifiers for health professionals and organisations, their employees and agents. In keeping with HIQA recommendations, the new system of numbers will be exclusive to health care, broadly understood and be used in the public and private sector. The individual health identifiers will be made up of numbers only and contain no personal or clinical data. However, they will be underpinned by an identifier data set designed for the purpose of ensuring unique identification. The Bill also establishes national registers for these numbers and data sets and a related governance framework. The principal reason for the introduction of identifiers is to improve the quality and safety of care, in particular through correct patient identification. Other anticipated benefits include streamlining of record management, a reduction in repetitive and unnecessary care, facilitating e-health projects and reduced administration costs. HIQA estimates that up to 30% of the health budget may be spent on handling, collecting, searching for and storing information. Many of the benefits of introducing this scheme arise from its application in information and communication technology, ICT, improvements in the sector, known as, e-health initiatives or strategies. E-prescribing is a priority e-health project promoted by the troika and thought to have the potential to reduce public spend on drugs. The health service provider identifier will allow all episodes of care to be traced to the provider, including the organisation and professional involved. Professionals will be assigned a unique number which will move with them if they change job or location, allowing for greater traceability. The regulatory body for the professions will provide the data necessary to populate the register. An individual health identifier is a unique, non-transferable, life-time number assigned to all individuals accessing health and social care in Ireland. Its purpose is to accurately identify the individual enabling health and social care to be delivered to the right patient in the right place at the right time. A health service provider identifier is a unique, non-transferable, life-time number assigned by the Minister to a person who provides a health service. Its purpose is to identify the individual as one and the same person and to allow attachment to them of other information such as name, address, contact details. A health care organisation identifier is a unique, non-transferable number assigned to health care organisations in Ireland. It will allow for attachment to a database of their identity, contact details and operational sites. Currently, there are no national systems in Ireland for patient identifiers and provider identification in health care is not universal, in that some professions can be traced back to their professional registers while for others no register exists. Health information is held in multiple disparate health information systems, including GP practices, hospitals and so on, with each having its own system, either paper based or electronic. Related to the lack of a common identification system for individuals is the absence of adequate information technology which the Department of Health has said means patient records cannot be accessed in a timely fashion and, therefore, points of medical contact become islands of information increasing the risk for patients.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	274	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Health Identifiers Bill 2013. We all appreciate that in the past few decades, and with an increasing intensity, technology has revolutionised the way we live and work. Some sectors have been able to adapt and harness the opportunities much more readily than others, a prime example being the difference between new private sector companies and the older more established entities such as Departments. There is a need for some level of "bureaucracy", a word which has long since lost its intended meaning, namely, to confer a formal hierarchical organisation with many levels on which tasks, responsibilities and authority are delegated among individuals, offices and Departments. The word has evolved. It now has a negative connotation and is used to indicate red tape and excessive routine. Any system, however, requires planning, organising, transparency and clearly developed procedures to ensure the proper delivery of services. In many instances this has occurred in a way which has not put technology to best use and has, therefore, resulted in higher levels of spending on processes and systems at a time when resources are stretched. For example, it is only recently that contacting the Department of Social Protection by e-mail has been possible. Similarly, it is less than five years since one has been able to apply for social welfare schemes online and even then the service is restricted to a small number of schemes. Other examples include the relative infancy of the public services card and the integrated travel card or leap card. All in all, it seems to take an inordinate amount of time with significant resources to utilise technology in the provision of services in our country. From a different perspective the Health Identifiers Bill is significant in respect of the absolute necessity for every patient in the health system to have a unique identification. The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has emphasised that first and foremost individual health identifiers are about patient safety and ensuring that the right information is associated with the right individual at the point of care. This should be of paramount importance in any system but especially given the reforms under way in the health service. One such reform is the establishment of the new hospital groups, a measure trialled successfully in my area of the west with the Galway Roscommon hospital group. The use of technology, underpinned by health identifiers, will be essential in hospital groups since each hospital will carry out different treatments and procedures. For example, a patient might undergo tests and scans in a hospital in Roscommon but undergo surgery in University Hospital Galway. It is not difficult to appreciate the benefits of having an information technology system in which the health professionals can input a unique identifier and access all the relevant information about a patient, including medical history, allergy information, special care requests and so forth. Such capability is essential for another key component of the Government's reform strategy, that is, the implementation of the money-follows-the-patient system. Under this system, we will move away from the block grant system which provides a substantial level of public money to a hospital with little in the way of performance indicators or monitoring. Under the new system, once the need for treatment is established hospitals will be funded only for those patients who they treat. This will act as an incentive, patients will receive treatment more speedily and, as long as appropriate safeguards are in place, more readily and more efficiently with regard to standards of care. Within such a system a unique identifier will be critical. The Minister put it best when outlining the case for the health identifier. He suggested it was about better patient safety and care, he noted that the case has been established internationally and he pointed out that it would ensure the right information would be associated with the right person. As far back as 2008 the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance recommended this measure, as has the Health Information and Quality Authority, which has advocated that identifiers should be used and provided for health care providers as well as individuals accessing the health care system. This is of great importance. One of the most surprising things is that this measure has not been introduced heretofore or that it is not already part of the system, especially since everyone has a PPS number. It could have been introduced far earlier. Perhaps there is the case for the PPS number to be used as it is, rather than embarking on the initial cost of a new health identifier card. I presume there may be reasons why that is not possible. I imagine there will be a register which the Minister or the Department of Health will be responsible for maintaining and that it will include all the usual information, including name, address, PPS number, date of birth and so forth as well as a health identifier number. This is most important. The Data Protection Commissioner has been consulted and I emphasise that the lists of identifying information cannot include an individual's clinical information. All in all, this is positive. It will help with patient safety, it will improve the ease of identity of patients and it will ensure that no mistakes are made in terms of their care, which is of paramount importance.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	275	I almost needed some health identification myself after running to the Chamber. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Bill, which is a further significant reform of the health service. Last week, similar legislation was introduced by the Minister. These are necessary reforms of the health services as provided for in the programme for Government. As Deputy Kyne noted, this particular reform has been spoken of for seven or eight years. The idea is that health professionals would have at their disposal all relevant information on the patient they are seeking to treat, including in an emergency situation, and this is most welcome. This proposal must take into consideration a significant area of difficulty, namely, the requirements of data protection and the rights of any individual or citizen to have his information protected, while, at the same time, ensuring that he can get access to necessary medical treatment. This could produce a conflict but, as I understand it, the Bill has been approved by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner with regard to ensuring that only essential information that is required for health professionals is made available to them when they need it. This is part of an ongoing list of proposals from the Minister aimed at reforming how our health services are delivered. Last week's legislation was essentially the first step in dismantling the HSE and changing the way the HSE is funded, by ensuring that the executive is funded directly from the Department of Health, as it should be. This was a significant step in the right direction. Last year, the Minister for Health embarked on significant reform of the way our acute medical services are operated throughout the country. This involved the realignment of hospital services throughout the country. We have moved from a position where 30 years ago each local authority had a health committee to a regional-based system, which was replaced, in turn, by the HSE when Deputy Martin was the Minister for Health. For the most part and despite the many excellent people who work in the HSE on the front line and in administration, the executive has been an unmitigated disaster for the delivery of health services in the country. This is why last week's legislation to dismantle the organisation in respect of its funding was a significant step in the right direction. The establishment of the new hospital groups and the Minister's commitment to a new system of money following the patient has become something of a clichÃ© but it holds out the prospect for significant improvements in how our acute hospitals are funded in future and it represents a further significant positive step for the Department of Health. The Minister for Health is often much-maligned in certain quarters but he has shown vigour in reforming how the service is delivered and that is to be welcomed. I fully support this important legislation which he has introduced to ensure that medical professionals have access to essential information about the patients they seek to treat. This is why I am supporting the Bill.

They are concrete, practical actions to maintain the sustainability of the post office network. Unless those steps are taken, the Irish Postmasters' Union believes, as I do, that the network will suffer serious damage and a reduction in services. Such a reduction will have a knock-on effect on communities throughout the country. The motion follows on from a commitment in the programme for Government 2011-16 which states that the Government will ensure that the network of post offices around the country is maintained and that communities have access to adequate postal services in their locality. Compared to other retailers, the An Post network is extensive with 1,156 branches. Musgraves, for instance, has 895 branches, while there are 412 credit union offices. The Bank of Ireland has 255 branches, Allied Irish Bank 183, Ulster Bank 146, and there are 37 local authority offices. An Post's is therefore an extensive network which is available throughout the country both in urban and rural areas, including the smallest communities. The An Post network serves not just rural areas, as may generally be thought, but is also available in many urban centres. In Dublin city the post office network comprises some 104 branches serving mainly disadvantaged communities throughout the capital. If the network is not maintained, sustained and supported quite a number of post offices will face closure, not only in rural areas but also in urban centres. I want to welcome the postmasters who are present in the Public Gallery from around the country for this Private Members' debate, which will continue tomorrow evening. One of the key problems facing the post office service is the possible loss of the social welfare contract in the short or medium term. The Grant Thornton follow-up report, which was commissioned by the Irish Postmasters' Union, indicated various scenarios. First, it stated that if there was no change, the social welfare contract was renewed and the Department's e-payment strategy did not go ahead, then the network would continue with few closures, if any. The second scenario was where the social welfare contract would be lost completely. That would have a knock-on effect involving the closure of 557 of the 1,150 branches, which is a reduction of 48%. The third scenario is where the social welfare contract is renewed but at a lower level of transaction due to the move to e-payments. That would reduce the network involving the closure of over 444 post office branches throughout the country, both in urban and rural areas.  My colleagues will cover many of the other areas involved, but I wish to refer briefly to the Government's amendment to the motion. In a statement earlier today, the Minister said that the Government has no plans to close post offices. The Government may not have such plans but the real question is whether the Government is prepared to allow post offices to wither away. Or is the Government prepared to take practical, concrete steps to ensure the continuation of the post office network throughout the country? Unfortunately and disappointingly, an initial reading suggests that the Government's amendment contains no practical or concrete steps to ensure the retention of the post office service, as provided for in the programme for Government. I await the Minister's contribution on this matter.

I congratulate them on their level of organisation and I wish them well in their protest at 7 p.m. tomorrow outside the gates of Leinster House. The Communications Workers' Union, CWU, supports the protest and has written to all its members and asked them to attend. It, therefore, will be a large protest and will also include people who support the post office network. I take this opportunity to state that I am a member of the CWU and that I have worked as a post office clerk since 1979. I must, therefore, declare an interest in that I hope I will have a job to return to in two or three years' time.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	279	I am aware that there is much goodwill among postmasters in the context of recognising CWU members in their post offices. The programme for Government contains a commitment to maintain the post office network as a result of the role it plays socially and economically. We want the Minister to indicate that this commitment will be adhered to. His announcement to the effect that no post offices will be closed is welcome. The post office network is, however, being undermined by means of particular actions, even, possibly, by those of the Government. The network is crucial in both rural and urban areas. I attended a residents association meeting on Friday night last and I was approached by a number of elderly women who had heard that up to 600 post offices could close as a result of a lack of financial transactions being conducted on their premises. The women to whom I refer do not receive their payments by means of electronic funds transfer. Another matter about which they are concerned - this was also highlighted by Deputy Healy - is that many banks are pulling out of villages and smaller communities. For example, only one bank branch remains open in Inchicore village following the recent closure of the Bank of Ireland branch there. Many of the elderly women I met cannot, therefore, access their funds via the banking system. It must be recognised that 18% of Irish people do not have bank accounts. These tend to be individuals who are on low incomes or in receipt of social welfare payments. Some 23% - almost one quarter - of the population do not have Internet access. Again, those involved in this regard are low income earners, those in receipt social welfare payments and old age pensioners who rely on over-the-counter payments at their post offices. People also rely on the post office to pay their bills. The type of individuals to whom I refer may visit their local post office regularly to pay â¬10 off their gas, electricity, telephone or refuse collection bills. Post offices constitute an important social network which is - to our minds and those of the postmasters - being undermined by the Department of Social Protection's strategy to move to electronic payments. Despite winning the contract for this part of the Department's business, post offices are losing out because that business is being transferred to the banks by the Department on a daily basis. The Irish Postmasters' Union has evidence, both written and oral, which confirms this. For example, there is correspondence from the local officer in Bantry in which people are informed that before their claims can be decided, they must submit details of their bank accounts. People are not being given a choice and if this continues, post offices will no longer have the business relating to welfare payments and hundreds could be forced to close as a result. That is an important point. While the Minister is committed to not closing post offices, they could actually close by default as a result of actions on the part of some of his ministerial colleagues and their Departments. Post offices are the bedrock on which the network was built. What happened in the UK in this regard has been made quite clear to the Government. The main lesson it can take from the experience in that jurisdiction is that it must act to bridge the potential â¬60 million a year deficit which could hit the network. If it does not do so, the network cannot survive. Grant Thornton reports that up to half of our post offices - up to 600 - will close if action is not taken. This potential closure of post offices would fly in the face of the commitment to which I referred earlier but also the Government's strategy of financial inclusion, which identifies the provision of a basic payment account, PBA, as a first step. Such an account would meet the needs of financially excluded people and its regular use would enable people to build up financial profiles for themselves. This, in turn, could assist poorer people in accessing mainstream credit rather than being obliged to approach moneylenders. The motion calls for the establishment of an action plan - we want to hear from the Minister that such a plan will be forthcoming - and that a report on the progress made in respect of its implementation will be made within six months of the plan's publication. The longer the delay in respect of this matter, the greater will be the danger that post offices will be forced to close as opposed to being closed by the Government.

That goes to the heart of the matter under discussion. Our post offices work very well and the staff who work in them provide a range of services in a very friendly, helpful and courteous way. There is potential for even further services to be provided at our post offices but we are now finding they are under threat. The Irish Postmasters' Union's slogan to the effect that we should not let the heart of our communities die is very apt. Post offices are at the heart of communities and they offer a range of services to people of all ages. I acknowledge the work of the Irish Postmasters' Union in respect of this matter. All postmasters want is for the current Administration to honour the commitment it made in the programme for Government. That will mean developing a plan. Without a plan, difficulties will arise in the context of the very survival of the post office network. It is vital that the Government should honour its commitment and bring forward an action plan which contains timelines. Nobody wants to witness the demise of the post office network. People trust their local post offices. This is because they have built up relationships with the staff. Post offices are reliable, dependable and extremely receptive to those people who, for various reasons, do not want to conduct business online. The personal touch is in evidence to a much greater degree in post offices than in banks. On the occasions on which I have visited bank branches in recent times, I have continually been directed to machines. I do not want to do business with a machine, I want to do it with a real person. That is what happens when I visit my local post office. The range of services available at the post office includes social welfare payments, savings facilities, the passport service, bill-pay services, postal services and the purchase of stationery supplies. Post offices are also a centre of information in respect of the various services that are available within communities. They are, therefore, a real asset. There are serious implications to not having in place a plan to ensure their sustainability and viability. What will happen is that there will be a drop in the number of people in employment and up to 500 post offices will be closed before 2017. The Irish Postmasters' Union has commissioned two reports, the first of which includes a series of proposals on what could make post offices more sustainable. Each of these proposals included a cost-benefit outcome and the report estimates that if they were all implemented, more than â¬80 million in savings could be realised. Most of those savings would be to the benefit of the taxpayer. When the union requested a follow-up study, this concluded that the sustainability of post offices is at risk as a result of the Government's attitude towards contracts such as that relating to welfare payments. The system of making such payments through post offices works very well. This is because post office staff know the people who are in receipt of such payments. If somebody does not turn up to obtain his or her payment as a result of an accident or something worse, the staff will follow up on the matter. The Irish Postmasters' Union informs us that its staff act as a fraud deterrent element. As already stated, the staff know the people who present regularly to receive their payments and, as a result, the threat of impersonation is eliminated. It is also the case that if a person does not collect his or her payment within a certain period, it will be returned to the Exchequer. If payments are made electronically through the banks, there is no oversight whatsoever. Post offices play a really important role in the context of budgeting. This is because people can pay particular amounts off their bills on a regular basis. They can also buy special stamps to save for their television licences. I cannot see the banks providing a similar service. In addition, banks are not always so easily accessible. This is due to the number of closures and amalgamations that have taken place in recent years. Post offices are very accessible because many of them are located on streets on which small businesses are to be found. When they visit their post offices, people also frequent these businesses and shop locally. If post offices are closed, the businesses to which I refer will also close and more ghost villages will be created as a result. Post offices provide excellent service in the context of facilitating people's passport applications and giving them access to State savings and investment options. I am of the view that they could also play a role in the context of the new driving licence initiative. Great credit is due to the Deputy Healy for drafting this motion. When I first read the motion, I could not envisage how the Government could table an amendment to it. The Deputy is basically calling on the Government to develop a comprehensive action plan. The Government's amendment acknowledges that the network is a vital and unique asset and states that it is "essential to our local communities and the country as a whole". If we all agree that it is essential, then why has an amendment been tabled and why is Deputy Healy's motion, as drafted, not being accepted?I accept the use of e-mail has caused a decline but I do not think that decline is irreversible. I would hate to see us lose the art of letter-writing and I would hate to think of what could have been lost if e-mail had been invented years ago.  The Government amendment acknowledges the suitability of the post office network for over-the-counter business and service. The Minister stated in his contribution that maintaining the post office network is at the heart of national and local community life. Competition law and procurement are all very well but they should not be favoured at the expense of a viable, thriving business that is providing essential services to the communities we all represent in both urban and rural areas.

I commend my colleague, Deputy Seamus Healy, and my Independent colleagues for bringing this motion before the House. I fully support the Irish Postmasters' Union in its efforts to save its members' businesses, staff and excellent community service. I remind the Minister and the House that the post office network employs over 3,000 people. The post office network plays a key role in providing financial services and it is one of the most important brands in the country and helps to deter fraud. The post office is at the heart of every Irish community. For these reasons we should support this motion. I urge all Deputies to support the proposals in this very sensible motion. The Government cannot keep talking about jobs and job creation and then put 450 to 500 people in post offices out of work between 2013 and 2017. The loss of â¬20 million in revenue a year brings into question the future sustainability of postmasters. I am conscious of the impact of closures of post offices in communities in my constituency of Dublin Bay North and around the country. Now is the time to stand up for our post offices and for our community services. Sitting on the fence or staying silent in this debate is not an option. In Kilbarrack, Coolock, Artane, Beaumont, Raheny, Darndale, Howth or Sutton, the people want a top quality post office service and we all need to get behind them before it is too late. If the Minister and his colleagues do not support this motion they are in breach of their programme for Government and they will be voting against the sustainability of the post office network. No more fudge, no more ducking and diving. The issue is about preserving jobs and the future of this country. The post office network is a unique social, cultural and financial institution essential to local communities and it makes a vital contribution to the Irish economy. It employs over 3,000 people throughout the country. It is the backbone of rural and urban communities. The Department of Social Protection plans for the electronic transfer of social welfare payments pose a serious threat to the future of the post office network. Without the income derived from the Department of Social Protection and NTMA contracts, the viability of the post office network will be destabilised. It will directly cause a reduction in cash payments at post offices which will ultimately lead to many closures and job losses throughout the country. The post office network provides a vital national strategic asset. This motion is about the future of our post offices and the saving of local community services; it is about the future of 3,000 jobs; it is about common sense and new ideas for developing the services of the network. I urge all Deputies to support this urgent and important motion and to vote for it tomorrow night.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	284	I thank Deputy Seamus Healy for proposing this important and timely motion. The post office service is at the heart of our community services with a long history of hundreds of years. I remind the House of the importance of the service in ensuring our very survival, given the remittances that kept this country afloat for generations. The post office organisation has been capable of change and it has met challenges through the centuries, most recently with the advent of electronic communications.  The Minister's press release stated that the Government has no plans to close post offices. What I want to hear is what plan has he to keep them open. That is the more pertinent question. The Minister announced that the post office network will encompass central and local government and he has promised a Cabinet committee will examine social policy. He announced that the examination will be holistic, "to look at the range of services which could be provided by the post office network and could perhaps yield synergies among the various agencies." This is not a very definitive statement and the Minister is very good at crafting fine words but I think people will be looking for more than those words; they will want to know how he will make that happen. I ask if the Minister has been in a bank recently. Nowadays, banks only want virtual customers; they do not want real people walking around and they do not want old-age pensioners standing there, who are perhaps a little bit slower than they were earlier in their lives and they need a little bit more time to make a transaction. They are not linked to the Internet. They want to interact with a human being. The post office provides a very real human service which is delivered in a very personal way.  I agree it is positive to consider new ways for post offices to deliver additional services. However, the Department of Social Protection is a critical component of the service because it pays out child benefit, pensions and welfare payments through the post office network. The Department of Social Protection has cut back hugely on the community welfare office services and these services are now more remote from people. The closures may have cut the cost for the Department but we all know that it transfers that cost from the State onto the individual at a time when he or she most needs help. The Department of Social Protection must be part of the solution in ensuring the viability of the post office network.

Having been educated by the Jesuits, I suggest the Minister might avoid the temptation to use Jesuitical language. Let us talk clearly. The motion is clear and snappy. My colleagues and I support all the people in the post offices around the country. I am proud to say there is a post office near where I live on The Rise in Mount Merrion and it is a superb institution. I would hate to see anything that would undermine it.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	I thank Deputy Healy for putting forward this motion and I congratulate the members of the Technical Group who have joined together to present this motion to the House. It calls on the Government to maintain the post office network and sets out viable steps, with clear timeframes, for how this can be achieved. The motion is backed by the Irish Postmasters' Union. It is the responsibility of the Government to realise a long-term plan for the future of the postal service. That responsibility is acknowledged in the programme for Government and reiterated in the joint Oireachtas committee report on the future of the postal service. Despite this, we are presented tonight with an amendment that has a Pontius Pilate quality to it, with the Government effectively washing its hands of its obligation to do anything to save the post office network. There has been a 15% decline in the network since 2006. The revenue from mail continues to decrease, with a 25% reduction in the past five years. However, the post office is about more than mail services and it is not good enough merely to fall back on the excuse of competition and public procurement issues, as the Government does in its amendment. The local post office is at the heart of communities across the country. It offers a vital connection and source of human contact for elderly people, those dependent on social welfare and others. The potential closure of local post offices is an issue that has featured regularly in Topical Issue debates in this House in recent years. Colleagues and I have focused on the status of particular post offices and sought to protect individual communities. These include communities like Bunbeg in Donegal whose post office is currently under threat, and communities like Greencastle and Inishowen whose post offices have been given a stay of execution for 12 months. The real problem is that the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and his Cabinet colleagues do not recognise the value of An Post and of a service that is important to every community in the country. The Minister is saying he is limited by competition and public procurement requirements. In fact, those concerns are not as restricting as he claims. He can choose to use social clauses, as provided for under European legislation and used extensively throughout Europe, in France, Greece, Spain, Germany and Italy. The inclusion of such clauses in public tendering contracts means the successful contractor must meet certain social requirements. An Post is ideally placed to satisfy that type of social obligation if the Minister would only choose to deploy such clauses. The problem is that he has chosen not to do so. That is the problem underlying his amendment and it is the underlying problem with Government policy on postal services. The roll-out of the standard bank account represents another missed opportunity for the Government to safeguard and enhance the viability of rural post offices. At least two years on from the formation of a working group and in the wake of last year's pilot project, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, stated the following in his reply to a parliamentary question last week on the roll-out of the standard payment account:The report of the working group on the pilot project noted the view of stakeholders that one of the key elements required as part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a standard bank account is greater involvement by An Post...Â  This was seen as necessary to have the best possible channel for reaching the target cohorts.Instead of commencing the roll-out of the basic bank account on 1 January, as promised, the Department of Finance has entered into bilateral discussions with stakeholders in order to determine the next steps following the pilot project. There has been no decision to include An Post in the roll-out, a move which would go a long way to making post offices viable into the future. The failure to take decisive action in regard to social clauses and the roll-out of the standard bank account is killing post offices throughout the State. If the Minister is serious about preventing the closure of post offices, he must take action on these fronts without delay, instead of bringing forward an amendment that includes no timescales and no commitments and simply refers to what other Departments need to do. That is not a response to the motion. It speaks of a laissez-faire attitude and an intention on the part of the Government to continue, like Pontius Pilate, washing its hands of its responsibilities regarding the future of post offices in this country.

I begin by declaring an interest in this matter in that I own a small post office and am the postmaster there. I am happy to say that it provides a job for one individual. If everybody created one job, it would be a great thing. I compliment the Irish Postmasters' Union, including its general secretary, Brian McGann, as well as Tom O'Callaghan and the other members who represent postmasters throughout the country in such an excellent way. I welcome the postmasters and other post office workers who are in the Gallery tonight. I also welcome in advance the people who will travel from all parts of the country tomorrow to show the Minister how people in both rural and urban areas feel about their local post office. These are genuine people. It is not easy for them to take time out from their busy lives to get on a bus in Limerick, Galway or Kerry and come up to Dublin. They are doing so because they want to show the Government what they believe in their hearts and souls. It is very wrong that the Minister and the Government are putting people to this worry. They were sold a pup in the programme for Government because the Government has not kept the promises it contains. I compliment the excellent people who have run post offices over the years. When I hear about Tesco and other places running post offices, I am reminded of what happened in Killarney. Tesco was like Lord Haw-Haw when it began selling cheap petrol in the town and ultimately shut down 12 or 13 petrol stations. Once that was done, it increased the price of petrol and Killarney is now one of the most expensive places in the country in which to buy petrol. This happened because of one multinational company that came in and sold people a pup. That company will do the exact same with the post offices if it gets them. I would like to see the Fine Gael and Labour Party Members who will vote against this motion tomorrow night going back to their constituencies and telling people what they did. They are doing one thing in here but saying something different in their own places. I have to tolerate people from the Minister's party and from Fine Gael going around the constituency I represent letting on that they are for rural post offices before coming up here and voting against Deputy Healy's motion. It is hypocritical and misleading. They are lying and that is wrong.

They are meagre with the truth. When it comes to the local elections, I urge people to ask the candidates who come to their door whether they are for rural post offices and the post office network or if they are happy to go along with the Labour Party and Fine Gael line. The Minister for Social Protection - otherwise known as Wonder Woman, according to the Sunday Independent - has a great deal to answer in this regard. If Wonder Woman really is interested in retaining jobs, she should be directing new recipients of welfare, in a proactive way, to use their post offices. The bottom line is that if we do not use our post offices, we will lose them. Our small pubs are gone. Our small shops are gone. Petrol stations are gone. Small GP clinics are gone. Local hardware shops are gone. The creameries are gone. If the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, keeps going the way he is going, we will be left with nothing but the three Bs - briars, bullocks and badgers. The banks have made a mess of our country; now they want to make a mess of our post office network. The Government's amendment is a sop that will allow its backbenchers to come in here with their heads down and row in behind the party line like sheep. As other speakers have stated, there is no need for an amendment. It is nothing but nonsense because the motion before us is perfect. I conclude by remembering the old-time warriors who worked in our post offices. The old postmasters who also had to run the telephone exchanges started work at 8 a.m. and kept on until 10 p.m., putting in a 14-hour day. I had the privilege of knowing some of them and I remember them tonight in a heartfelt way. They are gone to their eternal reward, God be good to them. They served our communities well for very little reward. Perhaps they are praying that the Minister will see the light and ensure our post offices, in both rural and urban communities, are kept intact. It will be a disgrace if he lets anything happen to them.

I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to it. The post office has a unique standing in Irish life. As an institution, it is trusted and highly respected by the people. Apart entirely from its significant economic contribution over the years, the post office network has evolved a social role, in the widest meaning of the term, which is highly valued by local communities. Perhaps that social role is most valued in rural Ireland, where 64% of the post office network serves 38% of the population. Notwithstanding the changes wrought over the decades, the post office network has stood firm, as testified to by the fact that 1,147 post offices are doing business today. Obviously, I have been disappointed to read headlines in recent days asserting that 557 post offices are to close. The impression is given that somewhere, somehow, the Government has announced there is a plan to shut down post offices. There is no such plan. Unless there is a compelling case, the Government does not want to see a single post office closed. The Government welcomes the fact that although 197 post offices were closed between 2006 and 2010, just 17 closures have occurred since 2010. Only today, a spanking new post office was opened in Terenure. I do not recall closing any office in north or south Kerry.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	294	Like everyone else, An Post has not escaped the challenging economic environment since the economic collapse in 2008. The diminishing mail volume, which is due to technological advances, is even more challenging. These hugely influential factors are appreciated at every level of the postal network. They are ignored by nobody other than the authors of this motion. The economic collapse and the onset of the digital economy must be factored into any serious assessment of the future of the post office network. Some Deputies might wonder where the headlines about post office closures have come from. Some callers to my office are certainly querying this. The answer is that a consultancy report has calculated that the loss of the social welfare contract, which is worth approximately â¬50 million to An Post, would lead to the closure of 557 post offices in a worst case scenario. The point is that An Post did not lose the social welfare contract. In fact, it won the contract in a tender process as recently as last year. The Irish Postmasters' Union is prudently asking what might happen in the future. The motion gives all sides of the House a useful opportunity to have a full and frank debate on the future sustainability of the post office network. While the motion that has been proposed leans towards a more pessimistic view of future changes, I believe there is every reason to be more optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for the post office network in the digital age. It is clear from the overall results of An Post that the retail network business has grown over the past five years as the mail business has been contracting sharply. Some people might say this is due to unique factors such as social protection payments and demands for NTMA products. I disagree because I believe the post office over-the-counter business now offers services that are very different from those it offered in the past. Foreign exchange, passport, bank agency and tax payment services are provided in a competitive environment to customers who can choose to do business in other ways. That so many Irish people use these services bears testament to the quality of front-line staff and the ability of management teams who are working to support those staff. For the reasons I have mentioned, I cannot accept the motion that has been proposed. I acknowledge some of the important issues and challenges raised in it. The post office network is a unique social, cultural and financial institution that makes a vital contribution to the economy. The post office is the provider of choice to a vast number of people who regard it as dependable, trustworthy and friendly. The professionalism of the postmasters, the unions, the board and the management of An Post has served the network well over the years. I do not see why this should not continue to be the case in the years ahead. An Post is a trusted brand. It is seen as a local reliable service in urban and rural areas. An Post has the largest retail presence in the country, with more than 1,100 outlets reaching almost 1.7 million customers. Its accessibility to almost everyone in the country is one of its main strengths. Like all other companies, An Post has faced up to a challenging economic climate in recent years. It has had to tackle diminishing mail volumes and seek alternative avenues of income. An Post's core mail business has suffered a major fall in recent times. This has had a serious impact on the company's revenue flow. In response, the company is proactively seeking to keep costs down and diversify its business. As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I am keen to see the development of a digital economy and to progress further the digital agenda. Electronic substitution affects every aspect of our lives. Undoubtedly, it is having an impact on the traditional over-the-counter services offered by the post office network. The increased use of newer technologies, which is a simple fact of life, should be viewed as an opportunity to be grasped rather than a problem to be eradicated. An Post has undertaken a programme of capital investment, particularly in computerising and automating the post office network, introducing new products and making greater market investment. As a result, post offices are well placed to provide electronic and more traditional financial services. While the move towards further electronic transactions is inevitable, many people are not comfortable dealing with machines and prefer face-to-face services, as Deputies Joan Collins and Maureen O'Sullivan have said. An Post is in a unique position to offer electronic services to such customers without losing the personal engagement the customer requires. An Post faces the same challenges as all commercial organisations that are developing new strategies to adapt to the greater role of e-commerce in the economy. In the face of such challenges, An Post has made great efforts to expand its business. I have supported its attempts to diversify income streams and win a wider range of commercial contracts that offer higher profit margins. I believe the postmasters and An Post can go further to develop new business. The potential exists to roll out a standard bank account, for example. Perhaps the post offices might come together with the Irish League of Credit Unions to offer a solution in this area. The Irish Postmasters' Union commissioned Grant Thornton to review the range of contract services offered across the post office network. The two reports that were published on foot of this review - one in 2012 and the latest one this month - outline options for new commercial business arrangements. Last year, the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications published a report highlighting a range of opportunities that could be pursued and acknowledging the high regard in which the network is held and the confidence that people have in the post office. The fact that 64% of the post office network is located in rural areas brings in another factor relating to rural sustainability and future development. A wide range of issues must be tackled to ensure the economic continuity of businesses and communities in rural areas. Operational matters and the development of commercial strategies with regard to the post office network are matters for An Post. Nevertheless, it is true that as a shareholder, I have a strong interest in and concern for the future sustainability of the company. This is backed up by the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure the sustainability of the post office network and the cross-party acknowledgement that the network is a vital national strategic asset.For these reasons, I am pleased to announce that Government has agreed a whole-of-government consideration, encompassing central and local government and the wider public service, of the nature and extent of services that can be provided to the public using the post office network as a front office of government. This whole-of-government analysis will be undertaken in the first instance by the Cabinet committee on social policy with a view to a report to Government by that committee. I assure Deputy Healy Rae that his favourite Minister, the Minister for Social Protection, will be on that committee.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	Indeed. This will afford an opportunity for a holistic review of the range of services which could be provided by the post office network and could perhaps yield synergies among the different agencies. I must stress one point, however. An Post is a commercial State company that earns its own keep and receives no Exchequer subsidy. My colleagues and I cannot arrange a hidden subsidy for it by dictating that all or even any Government business is automatically given to An Post. These are commercial contracts that must, under EU and Irish public procurement law, go out to competitive public tender between all interested parties. Deputy Pringle's point about adding in a few social clauses that he claims surmounts these barriers in France and Germany does not happen, and I do not advise him to try it. The Department of Social Protection is in the course of making significant changes in the delivery of its services on a nationwide basis. Notwithstanding this, it will remain for the foreseeable future the most significant corporate customer of the post office network. The winning by An Post of the tender for the over-the-counter cash payments for social welfare during 2013 will have an important stabilising effect on the company in the short to medium term. However, technological change, consumer choice and expectations and the actions of An Post's competitors will give rise to substantial new challenges in the years ahead. The priority for Government is that An Post is in a position to compete and win contracts for payment services independent of the technology platform. An Post may be the best-known and most successful indigenous brand we have. However, this will not suffice if it is not able to provide the services demanded by its customers in the way that those services are required and in the location where those services are needed. The nature of the post office counter business and the traditions embodied by it do not make transition easy when change is required. I believe it is fundamentally wrong for the State as shareholder to constrain the capacity of the company to provide competing services where these are demanded by its customers. It is important to reflect briefly on the experience of the Irish retail sector as a whole over the past decade. Deputies will be aware of the enormous changes wrought on the sector by a number of key structural forces. The first is the scale of the recession and pre-existing credit bubble which has, more than any other single factor, led to retail shutdowns. The evidence is that post offices - particularly larger offices - have been protected from the worst impact of economic decline because their business is social in nature, relying on a high volume of transactions conducted on behalf of the Department of Social Protection. However, the smaller offices have been affected by movements in trade resulting from the closure of adjacent business. Post offices have traditionally been based on the high street. This is fine so long as the bulk of retail activity takes place there. However, when activity moves to a nearby shopping centre, consumers show a preference for on-site provision of service, rather than walking to a separate location to conduct their business. An Post might regret that this physical transfer of business is taking place, but it will ignore it at its peril. It is certainly not ignored by An Post's competitors. This is where they are establishing their points of presence. The second factor I would list is the scale of youth emigration, particularly from the regions, which has happened as a result of the recession. The third is the extent of e-substitution, which is rapidly changing the shape of bricks-and-mortar retailing, most notably in the whole area of over-the-counter business and services. Companies and businesses that do not have an electronic channel to market will suffer. The Government's digital strategy recognises this reality and seeks to accelerate the move forward by SMEs. There is not much point in expecting the world to stand still while An Post remains committed to over-the-counter business. The reality is that An Post's competitors are moving quickly into electronic transactions. An Post is obliged to respond to this if it is to retain its pre-eminent position in the marketplace. If competitors can offer electronic services at a cost much lower than over-the-counter transactions, it is unreasonable for us to impede An Post from also providing these electronic services. Fourth, there is the phenomenon of retail concentration. Commercial and trading businesses are moving out of small rural towns into supermarkets based in larger county and provincial centres. An Post's competitors are establishing a point-of-sale presence in the larger retail outlets, where the bulk of the population conduct the bulk of their weekly shopping. That presence represents a significant threat to the company if it does not respond. The Government's amendment to the motion is based on three principles. It builds on the core strengths of the existing post office network. It addresses the need for future sustainability by focusing on competing for and winning new business. It engages all key public sector stakeholders in a whole-of-government consideration of the scope for service provision. The long-term health of the post office network requires focused, long-term company action, in co-operation with the Government, and not an approach that may be based on the best of intentions but is not based on an enduring capacity to deliver competitive services, freely chosen and locally provided. There is no doubt that further challenges will present themselves in the years ahead. Prevailing against these challenges will require dedication and hard work. I am convinced that An Post possesses the capacity and drive to adapt to the changing needs of customers, as well as the necessary commitment and resolution to continue to develop the post office network. In doing so, it will have my active support and that of the Government.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	This is a very important issue for people throughout Ireland and I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this pivotal debate for the third time on the floor of this House in the past seven months. I am pleased that the Minister has for the first time committed to a whole-of-government approach to devise a comprehensive plan, involving all the relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Postmasters' Union. It will explore real and meaningful ways to ensure the sustainability and survival of the post office network which has in excess of 1,000 offices and sub-offices, through using the post office network as the front office of government. That is a very important step forward and should be acknowledged. The survival of the network is predicated on the revenue generated from main Government contracts, mainly the social welfare payment contract and the NTMA savings portfolio. Prior to Christmas the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in the company of Mr. Mueller, the chairperson of An Post, announced at the GPO the renewal of the contract relating to the delivery of social welfare payments to customers, which is worth up to â¬50 million to An Post and is one of the pivotal elements in helping to secure the position of sub-post offices throughout the State. The contract is for an initial period which can be renewed. The contract importantly stipulates a control element in the payment by way of having to furnish individual identification documents, which is an important aspect of security control in terms of reducing fraud. I believe this unique element can only be provided by the post offices and their personnel. I would be confident that An Post should secure that social welfare contract well into the future. The programme for Government contains a specific commitment in respect of ensuring the sustainability of the post office network, which is a national and strategic asset. This is why the announcement the Minister has made tonight to put flesh on the bones of the commitment is so important. We need a whole-of-government approach with each appropriate Department and agency, and other elements of the public service obliged to make an input or submission as to how a particular service it is pursuing might be done through the post office network. Where they identify new businesses they should examine the possibility of these services being provided through the post office network. As a Deputy representing a mainly rural constituency, I have witnessed the withdrawal over many years of financial services from these areas. Bank branches and sub-branches have been closed down leaving people with no facilities. Many of these people are elderly with little or no public transport available to bring them to the nearest big town where they might not even be well known.In this context, therefore, I urge the exploration of the possibility of post offices becoming satellite offices for the credit union movement. Obviously this would have to be explored and agreed with the credit union movement at headquarters. It would give access to many people who live in isolated areas and who have no ready means of transport, public or otherwise. It would also give great comfort to such people who might be saving a few bob to lodge same and have ease of access to same in the event of an emergency. It would at least allow a quasi-form of banking to be made available in rural areas, and the post office is an ideal vehicle for delivering that. Likewise, the State owns 98% of AIB. Surely a link-up with this financial institution could be explored and if found positive could be embraced. Post offices have anchors throughout the country, with there being 1,130 postmasters and sub-post offices, and these can facilitate the exploitation and use of all these facilities. The plan or review process should be open-ended, not subject to limitations, and should examine how additional services can be profitably provided. One must at all times acknowledge the social utility value of having services close to the user, which the post office network allows and achieves in a very noble fashion. Therefore, the Government must, as part of its plan or consideration, examine the possibility of providing a banking service through the post office network and operated by An Post. The board of directors of An Post need to wake up and smell the coffee and be creative and forward-thinking and not be running to the Tesco branches or anywhere else. Instead they need to examine, as the Minister said, the possibility of the post office network bringing in and putting in place electronic transfer fund mechanisms. The possibility of An Post expanding its operations and providing current account facilities, either on its own or on behalf of associated banks, could open up huge opportunities. There are a myriad of significant opportunities which should be explored in the context of this plan or review, especially the provision of services on behalf of Departments, semi-State bodies and local authorities. I wrote to one such body today, namely, Irish Water seeking that it would ensure the post office network is utilised for the next number of months for the purpose of collecting the new water rates charge. More than one million bills will be processed and this could be an invaluable source of revenue for An Post. This is a new area where the post office network could be utilised and it is ideally situated for the mutual benefit of Irish Water and the postmasters and postmistresses. Some 800,000 customers interface with the Department of Social Protection and here we have 21% more customers available, especially many elderly who would deal with the post office every week. This is an ideal place to start. We have the Government commitment and assurance that it will not close post offices, but it is important we show the way forward of how that can be achieved in a real and sustainable way. I agree with the Grant Thornton analysis that the most viable option to secure the post office network is for the Government's contracts to continue to be won by An Post, and while these are subject to EU law and competition law, I believe this is eminently achievable. I call on the Department of Social Protection to desist from issuing letters to social welfare recipients informing them of the availability of electronic transfer of funds or e-payments, which specifically refers to the banks. Why not state clearly and unequivocally in these letters that the facility to receive cash from the post offices is and remains a viable option? The post office network should be upgraded to accommodate the electronic transfer of funds directly. People should be afforded the clear opportunity of opting out of electronic funds transfer and to continue to receive their welfare payments over the counter as normal. This must be part of any review, consultation or plan, and how the basic payment account plan can be implemented should also be part of that. We must never disregard the social utility value of post offices. Not everything can be evaluated and assessed in terms of balance sheet or bottom line style economics. The human interaction, advice and help plays an essential and crucial role, which is inestimable in terms of value. A balance sheet approach discounts social policy, and that is a failing. It is a significant area that can be exploited and I urge Minister to ensure this review would take all those points into account in a very meaningful and sustainable way.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I commend Deputy Healy and the Independent group on bringing forward the motion. I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me. As somebody who has used the services of An Post at my local post office since childhood, I am acutely aware of the need to preserve the services and enhance them. Given the enormous change that has taken place in people's lifestyles and in technology, every business and organisation is undergoing a massive shift in the way services are delivered. I firmly believe we must give An Post and the post offices of this country the tools and wherewithal to be able to adapt to that change. There is a great opportunity to maximise the productivity and output of each and every post office to deliver services in every parish and community in this State. Recent examples of how our post offices can deliver a service with maximum efficiency are An Post's passport service and its facilitating the payment of the property tax. Other such possibilities will arise with the payment of water charges, motor tax renewals and so on. It is important that post offices can deliver these services cheaply, efficiently and at more convenience to the consumer than any other organisation. They need to be given the chance to tender on an even playing field. I note that post offices were excluded from the start in respect of the driving licence service because of the criteria that were used about only having a very limited number of outlets in each county. Much recent discussion has centred on the Department of Social Protection plans for the electronic transfer of social welfare payments through the banks. Surely it should be possible for these payments to be made electronically to the post office as well. I understand that electronic payments can be made for An Post employees into their post office savings bank. In other words, the software is already in place to deliver that service. This would also make sense as an increasing number of banks either close branches or withdraw services from small rural towns and villages. AIB has in recent years closed many of its branches in small towns and Bank of Ireland in the same locations restricts counter services to just two days a week. The opportunity to fill that void should be given to our post offices. The payment of more social welfare payments should also help to reduce the risk of fraudulent payments, which rightly needs to be addressed, in order that those who deserve support can get it. Having attended last week the launch of the latest Grant Thornton report by the Irish Postmasters' Union and being involved last year as chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in producing our own report, I note there are many similar recommendations in both of them and welcome the fact that the Minister has acknowledged their input in providing solutions. Many of those recommendations, if implemented, would ensure the sustainability of the network. I welcome the Minister's announcement of the review which can move forward many of those recommendations. It is important to point out that it is not only the Government that can ensure the continued viability and sustainability of the post office network. It, along with all State bodies, should be given opportunities and should make services available through the local post office, but that challenges the community at large to avail of and use these services. I have stood in halls where 400 and 500 were gathered who protested at the threat to close the local post office. I want to be fair and balanced on this. I would imagine that many of those who protest are either not aware of the services their local post office provides or use the services in other areas. There is a challenge to the community to use these services. In the review that was carried out last year, An Post agreed to more consultation when there was a threat to a post office. Communities must be given the chance either to use their post office and pay their bills or risk the fact they might lose it. My experience is that the public often are not aware of the services on offer. They need to be educated about what services are available. There are also a number of perceptions regarding the threat to the post office network, one being that the threat exists only in isolated rural areas. It exists in small post offices in rural and urban areas and that needs to be addressed as well. It is not a rural versus urban issue. I am also convinced there is a need to get an increased number of younger people using the services in the post office. This was encouraged many years ago by the purchase of savings stamps or whatever. That initiative must be adapted for the modern needs and requirements of young people. It must also be noted that An Post has a responsibility for the future survival of the country's post office network. I note it has recently piloted a partnership with Tesco to provide some services in its outlets. Surely An Post cannot, on the one hand, assert that it wants to maintain the viability of the post office and, on the other hand, dilute those services to other outlets which further challenges that viability.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate on the future of the post office network. It is an issue that has been debated on Question Time over the years and a whole raft of issues arise. The same themes keep coming up, namely, the trusted brand of An Post, the retail network it has throughout the length and breadth of the country and the excellent work being done by postmasters and postmistresses, as well as the support and respect they command within their local communities. It is time we directly challenged An Post. It has been saying it wants to keep open the retail outlets and to engage with communities, yet post offices have been allowed to close the length and breadth of the country, particularly in rural communities, although urban communities have the same problems. Why is this? Many issues has been put forward by Government Departments, in reports by the Oireachtas joint committee and in the Grant Thornton report in regard to what services should be available. The first thing we have to establish clearly with the board and company of An Post is that, as a people, we want to maintain the highest number of offices possible. It then comes to the issue of viability. If we are going to take the viability route, and we have had these arguments back and forth over the floor of the House, then we are acknowledging that we will not maintain the post office network as it is currently. We have the trusted brand and the retail network, and if these need to be put to better use, then a whole raft of changes will be needed in order to maintain them. Three years ago, I suggested having the post offices as Government offices, which they have been in many places. This is based on the trust the postmasters or postmistresses have in their own communities among all age groups, who go to the post office for advice and for many other things apart from financial and social welfare services. We have to challenge the board and management of An Post, once and for all. They are hiding behind viability and a whole raft of issues. For example, if a family member does not want to continue the business, An Post will instead install a unit in a shop. The latest issue arises in regard to Tesco, which raises a fundamental issue for the future of An Post. We have to challenge An Post. There is a trusted brand and retail outlets the length and breadth of the country which need to be preserved. It is a State company. We have to make sure An Post is in sync with the Government if the policy is that we are going to maintain every single one of these post office units throughout the country, as they should be maintained, given they have been providing a massive service through the years. We have seen what has been lost, particularly in rural communities. People continuously ask me whether the policy is now to close down rural Ireland absolutely. It is very hard to argue with that because it is what is seen to be happening. We have to challenge the board and management of An Post directly as to what their policy is and whether they are going to step up to the plate. My colleague on the joint committee mentioned the driver licence issue, which was made so difficult that An Post could not tender for that contract. The reality is that every single Government contract should be put through An Post. It is a State company. While people talk about viability, there is a huge social aspect to An Post. I have seen communities that have lost their post offices, and they fall away immediately. I could mention many of them, including Mweeling, Tullylease and others in my own area. When they lose their post office, the next thing is that the local shop goes. The community is left with just a post box and its identity is lost. The reality is that An Post is far more than just a commercial entity in rural communities or in any community. We have to value our communities in more than commercial terms. As I have said on several occasions from both sides of this House, rural communities have provided a fantastic service right across the spectrum from education onwards, but we are ignoring that. We are driving our people into urban society at a huge cost. In the 1960s, housing policy led to huge urbanisation, and society is paying a massive price for it still, for example, in west Dublin, Limerick and other places. This policy of urbanisation is completely wrong because we are leaving behind a massively rich resource. I go back to my two points about the trusted brand and the retail units. We cannot allow them to be lost because they are fundamentally important to communities the length and breadth of the country due to the services they provide as well as the employment they give to postmasters. All the reports have shown it is high time that we route every possible avenue of Government into the post office network. There are units on the high street in every community. They can and will provide a massive service if An Post and its board are fully challenged and told they are charged with making these offices viable, not closing them and saying they are no longer viable or cutting the salaries of postmasters and postmistresses. If they are challenged directly and told it is their job to make these commercially viable, I guarantee they will have to step up to the plate, but only if it is put fairly and squarely on their shoulders to make them commercially viable.

That report analysed Government policy in this area and pointed out there was a clear and imminent danger to the post office network, which is what has created the headlines in recent days. Even if Government policy made financial sense, which patently it does not, then surely there is another dimension, namely, the social dimension. Life is not just about economics. The banks have closed branches in all our major towns because their focus is economics. Surely our focus has to include the social dimension. As has been said, the post office network is a fundamental part of the social and community fabric of this country. It has contributed in no small measure to the stability we have as a society and a country. It is inescapable that the social welfare contract, and the NTMA contract to a lesser extent, are essential to the immediate survival of the post office network. The ambiguity and uncertainty created by the Government in regard to those two contracts does not engender confidence that it is genuinely committed to the future of the post office network. The Minister said that An Post has won the contract for a period of six years. It has not. It has won the contract for a period of two years, but what happens in two years time? There is total uncertainty. The Department of Social Protection seems hell-bent on closing the post office network. It wants 75% of transactions to be electronic by 2017 regardless of whether the post office network can comply with that. More than that, certain sections of the Department of Social Protection have been writing to its customers, trying to bully them and force them to avail of the services of the banks and bypass the post office. While I do not have time to read the correspondence on that into the record, I can make it available to the Minister. I have brought this up on numerous occasions with the Minister for Social Protection and she shows not the slightest interest or inclination to do anything about it. It is a peculiar situation where the Minister for Justice and Equality can call in the Garda Ombudsman, over whom he has no jurisdiction and who is answerable to Parliament, and demand answers, whereas the Minister for Social Protection cannot call in the people who are directly responsible to her - her own staff - and ask them why they are directly flouting Government policy.If the programme for Government is policy, it is Government policy to protect and enhance the current post office network. I am frankly bemused as to why the Government is opposing this motion. It is written in black and white and is the last paragraph in the communications section of the programme for Government. All the motion is doing is asking the Government to implement a promise it solemnly made and entered into as one of the fundamental parts of its contract with the people. It is there in the programme for Government so let us get on with it and give the people of this country some sense of confidence that the Government is interested in helping them maintain their communities.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	I am absolutely shocked that the Government has decided to show its lack of interest in and support for the post office network by amending the motion. The motion before us tonight is very simple. It is a call to action by postmasters and citizens of rural Ireland that asks the Government to wake up to the reality of rural decline. It calls for a plan to be put in place to save the post office network, thereby underpinning the basic infrastructure necessary to keep our rural villages alive and preserving and protecting the basic services that are necessary if rural communities are to survive. The Government's decision beggars belief. This is a non-contentious motion. It is a cry for help and is being met with a slap in the face delivered by Fine Gael and Labour. I fail to understand how rural Government Deputies can traipse in here tomorrow evening and refuse to support this motion. They were quick to wrap the rural flag around their shoulders in 2011 but tomorrow night, as they vote down this motion, they will be stoking the blaze of extinction of the post office network and the vibrant rural communities it serves. The post office network is at a crossroads but it can and will survive. However, in order to do so, it needs some support. It needs to be able to support its hinterland and the various enterprises and businesses in its communities but it needs Government intervention and assistance. The Grant Thornton report and the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications underpin the network sustainability. A one-off capital investment plan is vital. Banking services rolled out through An Post are part of that solution and one that I believe is badly needed throughout the country as so-called pillar banks retreat with haste.  I appeal to Labour and Fine Gael Deputies to support the motion without amendment. They will be supporting rural communities' lifestyles and voters. By voting down this motion, they will be casting aside those communities, this lifestyle and those citizens.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	302	I have been a postmaster since 2003 and I am proud to be one. This Private Members' motion was framed in a constructive manner and is non-contentious. Quite frankly, I am surprised the Government decided to table an amendment to it. Quite simply, it is asking the Government to honour a commitment it made in its programme for Government to ensure the sustainability of the post office network. The Government must acknowledge the fact that 48% of the branch network carries out 11% of business. While the Government talks about An Post being a commercial State company, many of the branches are not commercially viable. There needs to be clear recognition from the Government of the unique and vital social contribution made by the An Post network to the State. It is not just making an economic contribution to the State, but a vital social contribution. It is disingenuous for the Minister to talk about previous reductions in the branch network under the previous Administration. What he failed to admit is that these reductions were voluntary and made at a time when there was huge investment in the computerisation of the post office network and certain people did not choose to have their operations computerised. The facts speak for themselves. An independent report from Grant Thornton cited clear examples of how State services could be provided through the post office network while, at the same time, saving the State money. It is amazing that three years into the lifetime of this Government, it now talks about a whole-of-government approach. Why did it take three years, the spreading of fear and anxiety into the people in the communities served by the post office network and the Irish Postmasters' Union having to come to Leinster House to protest for the Minister to sit up and take note of what needs to be done?  If we look at the record so far, the driving licence debacle was framed in such a way that it was disadvantageous for An Post to tender for that service. When the Minister spoke about the broadcasting fee a few short months' ago, he said that Revenue did a good job collecting the household charge so it might collect the broadcasting fee. Government Deputies and the Minister have alluded to the fact that An Post won the contract to provide the service on behalf of the Department of Social Protection. It did, but what is the Department now doing? It is writing to all recipients of social welfare payments advocating that they get their money paid electronically into their bank account. We have the farcical situation where Government Deputies come in here and call on the Department to cease this practice. They are in government. Never mind calling on it, they should instruct the Department to cease this practice and honour the tender that has been won. They should work with the Irish Postmasters' Union and the various agencies to ensure that they honour the commitment made in the programme for Government and support the many communities the length and breadth of this country both urban and rural to ensure we retain the sustainability of the post office network. In my short time in this House, I have never been contacted so frequently by phone, e-mail or post than by people who are extremely worried that the future of their post office, which is the heart of their community, is not safe as long as this Government is in power.

He talks about the whole-of-government analysis, which appears to be a good idea, but where is the urgency here? Why was this not announced and set up when the report from the Oireachtas committee was issued? I would be concerned not only if I was a postmaster or somebody working in or using a post office locally, but if I was a businessperson on the high street of a small town or village to hear that the commercial and trading businesses are moving out of small rural towns into supermarkets based in larger county and provincial centres. Where does that leave my small town and small towns around me because this is State-sponsored migration of business and people will surely follow? Communities have suffered the loss of many services over the past number of years. The closure of schools, banks, Garda stations and local businesses has resulted in a reduction in infrastructure and identity for communities. The loss of these services, coupled with emigration, has meant that the heart has been ripped out of many communities. The post office network is part of the fabric of many communities in cities, towns and especially in rural areas. Therefore, the protection of the post office network should be viewed as a vital and intrinsic part of the campaign to hold our local communities together. Our post office network should perhaps be considered and renamed the public services access network. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, I was part of the working group that drafted a report on the future of our post office network. It laid out a number of recommendations as to how the post office network should be made viable. Given the social benefit of personal contact that exists between post office staff and their customers, the committee recommended that other Government services be made available through the post office network. Considering the isolation that can exist in our society today, especially among older people and in rural Ireland, it seems appropriate that Government services should be moved to a facility that people are comfortable with and have confidence in. These payments could include motor tax renewals, hospital charges, business rates, rents and other Government payment services. It is also important that communities be given adequate notice of their local post offices being in danger of closure. This news has been sprung on communities too often, leaving it too late to reverse the decision. The Oireachtas report suggests that an amber light warning system be put in place to alert local areas that their post offices are at risk of closure and to allow communities to respond. It is clear that the social welfare contract is vital for the survival of the post office network. As highlighted by a Grant Thornton report, if the social welfare contract was lost, more than 550 post office closures could be expected. Even if the social welfare contract was kept at a reduced rate, there would be well over 400 post offices at risk of closure. To maintain the post office network, the full retention of the social welfare contract is necessary. We should also remember that An Post set up and successfully ran the national lottery at a profit, yet it was taken from An Post by the Government. There is an onus on the Government to work with An Post to develop a post office network that is efficient and of maximum benefit to the community it serves. The programme for Government agreed by Fine Gael and Labour almost three years ago stated: "We will ensure that the network of post offices around the country is maintained and that communities have access to adequate postal services in their locality". It is time for the Government to live up to this commitment and ensure that the post office network is maintained. There is also an onus on An Post to examine its business model. I agree with the Minister's suggestion that it could usefully meet, for example, the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, to explore a mutually beneficial arrangement to make credit union services more easily accessible by members. This is all the more vital as local bank branches close down. Neither the Government, society nor An Post can or should attempt to halt electronic communications or electronic funds transfers, EFTs, although it is disturbing to hear stories of people being forced by the Department of Social Protection to nominate bank accounts. However, we have a nationwide post office structure and a trusted brand with easy access for citizens. In many cases, it is one of the few public service facilities available to locals. The post office network and this Technical Group motion deserve and should receive all of our support.
