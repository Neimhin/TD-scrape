          <p eId="para_41">Currently, any approved sporting body qualifies for exemption from capital gains tax where the proceeds are used for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports.  The new section to be inserted ensures that a gain by any approved sporting body will continue to get the capital gains tax exemption if a portion of the gain is paid to a charity.  However, the body must apply to the Minister for Finance for approval to make the deduction and must specify the charity concerned.  The Minister will have the power to refuse to grant the exemption if he or she does not believe the public good would be served by the donation being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">The new section also provides that the proceeds of a disposal made by an approved sporting body must be expended within a period of five years.  However, an extension of the five-year period is provided for where the body concerned can show it is in the process of using the proceeds for the charity for sporting purposes.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">This amendment proposes to substitute a new section for section 65 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The first part of the new section does the same as the provision that it is replacing, that is, it confirms the budget increase in the tobacco products tax on cigarettes and tobacco generally.  When the rate of VAT applicable on budget day is included, this amounted to 25 cent on a packet of cigarettes in the most popular price category, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for other tobacco products.  The increases are expected to yield an additional €34.3 million in tobacco products tax, and an additional €6.6 in VAT this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The second part of the replacement section provides for a rebalancing of the component elements of the tax on cigarettes, without altering the overall rate, and also introduces a minimum amount of tobacco products tax payable on cigarettes.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The tobacco products tax on cigarettes is made up of a fixed amount, known as the specific component, and an amount related to the sale price of the cigarettes, known as the <i>ad valorem</i> component.  A member state can decide on the balance between these two elements of the tax, within limits laid down by the governing EU directive.  It is now proposed, availing of a greater discretion that has been given to member states, and taking account of the established approach here of emphasising the specific component, to rebalance the structure of cigarette taxation in favour of that component.  That means that the way that the tax on cigarettes is expressed will change from €192.44 per 1,000 and 18.03% of the selling price to €233.11 per 1,000 and 9.04% of the selling price.  This will not, however, change the actual amount of tax charged on cigarettes in the most popular price category.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">The section will also introduce a minimum amount of tobacco products tax payable on cigarettes, bringing the Irish practice into line with that in almost all other EU member states.  This means that, irrespective of the price at which cigarettes are sold, the amount of tobacco products tax paid on them cannot be lower than €268.14 per 1,000.</p>

I reiterate, many of the changes are editing and restructuring changes in preparation for the excise consolidation Bill, such as the deletion of redundant and overlapping provision, repositioning of provisions and rewording for greater clarity.  However, there are also some developments and improvements to the provisions concerned.  This amendment concerns chapter 1, the general excise law part, which contains the general provisions for liabilities, payment and repayment and for the authorised warehousekeepers and registered consigners who are responsible for the excise duty on excisable products held and consigned by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The provisions for the liability of authorised warehousekeepers and registered consigners for the excise duties on the consignments made by them are amended to clarify that the liability is satisfied where the consignment has been properly completed.  Provision is made for estimation of the excise liability for a period covered by an outstanding return.  As with VAT and other taxes, an estimate must be made within four years of the end of that period and a similar time limit is set down for the making of excise assessments.  The provisions for interest to be paid on unpaid excise duties are amended in order that they apply to amounts wrongly repaid to a taxpayer.  This is consistent with other taxes, including VAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The section also provides a relaxation of the requirement for some authorised warehousekeepers who receive consignments of mineral oil by sea to provide a bond guarantee to cover the excise duty concerned.</p>

These powers are provided for in customs law but it is more appropriate to state it here where the other excise powers and provisions are set out.

          <p eId="para_261">My starting position on the question of powers of the Revenue Commissioners is they should be given whatever powers they require to enforce the taxation legislation of the State and I have no difficulty with additional powers being given to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">On the issue of compliance with the excise requirements for tobacco, it has always been a mystery to me how illicit tobacco is allowed to be sold openly on the street.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the enforcement activity of the Revenue in this area is robust enough?  Clearly, the Exchequer forfeits significant excise revenue and there are various estimates of the amount involved.  I do not get the sense that there is an overarching drive by Revenue to tackle the issue in a robust way.  I assume that these additional powers are designed to beef up the resources and tools the agency has to tackle this issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_263">The powers conferred by the amendment are specific to postal packaging, which is another means through which this kind of illegal activity can occur.  The Deputy is correct to point out the enormous loss to the State as a result of this activity.  Since mid-2010, Revenue has conducted a series of nationwide intensive tobacco blitz-type operations concentrating additional resources at ports, airports and selected inland retail points, including markets, for the purpose of identifying and seizing illicit tobacco products.  To date, Revenue has conducted nine such operations resulting in the seizure of 34.6 million cigarettes and significant volumes of tobacco.  These intensive operations are additional to the agency's ongoing day-to-day operations targeting illicit tobacco products.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Much of this relates to cost.  It becomes a self-defeating prophecy.  The more tax applied to tobacco, the greater the prize for those involved in illegal trafficking to present at ports and airports and to use their network to engage in this activity.  There is also a consequential loss to legal traders who pay the full excise on this product.  We are conscious of this issue, which Revenue is taking seriously.  These blitz-type operations will continue and the amendment is a clarification that the powers extend to parcels and packages.  The Revenue Commissioners have sought this amendment and they would not seek it if they did want it but it can only come into being if we pass it.  Some 7 million cigarettes were seized in the post last year.  It does not talk about cartridges - I am sorry, Deputy Doherty.  Maybe we will have to start looking for those.  There were 57 convictions for selling and 103 convictions for smuggling, so obviously there is a lot of work going on, because there is a lot of money to be made from this.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">That was the question I asked last night.  I was trying to get ahead of the Deputy.  My understanding is that over a period of years, we have been consolidating large tranches of our tax law and that a new consolidation of legislation for excise is due at some point in the not too distant future.  That would be the primary consolidation legislation.  In order for the laws to be updated, however, it is still required that we do these things in the normal Finance Bill.  There is a certain repositioning, one could argue, in other legislation.  As I said to Deputy McGrath, the Revenue Commissioners need these powers.  Traditionally this has been achieved through the Finance Bill but, as I understand it, when the consolidated legislation on excise comes before the House - I am not sure whether it includes this - that will be another tranche of tax law that we have consolidated.  There has been an effort over the past number of budgets to do this in specific areas, and the understanding is that excise will be the next area to require standalone consolidation legislation.</p>

A provision for the application of customs law and other excise law to alcohol product tax is to be deleted.

The amendment also provides for the repositioning in the alcohol products chapter of provisions for relief on alcohol product tax for alcohol products held on a ship or aircraft arriving from another member state and for alcohol products that are delivered for use as stores on board a ship or aircraft on a foreign journey.  These reliefs have been provided for under general excise law.  There is also some rewording of provisions for greater clarity and consistency.

I do not believe many of these things that are presented as environmental taxes are anything other than revenue-gathering exercises which further penalise low and middle-income families.  These taxes are misconceived, and this is the responsibility of the current and previous Governments; it was the Green Party that started the ball rolling.  I do not think the revenue is used to clean up our environment, which is something the State will have to take a different and more proactive role in.

          <p eId="para_374">This gives application to the increase so if this was not done, the full cost would be €80 million and it would need to be found elsewhere.  In the current budgetary climate where we must raise revenue, that would have to be offset elsewhere.  There is also a commitment in the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding to consider increases in carbon tax as part of the broadening of the tax base, as we discussed yesterday.  Increasing carbon tax by €5 means a relatively small increase spread across all fossil fuels, rather than larger increases in the excise rates on specific fuels such as petrol and diesel.  The carbon tax will not be applied to home heating fuels until after this winter period, from 1 May 2012.  While tax increases are unpopular, where member states are under fiscal pressure, as we are, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise.  In this instance, a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels, such as coal and peat, remains subject to a ministerial commencement order.  In the context of the overall impact the budgetary measure will have on households, the Government decided to apply carbon tax to coal and peat at this point.  The net issue is that the section gives application to the increase which will amount to around €80 million.  We regard that as crucial if we are to reach the budgetary  position we have set out and to make sure other taxes do not apply but I appreciate it is a difficult situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">The Minister of State said this was about broadening the tax base but it will not do that, it will simply increase the tax liability on individuals who are already paying.  The increase is substantial in percentage terms, about 25% of an increase to raise this €80 million.  Has the Department examined the consequences of the increase and the impact it will have on fuel poverty?  Has there been any engagement with those who are trying to address fuel poverty?  There are no alleviating measures whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">What impact will this have on small and medium enterprises?  We continually hear about the need to foster and support small and medium enterprises but if we talk to SMEs, they will say they are being crippled by all the different charges and the cost of energy is at the top of that list along with rates and rent.  Has the Department considered the impact the measure will have on the SME sector?</p>

          <p eId="para_378">Combined with the cuts in the fuel allowance, this will lead to more winter deaths, which are rising as it stands.  It is little consolation to the many elderly in particular who are already freezing because they cannot afford adequate fuel during the winter, that this increase will not happen until next year on top of all the increases that have already taken place.  This is misconceived and will lead to more suffering.  There are always choices and we have spoken many times about what we think the alternative is, to tax those who can afford it and who will not be shivering in the cold in the winter.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">They are being taxed and they will continue to be taxed, I assure the Deputy of that.  The dilemma is that if we tax them according to Deputy Boyd Barrett's system, we would still not cover the difference between expenditure and revenue.  They would then leave; they would be taxed in the first year but they would then head off the following year because the difference is so great we simply cannot do it with the numbers there.  That is the sort of Alice in Wonderland playground some people like to pretend is an option.</p>

          <p eId="para_383">The public see through it.  On Deputy Doherty's amendment, we have information on the effect on households and we anticipate that it will amount to less than €1 of an increase per bill, presuming bills are on a bimonthly basis.  It is a small increase, although I accept it can have an impact on those on a low income.  We do not have information on the business side but we will try to get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The Deputy asked if anyone was feeding into this strategy across Government.  I refer to the affordable energy strategy launched by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on 27 November that set out the overarching policy of Government to reduce energy, make homes more efficient and put the necessary supports in place for poorer households to become more energy efficient.  The better energy programme has stimulated the upgrade of 150,000 homes.  Last year, €90 million was dispersed in grants for energy efficiency, which included the upgrading of almost 70,000 homes across all schemes and directly supported about 6,000 new jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The warmer homes programme aims to provide energy efficiency improvements to low income homes unable to afford the cost of implementing such measures.  More than 20,000 homes benefited from retrofitting measures in 2011 and the target for 2012 is in excess of 17,000 homes.  At one level, on the carbon side, there is a requirement on the State to reduce dependency and taxation is one measure but the bigger issue is how do we continue to invest in the retrofitting of homes and making them more energy efficient.  The Government is very conscious of this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">This will bring in €80 million.  It affects businesses as well.  If it just impacted on houses, the average figure would be €50 per house, based on the idea that theoretically the household charge will bring in €160 million.  How many businesses will come under this?  If 160,000 business units were included, it would amount to €25 per unit, if business units are charged the same.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">I do not accept the argument.  It is dishonest to suggest that this is an environmental charge.  It is called a carbon tax and the implication is that it will reduce carbon emissions.  It affects people's ability to heat their homes or run their business, although my concern is primarily about the immediate impact of people using less fuel and freezing as a consequence of the combined effect of this, the cuts in the fuel allowance and other cuts in the incomes of vulnerable sectors of our society.  It is not likely to have any substantial impact on the environment and in so far as it does, it is at the expense of human suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">If the Minister is serious about retrofitting, I can make a suggestion which I have put to a number of Ministers but to which I have received no response.  It is a simple suggestion that is fiscally neutral, which should be attractive to the Minister.  It came from a constituent in Meath - which is not my constituency - and it is that we should set up a system where loans would be extended to people to retrofit their homes and the repayments on those loans would match the reduction in their fuel bills.  In other words, it would not cost them anything.  If one gets a 25% reduction in the cost of heating one's home as a result of the house being retrofitted, for example, the repayments would be linked to that saving.  It therefore does not cost any more.  That would also act as a significant stimulus to the construction industry, which would carry out the retrofitting.  Perhaps the Minister might consider it.  If there was real movement on retrofitting, it would be far more beneficial for the environment than simply increasing what is, in effect, another revenue raising exercise.  The Minister admitted as much when he said it is about the €80 million.  It is not about the environment, but let us do something serious about the environment.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_401">In page 134, subsection (1), between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_402">"(<i>f</i>) in section 133 by substituting the following for “new vehicle”:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_403">" ‘new vehicle' means a vehicle that has not previously been registered or recorded on a permanent basis—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_404">(<i>a</i>) in the State under this Chapter or, before 1 January 1993, under any enactment repealed or revoked by section 144A or under any other provision to like effect as this Chapter or any such enactment, or</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_405">(<i>b</i>) under a corresponding system for maintaining a record for vehicles and their ownership in another state,</p>

          <p eId="para_407">This amends the definition of a "new vehicle".  In May 2011 the Commission followed up on its infringement proceedings against Ireland - the reference number is 1995 - 5321 which I presume is the number of the infringement - by informing us that it was of the opinion that the definition of a "new vehicle" contained in the vehicle registration tax, VRT, legislation would not be appropriate to make a distinction between new and used vehicles, that is, for establishing the point from which the real wear and tear of used vehicles must be taken into account.  While a response has been provided, it has been indicated at an informal meeting with Commission officials that without a change to the definition in our legislation, the case will proceed to the European Court of Justice.  To avoid a potential adverse judgment, this amendment changes the definition to be more compliant with the European treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">This refers to what is a new or used vehicle.  It relates to the amount of mileage that can be on a clock before it is decided.  In other words, when a vehicle goes from one country to another the question is whether it is new at the point of leaving the factory or at the point it is first registered.  If there are more than 3,000 km on the clock, it had an effect on the definition.  There are proceedings against Ireland about this.  Changing the definition here would make those proceedings more difficult and bring it more in line with European law.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">We have had an extensive debate on the Government's decision to increase the higher rate of VAT by 2%.  I do not propose to rehears that debate.  However, the early preliminary indications from the retail sales from January, as the Minister is aware, indicates a continuing weakness in the domestic economy.  The figures were disappointing showing a 3.7% reduction in volume terms in January.  The notes issued by various analysts point to the 2% VAT increase as a contributory factor in the weakness in retail sales.  I acknowledge the VAT increase was provided for in the memorandum of understanding with the EU and the IMF, signed up to by the previous Government for 2013 and 2014, but was frontloaded to 2012 by the Government as a political decision.  Time will tell whether the gamble has paid off.  Clearly, the move has greatly assisted the Government in achieving its budgetary targets, at least in theory.  Whether they are achieved remains to be seen because it will take several months of VAT returns before we know.  We remain of the view that it was the wrong decision at a time when consumer sentiment is depressed, the domestic economy is on the floor and when retailers hoped for a boost in the budget.  We now have to deal with a 2% increase in the standard rate of VAT.  My party has made those points already but I wanted to put them on the record.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_472">The Minister of State will be well aware of Sinn Féin's position on a VAT increase.  VAT is an indiscriminate form of tax and affects people on a low income.  The Minister of State can argue that food is exempt and so on.  If one looks at recent results one can see that people are making adjustments in their homes and are spending less.  For example, people spend less on clothing that is subject to the 23% VAT increase.  It is not just luxury items as the Government would have us believe.  If one buys a pair of shoes or rain jacket both are subject to 23% VAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The increase has had a huge effect on the retail sector.  Again wearing my county hat, the measure has had a detrimental impact on retail activity in Border counties and communities.  I did not agree with the previous Government's proposal to increase the VAT by 1% this year and 1% the next year.  We should not increase the tax like that because it does not take account of a person's ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I will give an example and ask the Minister of State to consider it on Report Stage where we will have an opportunity, and Sinn Féin signals its intention, to oppose the section then.  Last week I met the management of Letterkenny General Hospital who explained their budget to me and its €12 million deficit and how they will find it impossible to breach it, narrow or bring it into balance.  One of the substantial costs incurred by the hospital is on junior doctors.  The hospital cannot get junior doctors to apply for a post.  The management has signalled that there will be a problem filling junior doctor posts again this year because the hospital is peripheral.  Junior doctors prefer to go to larger hospitals that have more specialities and so on.  The problem is that the hospital must employ junior doctors through agencies and pay the junior doctor, an agency fee and now 23% VAT on top of that.  The sums are substantial in terms of the hospital's budgeting. It is forced to rely on so many junior doctors being supplied by agencies, yet the VAT bill imposed on it is 23% which does not make sense.  The move is circular because the State funds the hospital in order to pay wages to junior doctors, the hospital then pays the agency and pays VAT on that sum and then it goes back to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Public hospitals should be exempt from VAT when paying agencies for health professionals.  Such a move would immediately alleviate hospitals that cannot recruit junior doctors.  I am not arguing on behalf of all agency workers.  Letterkenny General Hospital has developed a successful programme to attract South African junior doctors and it has also been to Canada and elsewhere.  No matter how well it tries to directly recruit junior doctors it has had to consistently rely on agency doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I ask the Minister of State to take my comments on board and to find a way, under the VAT laws, to exempt hospitals from VAT when paying for necessary health professionals supplied by agencies.  Given that it would be a circular payment an exemption would not make a difference to the headline figures for the State but it would make a huge difference to hospitals when they are allocated a budget.  The payment of VAT by them is unfair.  A larger hospital has more disciplines and is more attractive due to being in a more urban setting, although I will always argue that Donegal is the best place to visit and live.  Sometimes agency doctors from other countries have not discovered the beauty of Donegal and go to an urban centre instead.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I offer that as an example.  Other areas will be hit by the VAT increase, not just domestic individuals or consumer spending.  It is places like hospitals that will have to pay more money and incur a cost.  When Letterkenny General Hospital must pay an additional 2% for its agency doctors that means some operations are cancelled.  It is as simple as that.  The hospital has a €12 million deficit and an increase in VAT will impose that kind of decision on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">I object to the section.  A VAT increase of 2% is an easy way to raise €670 million but it is not a fair way.  I ask the Minister of State to consider my two points.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_480">When a tax increases it will not lead to an increased demand.  There was a lot of opposition to the VAT increase, particularly in the retail sector which has suffered gravely around the country.  Notwithstanding that the increase will have an impact initially I hope it will not affect retail and demand over time.  It is important that the Government does not have a knee-jerk reaction.  Perhaps VAT could be reduced after the first quarter or half year results are released.  Over a period, be it a year or more, we should keep VAT under continuous review and I am sure that we will.  If the increase has a negative impact over a long period the Government will review it and replace it with a different form of taxation so we would get the same amount of money in direct taxation rather than this VAT increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">It is important to give this time to settle.  One fault I have noticed over the years is that when a measure is introduced there is a knee-jerk reaction and the process stops or is reversed.  Let it settle and see how it works over time.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_98" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_482">There has been much debate on this issue because it is a key aspect of the Budget Statement budget announcement.  It is hoped that the measure will raise over €670 million in revenue so it is a key part of the budget's arithmetic.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Deputy Timmins made an important point.  We must examine the scheme for a year. We cannot base a policy on one month, two months or even a quarter of a year when we know that there is enormous fluctuating factors between one quarter and the next.  For instance, if one looks at last year, there was great optimism in the first two quarters and it seemed that we had finally pushed through this downturn but then recovery was held back by the international gloom that followed from the summer of last year.  It is far too early to give a definitive view on the impact of the measure on the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I wish to make a political point.  When in opposition I and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the then opposition spokesperson on finance, were very clear.  In our pre-budget submission that we published in December 2010, when Deputy Michael McGrath's party was in Government, we highlighted this issue as being important to us on the basis that we all accept the necessity for additional revenue.  It was crucial to our election platform and to the programme for Government that we would not increase tax on work.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The key driver, in terms of the economy and trying to get economic growth back, must be to keep the 1.8 million people at work and create incentives so that we are not taxing people inordinately.  As much as 80% of the adjustments in the previous two years were done using the taxation system, either through the universal social charge and tax credits and on the tax side, although not so much through tax rates.  Admittedly, the Government had to do a lot of that because to get the money in quickly one has got to change the tax rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">We were very consistent, when coming to office, that we wanted to stimulate economic growth and activity. We wanted to make sure that it was still in people's economic interest to work in circumstances where the top marginal rate of tax now is effectively 41% plus another 11% between the USC and PRSI.  We were clear in our pre-budget submission that we would increase it from 21% to 23%.  Deputy McGrath's party in office signed off on a memorandum of understanding that it would increase it from 21% to 23%, admittedly over two years.  This was well flagged in a circumstance where there had been a substantial rise in tax in the three previous budgets in that three-year period.  It also came out in the campaign.  I believe the Chairman's party attacked us on it also during the campaign but we were up-front about what we wanted to do on the basis that we did not want to increase the headline rate of tax, the bands and the credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I do not like developing policy based on the "I met a man last week" principle but when the budget was announced I met a man in my constituency who made a useful observation.  He said that direct taxes will not increase next year, which I confirmed, and that what one had last year is what one will have this year.  He said that is important because he knew what he wanted to spend his money on next year and he now had some certainty in terms of what he will have.  That is important in trying to provoke some improved domestic circumstance where we all accept the domestic economy is as flat as a pancake.  If people have certainty as to the amount they are bringing home on a monthly or weekly basis they can organise their affairs over a 12 month basis because they have stability in terms of their take-home pay.  That could not have happened if we did not increase indirect taxation in the manner set out in the budget.  It simply was not possible to do it on any fair basis, and that is something we hope to continue.  We have made a commitment in the programme for Government not to increase the rates, the bands or the credits.  I said yesterday that it would be a foolish Minister for Finance who would make that prediction into the future but, ultimately, that is the commitment of the Government and it is something we believe is important in trying to support economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I would point to ongoing OECD research which shows that increases in indirect taxation are less harmful to economic growth than increases in direct income taxation or work taxation.  That is fairly well accepted internationally, particularly in a circumstance where we are coming out of an extraordinary slump during which we lost about 15% of GDP over a three-year period and the economy has seen an inordinate rise in unemployment.  Economic growth is the key to getting the country back on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">My understanding also is that 51% of all goods and services are subject to the standard VAT rate.  Deputy Doherty made the point about clothes but children's clothes, footwear and oral medicines are not included.  They are part of the lower rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">He also asked about medical services.  I understand that medical services are exempt from any deductibility.  That is restricted by EU law.  To do that for the junior doctors in Letterkenny about whom Deputy Doherty spoke would not be in compliance with EU law, as we understand it, and is something on which we would be severely reprimanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">If one reads the figures published yesterday one would come to the assumption that there has been a major slump in car sales but what is interesting, and we have this hot off the press, is that on the VRT, which is a fairly good indication of whether moneys have been coming in, the figures for January 2012 show a 0.6% increase from 2011.  The scrappage scheme in place in 2011 was another incentive to sell and transact in the car business.  It may not be as significant, therefore, as yesterday's CSO figures suggested based on our VRT take from January of this year.  As Deputy Timmins said, that is something we will have to review to see its full impact in a full year because months and quarters vary from one degree to the next.</p>

The problem with the Government strategy is that it has maintained the take-home pay of somebody who is earning €25,000 a year but it has also maintained the take-home pay of somebody earning €125,000.  Direct taxation would be less harmful to the economy than indirect taxation.  If the Minister were to apply the direct taxation on the higher end there would be an ability to pay and therefore taking more money out of people's pockets would not result in more money being taken out of the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The problem is with indirect taxation.  If we take the person who is earning €25,000 a year, the Minister of State has maintained their take-home pay but as soon as they get home they are being fleeced.  That is the problem.  We referred earlier to their gas bills increasing, and there is also the household charge and water charges.  If they want to buy a pair of trousers they will have to pay more.  They will have to pay more for home heating oil.  If they are travelling to work they will have to pay more for their petrol or diesel.  Time and again we will see more charges being imposed on them.  They might get some comfort at the end of the week when they see their pay is the same but the reality is that their disposable income will be reduced.  People want to know what their disposable income will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The question is not just whether that is fair because in my view what has been done in terms of VAT increases is deeply unfair.  In fairness to the Fine Gael Party, it was up-front in bringing forward clear proposals to increase VAT by 2% but on this occasion I agree with the Labour Party that every little increase hurts, and this is one of the measures that hurt but it will not hurt everyone.  A 2% increase in VAT will not make any difference to many people.  The problem is that when VAT is increased by 2% it not only affects people who have the ability to absorb it but also those who do not have the ability to absorb it.  Referring back to what I spoke about earlier, we hear calls to radio shows or directly from people in our clinics that they only heat one room in the house.  That might be a mother with young children.  In terms of disposable income some people say they have only €5 to survive on for a week.  All of this is increasing those pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The Minister said the domestic economy is flat.  The domestic economy is worse than flat.  If we are to believe the Central Bank report we will see the domestic economy shrink by another 0.7%.  The export figures, and the multinationals, are masking what is really happening in the domestic economy.  If the Central Bank's projections come to pass we will still be in a deep recession.  This was a policy platform for Fine Gael but given that our domestic economy has been shrinking in recent years it should decide to examine areas that do not involve taking money out of people's pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">As for the Government taking money from the pockets of those with incomes of €20,000 or even more, such individuals spend all their money each year on goods and services, mortgages and child care.  There is no chance that individuals who are paid €20,000 to €30,000 per year are able to save a large tranche of money in a bank account as they spend everything they get in the domestic economy.  If more money is taken from them through VAT, they will spend less and as a result, small and medium-sized enterprises will suffer more.  As a consequence, such enterprises will reduce the number of staff they have or the hours they work, which in turn will put more pressure on the social welfare bill.  In addition, it will contract their businesses and make it more difficult for them to recover.  I acknowledge there is an ideological difference between my party and Fine Gael on this matter-----</p>

          <p eId="para_512">To clarify, Deputy Doherty twice referred to VAT on home heating oil.  I understand the rate of VAT charged on home heating oil is 13.5% and therefore the increase in VAT has no impact on it.  The Minister of State might confirm this for me.  However, to follow on from the point, perhaps the Government should give consideration to a third rate of VAT for necessities.  Perhaps there should be a lower VAT rate for necessities than the 13.5% rate that applies to oil at present.  As for luxury goods, I am unsure whether any goods currently in the 13.5% band rate could be moved to the 23% band but perhaps a third or fourth rate of VAT could be put in place.  While I acknowledge this entails more work administratively, perhaps consideration should be given to creating a category of necessities such as home heating oil or other basic goods.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">This has been the first regressive budget for a number of years and was part of an austerity budget that indicates to me a clear move from the centre to the right.  In the Dáil, I outlined and went through the numbers of a case concerning the cut being applied to a single mother in Fassaroe, Bray.  I appreciate this committee pertains to finance rather than expenditure but she will experience a cut that is 46 times greater than someone who earns €150,000 and who lives in a wealthier part of the country.  This is absolutely extraordinary and I wish to echo the concerns expressed by Deputy Doherty.  I understand that standard economic policy states one should tax consumption rather than labour and in a steady-state economy, a gradual move from taxing labour to taxing consumption is perceived to be a fairly good thing.  However, under present circumstances, I must object strongly to what, according to the case studies and analysis I have seen, unfortunately is a deeply regressive budget that is ideologically flawed.  The budget suggests that if one wishes to promote jobs, one should not tax labour and, therefore, one should instead make cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">A report emerged from an Italian university in recent weeks that featured in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> over the weekend and I can forward the reference to the Minister of State.  It showed the effect of tax increases on the domestic economy is one third that of cuts.  Unfortunately, in Ireland we appear to be going the other way and as Deputy Doherty noted, this is having an impact on local business.  A prominent businessman in Bray approached me recently.  He runs a shop that has been in the town for more than 100 years and he believes the 2% increase in the VAT rate will put him out of business.  The business has been there for an awfully long time but is hanging on by its fingernails.  The Minister of State will be aware that many business people in his own constituency are in the same position.  This is not a guy who is prone to scaremongering or who habitually visits his local Deputy.  He is a businessman who comes from a trading family in Bray who reckons this is the final straw and that he will be obliged to close down and put everyone out of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">This leads to the second issue I wish to raise.  In recent weeks, I have submitted some parliamentary questions to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and have received conflicting responses.  However, I received the latest response this morning, which pertains to the calculation of the amount and which indicates the full year amount arising from the increase will be €670 million.  The Tánaiste confirmed to me in the Chamber that this was a static estimate.  It was calculated simply by multiplying by 0.2 the total value of the goods to which the increase applies, which results in a figure of €670 million.  However, I received a conflicting answer to a parliamentary question from the Minister, Deputy Noonan, which stated that second order effects had been taken into account.  Consequently, I pressed again and asked for the actual analysis.  Not surprisingly, the analysis was not provided to me but I was informed it actually was a static calculation.  Obviously, serious second order effects occur when one increases price, the most obvious being that consumption falls.  It is the entire economic rationale behind the jobs initiative, namely, if one reduces the VAT rate on tourism-related goods, jobs in tourism will increase.  One can make a calculation if one takes fairly conservative assumptions regarding elasticity of consumption versus price, reasonably conservative assumptions in respect of the number of businesses that will close down, such as the aforementioned gentlemen in Bray, and the number of people this will put out of work, as well as the loss in corporation tax receipts.  I am sure the Minister of State is also aware of this point from contacts with businesses in his own constituency but many businesses in County Wicklow, particularly those engaged in the hospitality trade, have indicated they simply will absorb the 2% increase themselves.  They believe they cannot increase prices but will absorb the increase.  A few have stated that as a result, they will be obliged to lay off one person or half a person.  Obviously, however, if such businesses absorb a 2% increase in price and do not pass it on to the consumer, their profits will fall.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">This means this measure will have three major effects.  The first is a fall in consumption, the second is an increase in unemployment and the third is a fall in corporation tax receipts.  I carried out a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation that suggested the cost of these three effects probably will come in at approximately €300 million.  I spoke to Dr. Stephen Kinsella, who has carried out more advanced analysis on this issue, and he arrived at a figure of approximately €350 million.  I am puzzled by this proposal because if these calculations are correct, they could amount to almost one third of the full €1 billion the tax increases are projected to take in.  I would welcome a response from the Minister of State's on that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">The report to which the Deputy refers is the ESRI report.  I will forward a copy of it to the Deputy, which he should read because it does not come to the same conclusions as the Deputy.  It has a review about the regressive nature of the indirect tax increase on which we had a discussion yesterday but the Deputy was not here.  The ESRI takes a different view in regard to whether our taxation system over a period of years has been more or less progressive in terms of the adjustments made.  It does not arrive at the same conclusions arrived at by the Deputy.  The Deputy should read the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_534">The ESRI's switch model is interesting.  In terms of getting that assessment, it makes the point that the biggest adjustment has been on well-off families.  It also had interesting things to say about the elderly in terms of the lack of reduction in that area.  It also makes the point that cumulatively the budgets since the start of the crisis have been more than progressive.  If one looks at the six countries concerned, Ireland is the most progressive in terms of budgets.  I recommend to the Deputy that he read the report and then come back to us on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">I do not accept the ESRI's view on the issue of indirect taxation, which I will explain.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">In regard to any decision which a government must take in terms of increased taxes or reductions in expenditure, if a government stops spending then it knows that, say, €1 billion, will not be spent but when it decides on a taxation policy one way or the other it can never be sure how much it will bring in because it is based on human behaviour.  If ever there was an example of this it is in this area, which is based on consumption.  People have the choice to buy or not.  In trying to make adjustments last, a government is probably better off trying to do more on the expenditure side than on the tax side because it can then be certain about whether it can spend money.  The position is not as clear when it comes to taxation, in particular in an economy like ours, which is recovering following an enormous drop from the edge of a cliff.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I do not agree with Deputy Doherty.  Neither I nor the Minister for Finance said at any stage in our contributions that this budget does not introduce increases in taxation because there have been increases in taxation.  The Government made the decision, in an attempt to keep people at work and to incentivise them to work, to not increase direct income taxation.  I admit there are increases in taxation in many areas, as there will be during the course of the next few years.  Achieving a budget deficit of 3% will require a number of budgets which increase tax and reduce expenditure.  That is as obvious as the nose on one's face.  There is no other way of achieving that target.  I am not pretending to people that there have been no tax increases because there have been but the decisions the Government has taken in terms of this budget attempt to avoid harming economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I agree with the Deputy that this is about disposable income.  It is about how much money people have in their pockets at the end of the week or month in terms of spending in the real economy.  Deputy Donnelly is correct that significant discount pricing is going on on the high street, be it in Bray, Greystones or any constituency.  This is an understandable reaction in a circumstance where the domestic economy is difficult.  This has been factored into our proposal.  Discount pricing and the sales phenomena is occurring everywhere, in terms of buying goods and services by the consumer.  Prices are reducing and rightly so because for many years the consumer was being ripped off.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">We will see how we go this year.  Our estimate is €650 million.  Deputy Donnelly has suggested that the €1 billion euro tax take we are expecting could be down by one third.  We will see whether we hit the targets set out in the budget.  The hospitality sector is subject to VAT at 9%.  It is not affected by this increase.  As I said earlier, 51% of all goods and services are subject to the standard rate of VAT.  Many of these goods and services are purchased by choice.  A consumer has a choice in terms of deciding whether to buy a good or service, to which is attached a 23% VAT rate.  This gives the people choice in terms of certainty of disposable income between now and end December.  Like the Deputy I too would love to be in the position to provide options.  However, the options open to the Government are limited, which I believe the people accept.  The Government must make these choices in the circumstance of our having to achieve an 8.6% of deficit by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Last year, we managed to not only hit our target but to go beyond it, which makes the job of this year slightly easier.  Irrespective of what the Central Bank has said in terms of growth projections for this year, everyone has accepted we can still hit our target of 8.6% even with lower growth in the Irish economy.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Finance will produce its growth forecasts for the end of 2012 in April.  We will wait and see where it goes.  The Deputy asked if I accept that on the totality of €1 billion euro tax take, we will be out by one third.  That is not our assessment of the situation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_545">We may not be out by one third.  I hope we are not.  We know, on the basis that these second order effects, which are fairly standard, that if prices increase consumption will fall by quite a bit.  Why was the analysis, which seems extraordinarily simple, not done?  It seems odd to me, if there is any question of there being €300 million in second order effects, that the analysis was not done.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I would like to reply to the Minister of State's statement that every time money is taken out of an economy, it is a regressive step.  Let us be clear, every time one takes money out of an economy, it is not regressive.  It is how one takes money out of an economy that determines whether it is progressive or regressive.  In a situation where a single mother with four children in Bray has to take a cut which is 46 times that taken by someone earning €150,000, it is reasonable to say that the budget under which it was introduced is a regressive budget.  Would the Minister of State, therefore, accept that it is not taking money out of an economy that is regressive rather it is how one takes it out that determines if it is regressive.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">I will read the note I have on the issue of the €580 million in 2012.  The imposition of a budgetary adjustment package has negative economic implications in the short term in that it takes money out of the economy.  This means that the deficit will not reduce by the full amount of adjustment package implemented.  Let me put it in simplistic terms.  A VAT rate increase, income tax increase or a social welfare rate reduction would all directly or indirectly reduce the amount of money people have to spend, with consequential negative implications for consumer spending and, therefore, tax receipts.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I refer the Deputy to the budget booklet, which was made available on the day the Minister for Finance made his budget statement.  It sets out the impact of the budget on the fiscal position.  It also sets out the impact of new budgetary measures, of which the VAT rate increase is one element, which it is estimated will reduce taxes by €770 million.  In other words, if the full benefit of the budgetary adjustment package is not gained because of negative economic implications in the short run, it is built into the overall budgetary arithmetic.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">This amendment introduces changes to section 123B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 which imposes a levy on ATM and debit cards.  As part of the restructuring of the Irish banking system, my Department has undertaken a review of the options available to reduce financial exclusion.  Financial exclusion is defined by the European Commission as "a process whereby people encounter difficulties accessing and-or using financial services or products in the mainstream market that are appropriate to their needs and enable them to lead a normal social life in the society in which they belong".  There is a high correlation between low income and financial exclusion and it is likely that the majority of those financially excluded are in receipt of welfare benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">In addressing financial exclusion, access to banking and in particular, to transaction banking, that is, the ability to make lodgments and payments through a variety of mechanisms, needs to be the primary priority because it is a key to accessing other financial services.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">A basic payment account is a transaction account which has been designed to meet the needs of the financially excluded.  The provision of a basic payment account is a logical first step in addressing the issue of financial exclusion in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">My Department has been working with the banking industry to make basic payment accounts available to those who are financially excluded and it is expected that such accounts will be made available on a pilot basis shortly and depending on the outcome, these will be extended over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">A basic payment account will meet the following conditions: the account holder will not have used a bank account in the three years prior to opening of the account; all social welfare payments payable to an individual must be paid into the account; and other amounts up to €2,000 in two consecutive quarters can be lodged to the account.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The banks have given a commitment that transaction fees will not be charged to those accounts and I am now providing that the stamp duty levy payable on debit and ATM cards will not apply to a card issued in respect of a basic payment account.    The section effectively excludes people who will shortly have these accounts from paying stamp duty on debit or laser cards.  Clearly, this will be an incentive to use such cards.  We will await the outcome of the pilot scheme.</p>

This amendment, which relates to the levy payable from 1 January 2013, is a technical change to section 91 of the Finance Bill, as initiated, to ensure that, in the case of a person who becomes 18 years of age in an accounting period, only one levy will be chargeable in respect of that person during the year.

          <p eId="para_656">The amendment relates to the proposed reduction in the tax free threshold for capital acquisitions tax in respect of group A transfers.  Having examined the changes that have been made in this area, I note that when the adjustment process commenced in 2008 the group A threshold stood at €542,000.  It has since been reduced in several stages, first to €434,000, then to €414,000 and subsequently to €332,000.  The Minister proposes to further reduce the threshold to €250,000.  My concern is that parents who pass on a modest family home or some savings to a child will come within the ambit of the new capital acquisitions tax regime.  This is a step too far and for this reason I propose reducing the threshold by to €300,000.  The Minister's proposal is excessive, especially when one considers that the threshold stood at €542,000 some years ago.  The proposal would amount to a 54% reduction in this figure, a significant decline which would bring into the net many inheritance transactions that would otherwise have been exempt from capital acquisitions tax.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_189" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_657">The amendment seeks to increase the group A tax free threshold, which applies broadly to gifts and inheritances taken by children from their parents, from €250,000 to €300,000.  The group A tax free threshold was reduced from €332,084 to €250,000 in the budget.  In addition, section 95 rounds up the group B and C tax free thresholds from €33,208 and €16,604 to €33,500 and €16,750, respectively, while breaking the link between the thresholds and the consumer price index.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The budget change reduced the group A tax free threshold from ten times to just under 7.5 times the group B tax-free threshold, which applies broadly to siblings and nephews and nieces.  This is the level of differential that applied until 1999.  Approximately 50% of the capital acquisitions tax yield currently comes from gifts and inheritances in the group B threshold, while approximately 30% of the yield comes from gifts and inheritances in the group A threshold, notwithstanding that gifts and inheritances from parents to children are more common and usually larger than gifts and inheritances in the other categories.  The reduction in the group A threshold rebalances the yield from the tax and is appropriate in light of the continuing decline in asset values.  The revised group A threshold is still significantly in excess of the price of the average house.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The decrease in the group A tax free threshold, together with the increase in the rate of capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax from 25% to 30%, is necessary to raise additional revenue to meet the commitments in the memorandum of understanding with the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund to reform the capital taxation system in 2012, as was set out in the budget.  In light of these commitments to raise additional revenue from capital taxes in 2012 and the dramatic reduction in house prices in recent years, I regret I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  The argument, therefore, is that house prices have declined and the differential between groups A and B has not been dramatically altered as a result of the changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">If the truth be told, we are moving into the area of taxation of property of one description or another.  Should people who obtain significant asset through inheritance pay a little as part of a contribution to resolving our problems?  I believe the answer is "Yes".  If one is moving towards property taxes and taxes on consumption, an issue we discussed before lunch, although one removes pressure on direct taxes on income, one must leave open one's options in the areas of capital taxes and taxes on the disposal of assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">While I do not have a note on the additional yield, it is estimated that the overall yield was €62 million.  I hope I have been of some assistance to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_662">I appreciate the Minister of State's reply and understand from where he is coming.  It is fair and reasonable to expect that people who receive a gift or inheritance make a contribution in the form of taxation.  That is fair and reasonable but there has not been much public discussion or analysis of the changes made in the area.  We have come from a threshold of €542,000 down to €250,000 in the space of three years, notwithstanding the significant drop in property prices.  It represents a fundamental change and, of course, not all assets transferred by way of gift or inheritance are in the form of property, but may be in the form of liquid assets.  For future reference, we should bear in mind there has been a major change in the area and I caution against going any further in the future.</p>

We need a public debate on the responsibility of the State where a substantial gift or inheritance has been made to an individual in respect of where stands the tax code.  It is probably part and parcel of the upcoming question of a viable property tax which is part of the broadening of the base argument that we all have to respond.</p>

Those figures are based on a reply to a parliamentary question received from the Minister.  It is an area we have to look at.  This is a windfall from which people benefit.  Given that there is still €250,000 for category A, when huge amounts of transfers are being gifted to individuals it is appropriate that a higher rate of tax would apply.  The thresholds are important and we may have to look at the issue again if the property prices start to bottom out as expected.  It is an issue for the future.  I would like if the rate had been increased further.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">The matter is being kept under constant review and as the circumstances change all these issues will, I presume, be on the table.  In respect of all capital taxes, we entered into a commitment to bring uniformity to them and to increase them because we recognise it is an area of significant potential that previous Administrations did not tap.  Arguably, doing it at a time when there is such a collapse, the question is whether we will get the yield and the bottom line is to get the yield.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Although we did not get to the Deputy's amendment what I have to say may be of interest as it is on the same issue.  The CAT rate has increased from 20% to 30% since 2008 and the group A tax free threshold is 59% lower than its peak value in 2009.  That is a very substantial change.  Also the capital gains tax, capital acquisition tax and deposit interest retention tax rates have been set at the same level as the effective rate of income tax under the high earners restriction.  In terms of loopholes or potential difficulties, that rate reduction since 2008 is significant.  The issue will be kept under constant review.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_679">In page 157, before section 105, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_680">105.-Section 912A of the Principal Act is amended-</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_681">(<i>a</i> ) in subsection (2) by substituting “902A, 905,” for “902A,”, and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_682">(<i>b</i> ) by substituting the following for subsection (3):</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_683">"(3) Where sections 902A, 905, 907 and 908 have effect by virtue only of this section, they shall have effect as if the references in those sections to-</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_684">(<i>a</i> ) tax, were references to foreign tax, and</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_685">(<i>b</i> ) any provision of the Acts, were references to any provision of the law of a territory in accordance with which foreign tax is charged or collected.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Ireland's international obligations in respect of exchange of information with tax authorities in other countries, with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement or tax information exchange agreements, needs to conform to OECD standards in this area.  To a large extent they do.  However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.  This provision seeks to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">As I mentioned in regard to section 104, it is vitally important to Ireland's reputation in the international tax arena that there be no shadow on our ability to assess and exchange information needed by our double taxation agreement or tax information exchange agreement partners to protect their domestic tax base.  Any perception that Ireland might be non co-operative could be enormously damaging to Ireland's reputation and perception as a willing and responsible participator in the exchange of information between tax administrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">In this context section 912A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applies certain provisions in the Taxes Consolidation Act for the purposes of complying with exchange of information provisions contained in Ireland's double taxation agreements and tax information exchange agreements.  This section is being amended to enable specifically authorised officers of the Revenue Commissioners to use the powers contained in section 905 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, where necessary, for the purposes of obtaining information requested by foreign tax authorities under double taxation agreements or tax information exchange agreements.   The powers available under section 905 can only be used in respect of domestic taxation.  Section 905 enables authorised Revenue officers to enter business premises to inspect documents, search for documents, examine and remove documents for further examination, as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">In addition, when section 912A was enacted it was thought that a foreign tax authority would always be in a position to give the name and-or address of the person in respect of whom information was required.  "Taxpayer" was, accordingly, defined as meaning "a person".  However, experience has shown that the name and address of "a person" might not always be known by a foreign tax authority, although other identifiers may be available, such as an account number.  In such cases, doubts have been expressed that "taxpayer", as defined in section 912A may not apply to an unnamed person.  Accordingly, the definition of taxpayer is being deleted to remove this doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">The select committee looked at a number of taxation agreements in recent months.  It is fair to say that the Department and the Revenue Commissioners were very conscious not only of increasing the number of double taxation agreements, but making sure that they are updated and relevant, and that we comply with the best international standards.  Given the reputational damage we have suffered - I have attended some of the OECD meetings myself - a huge store is put on this.  It adds up to whether a country is seen in a positive light if these exchange agreements are in place and if they are updated.  What we are doing here is bringing the best international practice to bear.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">We currently have 69 double taxation agreements in place.  We have 15 exchange information agreements, but four more are coming on stream, so that makes 19 in total.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">This is in respect of filing of returns to the Revenue Commissioners, which can impose penalties on deliberately false claims and careless claims.  How do we define "careless" and how do we then pursue that?  Recently, I had to make a P35 return for a number of people I employed on a part-time basis.  When I was doing their P60s, I obviously put in the wrong data.  What is "careless"?  That is a very simple thing.  I think the form should be changed, but that is a separate matter.</p>

The question is about what is "careless".  It is set out in the legislation, but we do not have a copy of it in front of us.  However, this section does not change that.  All it does is put the USC component as part of it.  It is not actually changing the fundamental provision on "careless".</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Officials have told me that if the one comes to an agreement, there is no court action.  The Revenue will come to a view as to whether one's bona fides in this are fair and above board.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Conlan</from>
          <p eId="para_718">I note there is no amendment tabled to this section, but I am concerned because this section allows the Collector General the power to require a person carrying out a business to provide security for certain fiduciary taxes, where the taxes are not paid within 30 days of the due date.  This section makes it an offence for a person served with such a notice to engage in business until the security is provided.  I am very concerned that this section could potentially close down a business to which it is applied, and I think the 30 day time limit is too short.  I think it should be extended to 60 or 90 days and I ask the Minister to look at this before Report Stage.  In the meantime, I would like to seek some advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">There may be other sections that prevent people making appeals if they are not fully tax compliant, so that needs to be checked out.  If that is the case, maybe we need to extend the time.  This is a pro-business Government and I would hate to see a situation whereby businesses were shut down because they were not tax compliant for 30 days.  That may not be the intention, but certainly I would not like to see it in legislation, so I ask the Minister of State to look at it.  In the interim, I will consider putting down an amendment on Report Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_232" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_720">I understand that the Deputy has raised this with officials and I would like to put the reply on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The use of this provision will be very restricted and will only apply where the Revenue Commissioners form an opinion, based on past experience and so on, that there is likely to be non-payment of fiduciary taxes by a person.  In essence, we will be targeting phoenix operators.  There is no intention to go after ordinary businesses here.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The Revenue will issue a notice under this section requiring a person to provide security, such as a bond or whatever.  If that person is of the opinion that the issue of the notice is unwarranted and feels that, based on his history and so on, he should not be required to give a security, he can appeal the decision of the Revenue Commissioners.  Presumably, he appeals it to the Appeal Commissioners.  The appeal against the decision of the Revenue Commissioners must be made within 30 days.  This is a standard time limit, and it is unclear why it is suggested that the 30-day limit for making an appeal is too short.  If he appeals, the requirement to provide a security is deferred until the Appeals Commissioner has determined the matter.  We would not be disposed to extending the time for making an appeal, as the purpose of this provision is to protect the Exchequer yield.  It would also mean we would have to wait for an extended period to see whether the person processes the appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">On the second issue raised by Deputy Conlan of whether non-compliant taxpayers can appeal, that is fundamental.  It is true that if one is not tax-compliant with regard to a particular tax area, one cannot submit an appeal against an assessment unless that assessment has initially been complied with.  However, this provision relates to situations in which the Revenue Commissioners considers that a risk exists that fiduciary taxes may not be handed over in the future, so the concern about inability to appeal does not arise.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">This is an interesting section.  The Minister of State might clarify what he means by a phoenix company.

He might elaborate on what types of security the Revenue Commissioners would be seeking.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_726">Okay.  Otherwise it could have implications for a business seeking credit, for example, because if a particular item was given as security it would no longer be available for the purpose of obtaining credit.  Even if a company that is in arrears with regard to its tax obligations has reached an agreement with the Revenue Commissioners and established a repayment schedule, would it still be the intention of the Revenue Commissioners to invoke this section and require a security?  The main issue is that the type of company to which this would apply needs to be clarified.</p>

          <p eId="para_727">A phoenix company is a company that rises from the ashes pretty quickly, leaving a long trail of tax liabilities.  This provision is designed to apply to a group of people who regard themselves as untouchable; they come and go as they please, and consequently we need the powers to do this.  My understanding is that the full import of the provision will only come into being after some consultation with industry sources but we need the power to do this as an ultimate measure if people are not complying.  I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that before this provision is applied, it will publish detailed guidance on the circumstances in which it will be used.  In this regard, the Revenue Commissioners will engage as required with business interests and tax agents with a view to developing clear guidelines on how and when the provision will be invoked.  The view is that this is required by the Revenue Commissioners, but the gun will only be fired when it believes it is appropriate to do so.  This is specifically going after a group of people who are simply not complying.</p>

However, my reading of the Bill leads me to believe that it does not preclude the requesting of such a security from any company that exists.  It is not restricted to a certain type of company.  The legislation allows the Revenue Commissioners to apply this to any business from the local hairdresser to the butcher's shop.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">The Deputy is right in saying the provision could apply, theoretically, to everyone.

          <p eId="para_732">I will give a hypothetical scenario, although it is not so hypothetical because it actually happened.  In my constituency there is a young female entrepreneur who has run a successful business for the last eight years, employing another individual.  The business ran up a tax liability with the Revenue Commissioners which was last year in the region of €1,800.  The Revenue Commissioners passed that on to the local sheriff, who intended to break the door down the seize the assets of the business.  This was for a liability of €1,800 which was as a result of PAYE.  The Revenue Commissioners were threatening to put this individual out of business.  There has been some accommodation but the situation is still difficult.  The business is going through a difficult time because of everything we discussed earlier on, including lack of spending, but the owner is hoping to see it through.  Could the measure we are discussing have been imposed on that business, or does it apply only to new start-up businesses?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_242" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_733">Theoretically it could be imposed but the view is that this is for people who have a track record in this regard.  The business the Deputy refers to may have a liability for one year because of a trading difficulty; it does not have a track record of doing this.  I am informed that the provision would apply to people who have a track record of non-compliance and who walk away from their tax debts.  In the case of the business to which the Deputy refers, the Revenue Commissioners would encourage that person to engage with it to work out some solution.  That person is staying with the business; she is not moving to another business.  This provision is for a group of people who regularly move in and out of businesses and simply walk away from their debts.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">She has been engaging with the Revenue Commissioners for a while.  I agree with the section in principle but is there a way of tightening it up?  At the moment, the Revenue Commissioners probably intends to pursue the provision in the way the Minister of State has said, but there is nothing to stop it being applied in a different way in the future.  A business could run into difficulties for two or three years in terms of its tax liability, which would create a record.  The Revenue Commissioners could impose this security on it even if it was struggling to pay bits and pieces.  The Revenue Commissioners does its job very well in terms of collecting revenue, but if such a security provision was to be introduced, it could close businesses.</p>

          <p eId="para_802">Amendment No. 113 proposes changes to the legislation governing the time limits applying to the repayment of taxes and to the related question of when a repayment of tax may be set off against other tax liabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The background to this measure is that section 865 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is concerned with the repayment of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  Similar provisions are contained in the various other tax codes.  All of these provisions were introduced in the Finance Act 2003 to provide a general statutory right to the repayment of tax together with interest.  The intention behind this general scheme was to provide a clear legislative basis for the repayment of tax that would replace an evolving common law right being developed by the courts on a piecemeal case-by-case basis.  Without such a clear statutory basis for dealing with claims for repayments there were serious Exchequer implications in that tax which has been collected and spent by the State on the basis that it was properly due could, years afterwards, fall to be repaid with interest, thereby undermining current tax revenues and threatening current Exchequer spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The 2003 scheme provided for a general statutory right to repayment in addition to any other existing statutory right under tax law but abolished any existing common law right.  The right to repayment was made subject broadly to a claim being made to the Revenue Commissioners within four years of the end of the period to which the claim related, with interest on a tax free basis paid on repayments at a rate of 4% per annum.  The 2003 scheme also reduced Revenue's right to make and amend assessments to a four-year period in line with the taxpayer's right to repayment, except in certain limited cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Since the introduction of the 2003 scheme the position of the Revenue Commissioners, supported by legal advice, is that if a repayment cannot legally be made to a person because the repayment is claimed outside the four-year limit, there can be no right to offset that repayment against other tax liabilities that might be due by that person, either in the past or in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Revenue's position is founded on legal advice to the effect that in law the existence of a debt that is capable of being repaid is a precondition for any right of offset to apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The position may be summarised as follows.  Where a repayment cannot be made because it is claimed outside the statutory time limit of four years, there is no debt due and, consequently, there is nothing available for offset against other liabilities.  On this basis, Revenue refused claims for repayments of tax to be offset against other tax liabilities where the repayment cannot be made because it is claimed outside the four-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The reason for the amendment, notwithstanding Revenue's position on this issue, is that taxpayers have been seeking to offset time expired repayments against past and current tax liabilities to date.  Revenue has resisted these claims.  However, a clear statutory provision to support the legal advice received by the Revenue Commissioners is needed to bring clarity to the law in this area for all concerned.  Such a provision would also reinforce the policy objectives underpinning the 2003 scheme, namely, to prevent current tax yields from being undermined, either by repayment having to be made years after the tax had been paid or by such repayments being offset against current tax liabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Accordingly, the amendment seeks to confirm in legislation that where a repayment of tax cannot be made because its repayment is claimed outside the four-year period, the tax will not be available for offset against any other tax liabilities, with one exception.  The exception is where the Revenue Commissioners are, themselves, seeking to collect tax outside the four-year period.  In such a case, any repayment that cannot be made but which was paid in respect of the same period as the tax liability Revenue is seeking to collect will be available for offset.  The amount available for offset will be limited to the amount of tax revenue in pursuing for that period.  This exception can be justified on the basis that it poses no threat to current year tax flows to the Exchequer, as old repayments will be set off against corresponding old liabilities.  Where a repayment of tax is claimed within the four-year period the repayment will still be available for offset in the normal way.  In this regard, the amendment clarifies that similar to repayments there is no right of offset outside of that already provided for under the tax codes.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The amendment makes a number of technical amendments to the legislation dealing with the repayment of tax, to clarify a number of matters.  These include: extending the repayment provisions to the new taxes introduced over the past few years; clarifying the definition of tax for repayment purposes; and correcting an apparent error in the repayment provisions of some tax codes, in that the right to a repayment outside the tax legislation does not appear to have been fully eliminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I commend the amendment to the sub-committee.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_813">In page 175, before section 114, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_814">114.—(1) Section 811 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following after subsection (5):</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_815">"(5A) (<i>a</i>) In this subsection—</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_816">‘assessment' includes a first assessment, an additional assessment, an additional first assessment and an estimate or estimation;</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_817">‘amendment', in relation to an assessment, includes the adjustment, alteration or correction of the assessment.</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_818">(<i>b</i>) Where the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction, becomes final and conclusive, then for the purposes of giving effect to this section, any time limit provided for by Part 41, or by any other provision of the Acts, on the making or amendment of an assessment or on the requirement or liability of a person to pay tax or to pay additional tax—</p>
          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_819">(i) shall not apply, and</p>
          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_820">(ii) shall not affect the collection and recovery of any amount of tax or additional tax that becomes due and payable.".</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_821">(2) (<i>a</i>) Subsection (1) applies to any assessment to tax or any amendment of any assessment to tax which is made, on or after 28 February 2012, so that the tax advantage resulting from a tax avoidance transaction, in respect of which a notice of opinion has become final and conclusive, is withdrawn from or denied to any person concerned.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_822">(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a), "assessment", "amendment", "tax advantage", "tax avoidance transaction", "notice of opinion" and "final and conclusive" shall be read in accordance with section 811 of the Principal Act.".</p>
          <p eId="para_823">This amendment inserts a new subsection (5A) to section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which is a general anti-avoidance provision and an important part of the State's armoury in the fight against abuse of tax avoidance schemes.  Under this legislation Revenue is empowered to form the opinion that particular transactions entered into by a taxpayer are, in fact, abusive.  Where the taxpayer disputes this opinion, the matter is settled by the appeal commissioners or the courts.  If Revenue is, ultimately, successful the taxpayer must pay over the tax that he or she had hoped to avoid, along with interest and a surcharge where the taxpayer had not made a protective notification to Revenue in respect of the transaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Separately in our tax legislation, there is a general four-year rule concerning tax assessments, tax payments and tax repayment.  What this means is that, except in specific circumstances, Revenue cannot make a tax assessment on a person for a tax year after four years.  Similarly, a person cannot seek a repayment of tax after the four years.  However, one of the exceptions to this rule is where a transaction falls foul of section 811, in which case there is no time limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">As an indirect result of comments in a High Court judgment made last year, the Revenue Commissioners <i>v</i>. Hans Droog, an element of doubt has arisen over Revenue’s entitlement to make or amend the necessary assessment beyond the four-year period so as to actually collect the tax after a transaction has been judged to be abusive.  Where the courts are involved, the process of determining if the transaction is abusive will almost always take more than four years, so while these assessments are merely a procedural means of finally getting the tax into the Exchequer, they are important nonetheless.  It would be nonsensical if, having secured a determination from the courts, up to and including the Supreme Court, that a transaction is abusive, Revenue was prevented from collecting the tax that falls due for technical procedural reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">This amendment removes any lingering doubt there might be that all of these final steps necessary to collect the tax where a transaction has been shown to be abusive are not bound by the four-year rule.  The measure will come into effect for assessments made or amended after today, arising out of transactions, which have been finally determined to be tax avoidance transactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Tax avoidance is a very serious matter.  As it is usually conducted away from public gaze, it is difficult to accurately assess the drain it poses on the Exchequer.  However, it is measured in hundreds of millions of euro.  Of that I am certain.  In these difficult times the State cannot afford this level of potential loss and if I feel other changes are necessary to assist Revenue in this area, I will not hesitate to introduce them.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_257" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_833">The Deputy's amendment proposes to introduce a new section into the Bill which would require the Minister for Finance, within three months of the passing of the Finance Act, to prepare a report on the contribution made to the Exchequer by the domicile levy and, in particular, the contribution as a result of the measures introduced by the Finance Act 2012,  and to lay that report before Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Before explaining why I cannot accept the amendment, I will address what is a significant misunderstanding in respect of so-called tax exiles.  The taxation of individuals in the State is broadly in line with that prevailing in most other OECD jurisdictions.  In general terms, individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes are taxable here on their worldwide income and gains.  Individuals who are not resident here for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in the State and income derived from working here and from certain assets in the State or from certain assets which derive their value from certain assets in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">It is important to note that not all non-resident individuals who file a tax return here are tax exiles.  Legitimate cases include "ordinary" Irish nationals who have moved abroad for work reasons but have prudently retained their home in this State.  In such cases, the individual's tax return is generally only in respect of rental income on his or her home here.  Likewise, foreign nationals who never resided here but who have investments, including property, in the State, and foreign nationals who worked here for a period and who may have not acquired Irish tax residency for that period during a relevant tax year - individuals who worked here on a temporary assignment, for example - are not tax exiles in the common understanding of the phrase.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">In an Irish context, discussion regarding tax exiles generally focuses on individuals of Irish origin who are perceived to be largely based in Ireland but who arrange their affairs so that they are not tax resident in the State and hence pay less tax than they would if they were Irish tax resident.  The Minister stated in his budget speech that he intends to keep the contentious issue of the tax treatment of tax exiles under constant review.  Contained within the Taxation Measures for Introduction in 2012<i>, </i>which accompanied the Budget Statement, is a commitment to publish, in early 2012, a set of proposed amendments to the current tax regime as it applies to non-residents and to present such proposed amendments for public consultation with a view to informing preparation for further changes in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The Deputy's amendment relates to section 119 of the Bill, which gives effect to the proposal announced in the Budget Statement that citizenship be removed as a requirement for payment of the domicile levy.  This means that, regardless of citizenship, the domicile levy will be payable by Irish-domiciled individuals whose Irish assets exceed €5 million, whose worldwide income exceeds €1 million and whose liability to Irish income tax for the relevant year is less than €200,000.  The amendment applies to domicile levy chargeable for the year 2012 and subsequent years.  It should be noted that payment of the levy for a particular year can be made at any time up to and including 31 October in the year immediately following the year in which the levy was chargeable.  This means that payment of the levy for 2012 can be made up to and including 31 October 2013.  As the impact of the changes made to the domicile levy by the Finance Bill will not be known until after 31 October 2013, I regret that I cannot accept Deputy McGrath's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">I understand the domicile levy yielded €1.5 million last year from a total of ten individuals.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">Revenue acts in accordance with the laws as they exist.  I agree that the amount taken in last year was quite derisory.  The levy must be designed in a way that is proportionate but also fair and seen to be fair.  The Minister has undertaken to review the matter as soon as possible and, if additional changes are to be brought about, to introduce them in the next Finance Bill.  I presume he will also consult with the sub-committee on this issue.  There is a role for the Opposition in agreeing how this levy might be redesigned to ensure it gives a more substantial yield.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">In terms of the immediate changes introduced in the budget in regard to citizenship, we are not in a position to assess how many additional people will be affected.

          <p eId="para_845">I welcome the measure introduced in the Bill in so far as it attempts to chase down some of those multimillionaires or multibillionaires who are apparently choosing to live outside the State in order to avoid paying taxes.  Is there any evidence that such is happening and how do we identify non-compliant persons?  Does Revenue wait for them to identify themselves voluntarily, for example, or does it take it upon itself to inform such persons that they may be liable?  How do we identify the constituency for this tax and how are those who make up that constituency responding?  The amount of money yielded and the number of persons involved are both quite minuscule.  Is there anything we can do about this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_264" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_846">The straight answer is that of course it is something we can do.  That is why the Minister wants to consult widely in respect of this matter in 2012.  Obviously, he is not satisfied with regard to the poor level of return.  The original proposal in this regard was brought forward by the previous Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, in 2008 or 2009.  There was an expectation at that time that the yield would be significantly greater than that which has been realised to date.  There is a responsibility on all our parts to consider how this might be framed in a way which would significantly increase the yield while also ensuring that the effect of the levy would be proportionate.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The Deputy inquired as to whether there is any evidence to indicate whether people are renouncing their citizenship as a means of avoiding the liability which obtains.  The only evidence we have to date is anecdotal in nature.  However, such evidence is not worth the paper on which it is written.  We have no concrete evidence in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I am also informed by Revenue that if its risk assessment systems indicate that where someone who would have been expected to pay the levy has not done so, it will examine the matter very closely.  There are individuals who would be identifiable to us all and who might not be paying the levy.  If they are not doing so, Revenue engages in a thorough investigation of their affairs and reaches a determination in respect of whether a liability exists.  To be honest, the domicile levy has not been successful in bringing forward a significant yield.  Nor has it led to the very high-worth individuals to whom I refer paying the additional amounts they were expected to pay.  That is why the entire scheme is going to be reconsidered by the Minister during the current year.  The input of the Deputy and the remaining members of the committee will be important in that regard.</p>

One would expect such exchanges to occur in any event.  The difficulty arises in cases where people's assets or wealth are located outside the EU.  A convention currently being ratified by the members of the Council of Europe and the OECD will allow for administrative assistance and co-operation and exchange of information on a much wider basis.  The terms of this convention will relate to Council of Europe and OECD countries but it will include a facility whereby states outside these organisations may sign up to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_874">Will the Minister of State indicate what is the purpose of this section, which relates to the capital services redemption account?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_291" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_875">This is a standard provision first introduced in the Finance Act 1950.  The latter established the capital services redemption account, CSRA, also known as the sinking fund.  The CSRA was set up on foot of a decision by the then Government that borrowings for voted capital services should be amortised over a period of 30 years in order that they would involve no permanent addition to the public debt.  Each year a new annuity is calculated and this is designed to provide an annual sum which, when accumulated over 30 years, will amortise the expected borrowings in respect of expenditure and voted capital services for that year.  The Finance Bill gives statutory effect to this annuity.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Section 122 provides for an annuity of just over €118 million to be charged on the Central Fund in 2012 - and for the following 29 years - in order to cover the projected borrowings for voted capital services this year.  It has also been the practice to adjust the annuity in the previous year's Finance Act in order to take account of the actual outturn for the borrowing requirement in respect of voted capital services in that year.  The Finance Act 2011 provided for an annuity of just over €141 million and this is being amended to €118 million in the Bill in order to take account of the actual outturn for last year.  On foot of the provisions in the Finance Act, annual payments are made from the capital fund into the capital services redemption account.  These comprise both principal and interest elements.  A sum not exceeding the interest portion of the annuity may be paid from the account each year towards meeting interest on the national debt.  In practice this has no impact on the budgetary position as this portion of the annuity is applied towards meeting interest payments which would otherwise have to be funded from the Exchequer.  The balance of the annuity is applied towards funding debt redemption.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The practical impact of this arrangement is that the cost of capital projects each year is charged to the current budget over a 30-year period.  This is somewhat akin to the treatment of depreciation in commercial accounting.  The charge results in an increase in the current budget deficit or a reduction in the current budget surplus.  However, given that the costs of the capital projects are included in the capital budget each year as they are incurred it is necessary to credit the capital budget with an amount equal to that charged to the current budget in order to avoid double accounting.  The result of these transactions, therefore, is that the payment to the capital services redemption account on the current side is cancelled by a receipt on the capital side leaving the Exchequer balance unchanged.  In practice, the payment to the account is used to make interest and principal payments in the year in question and, as such, the year end balance is generally minimal.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">Yes.  Is that not to be classified as a national debt?  In the broadest terms the current national debt is approximately €186 billion.  Approximately €139 million of that is effectively the structural deficit.  It is the difference on the current side, and the remaining portion of it, even though they do not classify it as a full national debt, is the capital local authority debt and other debt.  I am presuming that is the rationale for that.  It is voted expenditure.  I suppose it is because it will be paid off at some point.  I do not know.  We can get further clarification on that for the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">Members will be glad to know this is the last amendment.  Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief at the standard rate in respect of rent paid by individuals for private rented accommodation that is their sole or main residence.  Section 14 of the Finance Act 2011 ceased section 473 from 8 December 2010 for new rental agreements beginning on or after that date.  However, tax relief for individuals already paying rent on that date is to be phased out over a number of years up to and including 2017.  The table in the definition of "specified limit" in subsection (1) of section 473 provides the amount of relief due during this phasing out period.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">It has come to my attention that the amount of relief for widowed or married persons over 55 for 2013 in column 3 of the table is incorrect.  This amendment corrects the error and increases the relief available for the 2013 tax year from €3,600 to €4,000 for widowed or married persons aged over 55 by inserting a new sub-paragraph (<i>d</i>) into paragraph (<i>a</i>) of section 6.</p>
