In light of the importance of this matter, I hope that the Ceann Comhairle will allow it.

A further reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank is expected today.  The Minister rightly stated that——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I will give him full marks for his response, but I will ask my question in any event.  The House passed legislation giving the banking system a guarantee on deposits, which we supported.  The Minister for Finance rightly stated we are deep into the banking sector.  How is it proposed to use the legislation to ensure the reduction in interest rates is passed on quickly to the thousands of mortgage holders and small businesses who need it and that it will not be used by the banks to expand their profit base?Some 18 sitting days remain until the proposed Christmas recess.  From a budget that was clearly botched emerged the proposal to withdraw the universal right of persons over 70 years of age to medical cards.  When will the legislation be introduced in the House and will there be adequate time to analyse the Government's response to the effect that only 5% of persons over 70 years of age will lose their medical cards?Regarding the question asked by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the Minister for Health and Children announced the withdrawal of the proposed cervical cancer vaccination scheme for girls of 12 and 13 years of age.  Given that the amount of money involved is so small, the Government is being short-sighted.  Will it consider trying to find €10 million somewhere else——

Last Monday and Tuesday, I attended a meeting of ECOFIN and meetings yesterday and today have been attended by the governor of the Central Bank, Mr. John Hurley.  I welcome the European Central Bank's announcement of a cut in interest rates, which I expect our banks to pass on.  In the case of tracker mortgages, they are obliged to do so.  It would also be essential in terms of their competitiveness to pass on cuts, not only to those purchasing properties on variable mortgages, but to small and medium-sized enterprises in need of credit.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	23	And quickly.

It does not provide for State assistance or participation in the banks.  For this reason, the State does not have a right of commercial interference.  However, I anticipate that the cuts will be passed on to those most in need of them, namely, the banks' customers.Regarding legislation on medical cards, the HSE will shortly write to all persons of 70 years of age and over asking those whose income is more than €700 per week gross for a single person——

First, I would like the Minister for Finance to clarify his response in respect of the legislation for the withdrawal of medical cards from the over-70s.  What he has just said represents a change from that previously announced.  I would like the Minister to clarify the matter.Second, with regard to the Minister's response to Deputy Kenny on the issue of the expected reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank, ECB, I share his hope that the Irish banks and lending institutions will pass on that reduction to their borrowers and mortgage holders.  I am astonished by what the Minister said in this regard.  In effect, what he is saying is that if the banks and building societies do not pass on the reduction in interest rates, there is nothing he can do about it.

In relation to the medical cards, legislation to give effect to the changes in this regard will be enacted before the end of 2008 and will come into effect on 1 January 2009.  Heads of a Bill, to give effect to the budget arrangements, have been drafted and will come before Government soon.  I anticipate the legislation will be published this month.As regards the passing on of interest rate reductions by the European Central Bank, I have already explained that I anticipate these interest rate changes will be passed on.  I wish to put on the record and to explain that under the guarantee scheme the Government has entered into an arrangement with each of the institutions whereby substantial influence can be exerted on these institutions through the appointment of directors and participation by the regulator in the credit and risk assessment procedures of these banks.  It is in the banks' own commercial interests to pass on these interest rate reductions.

I allow leeway to the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the House.  In allowing this leeway, I must also be given a certain amount of latitude.  It must be understood that I have no choice but to implement Standing Orders where a clear breach occurs, as is the case in this instance.

It has now been replaced by the nursing home support Bill which is extremely different from that originally promised.

There is potential in geothermal energy and for some time those in the sector have sought legislation.  In today's newspapers, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is quoted as saying he will do everything required to ensure this source of energy can be developed and exploited.  I take that to mean he will deliver on legislation.  Will the Minister for Finance indicate if the legislation is being prepared and when it is likely to come before us?

Some time ago the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance indicated that arising from the general banking and financial crisis, there was a need to get back to traditional banking practices.  In addition to promised legislation, is it intended to introduce further legislation?  Legislation is proposed to consolidate and modernise financial services legislation in accordance with the Government's better regulation agenda.  I did not know the Government had a better regulation agenda.

When will the legislation be brought before the House and is it deemed necessary to bring it in as a matter of urgency in the current unstable climate that exists in the financial sector?  Will the Minister give some indication to the House as to the importance he is likely to accord to that legislation, given the manner in which it is likely to affect his Department and his Department will affect it?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	147	We do not rate legislation at this time, we look for answers on when it will come.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Three legislative measures relate to Deputy Durkan's question.  The financial services regulation Bill, as Deputy Durkan mentioned, consolidates and modernises financial services legislation in accordance with the Government's better regulation agenda and an advisory forum has been established to assist and advise my Department on completing this project.  Initial work indicates the consolidation aspect of the project involves 50 Acts, 250 statutory instruments and 70 commencement orders.  The advisory forum will report on the draft heads to the Minister early next year so it is not possible at this stage to give a publication date.There is a financial services deposit guarantee scheme Bill, which contains 11 heads, and this gives effect to the Government decision to enhance the protection arrangements applying to deposits with banks, building societies and credit unions from 20 September 2008.  That is a new Bill which is expected to be published as soon as possible.  To some extent, for the next two years, the Bill has been superseded by the terms of the guarantee given by the Government.  It remains important legislation for the credit unions and institutions not within the scope of the guarantee.There is also the financial services miscellaneous provisions Bill, which contains 21 heads, and this transfers ministerial responsibility for building societies from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Minister for Finance and provides for various miscellaneous amendments.  The scope of required legal changes is being examined and the Bill is expected to be published in 2009.On the general banking position, I am content with the powers given by the Houses of the Oireachtas in dealing with ongoing developments.

It is before us today.  Is it right and proper that should happen when we will have unemployment of over 325,000 next year and when one person loses their job in this country every three minutes?

This issue is very difficult for tens of thousands of people who are in properties subject to property management companies.  They cannot even address matters where there are serious defects in a property, as there are in many such properties.  These people have no legal remedy to take control of the management company and get work done.  They are also being charged exorbitant fees.

First, the heads of the Irish Sports Council (amendment) Bill, were approved by the Government on 4 July 2006.  A decision has yet to be made on whether to proceed with the establishment of the subsidiary companies and the expected publication date is in the middle of 2009.As for the planning question, existing legislation enacted by a previous Government in 2001——

However, further measures to strengthen the law in this regard are contained in the planning and development (amendment) Bill, for which the heads are expected at the end of this year.  Its expected publication date is next year.

It is the rest of them about which I am worried.When will Members have sight of the mental capacity Bill?  From his experience as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Finance will be aware this legislation is desperately needed.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	236	The heads of the mental capacity Bill were approved by the Government on 3 September this year.

When does Ireland propose to ratify the Aarhus Convention?  Second, in a Government White Paper some years ago, a commitment was given to ratify the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  Is the Minister in a position to indicate when Ireland proposes to ratify either of these two conventions?  He also might indicate the number of ratifications that await the attention of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enable Ireland to honour obligations for which it has signed.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Regulations transposing the European Communities access to information on the environment directive were signed and came into effect on 1 May 2007.  The process to transpose the other directive is well advanced, with legislation completed to amend the majority of the relevant consent systems pertaining to that directive within an Irish legislative framework.  Work is continuing on the outstanding issues, namely, four consent systems, of which three currently are the responsibility of the Department and one of the Office of Public Works.  It will be finalised at the earliest possible date.  On completion of the full transposition of Directive 2003/35/EC, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Foreign Affairs will ensure the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention will be submitted to the Government and laid before the Dáil.As for the other matter raised by Deputy Higgins, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, I regret I must ask the relevant Minister to communicate with the Deputy about that.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I would appreciate that, as I have a large file on that convention.  People write to me every six months or so.  It is in the Government White Paper on aid and in the Government programme for legislation twice.

Mar a bhí á rá agam an lá cheana, is Bille an-tábhachtach é an Bille Craolacháin 2008.In reflecting on the broadcasting legislation before us, it is important to look back at the history of broadcasting in Ireland, its contribution to our community and whether we are being served by the State broadcasting corporation, RTE.  As far as I am concerned RTE is a left wing organisation that has not committed itself to enunciating and promoting policies laid down by Government or Parliament.  Following the recent budget, in the post-budget discussions RTE had all left wing commentators on programmes without any balance.  Audiences were loaded against Government representatives.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Where is this fellow coming from?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	273	A Government representative is brought onto a panel on either radio or television where all the other panel members hold opposite views.  That situation is distorting the balance.  It is time for us as a Parliament to ensure that whatever we do we fulfil the constitutional duty of equality, fairness and balance in the interests of our citizens.  That is very important.I remember going onto an RTE radio programme one morning with a celebrated broadcaster who was highly paid.  He enunciated to the nation how the world should proceed as he saw it.  He had 17 staff assisting him.  The questions he asked on-air were automatically generated on a computer screen and he had only to read out the questions.  That gave the impression to the world that he had researched all those questions himself and that he was a highly intelligent man.  Perhaps he was a much more intelligent man than I.  Members must be accountable for their staff and the amount of money that is spent, including Ministers.  It is time we examined that situation.I am aware of serious invasions of privacy when families in my constituency were bedevilled by trauma.  In sad situations involving misadventure, houses were surrounded by the media.  The State broadcaster sent couriers to push messages through letter-boxes stating that if a special interview was given by the family at an arranged location to it alone then all of the other media could be looked after, that one interview would solve the situation, and that the family should do that in its own interest.  On the two occasions with which I am familiar the two families did not give interviews, they withstood the pressure, sustained themselves and stood together.  One family was confined to its own house for a week.Another woman was confined also in her home as a result of utterances in a debate in this House, which RTE covered in almost its entirety because it involved more drama than fact.  That woman, whose house was surrounded by the media, died a few weeks later as a result of the pressures that were put on her following the unfortunate allegations made against her beloved son.  In both cases there was no wrongdoing, there was just sadness and trauma in a family situation and they were exploited and exposed to unnecessary public mire.I abhor radio programmes, be they in the independent radio system or on RTE, where people can telephone anonymously and make allegations and statements but nobody knows who they are.  If a broadcaster licensed by Parliament and the State authorities broadcast such pronouncements the people who make them should be named on those programmes.  If people are not prepared to put their names to the comments they should not be read out.I abhor also another situation in which I feel RTE has failed the State.  I worked for a period as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Our remit was to ensure the creation from foreign direct investment of as many jobs as possible and to assist IDA Ireland, which has done an outstanding job in attracting foreign direct investment in this country.  On one occasion the senior Minister in my Department travelled to a provincial town to announce 400 jobs.  RTE was there and showed the Minister at the opening but it did not cover his speech.  It interviewed the president of the local chamber of commerce who complimented the Government and the IDA on the investment in the town but that interview was not shown.  The RTE team drove 40 miles to another town and spoke to the president of the chamber of commerce of that town who made a negative comment about the 400 jobs that were awarded to the other town.  The implication was that it was wrong to give the 400 jobs to the first town when they should have gone to the other town.That was not balanced or fair.  It was not an equitable coverage of a situation.  The town that got the investment was fully entitled to it as the enterprise suited that location, yet the coverage of the massive investment by the State on behalf of taxpayers with the support of the IDA in partnership with a foreign company was distorted by RTE.  What view would the company have taken when it played the clip back in its boardroom and saw the type of coverage the State broadcaster gave to its investment and commitment to our country?  How could the board be satisfied it was getting proper, fair and equitable treatment?  It is critical that we examine such situations carefully.The State has supported RTE over the years and the public pays a hefty licence fee.  It is time we revisited that situation.  TG4, which is doing an outstanding job, should be an independent entity.  It is time for one third of the licence fee to go to TG4, another third should remain with RTE and one third should go to TV3 and the independent radio sector.  That would ensure there is an equitable playing field and that there is fairness across the board in all aspects of broadcasting.Successive Governments have enacted legislation which has resulted in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, acting in conjunction with the broadcasting authority, issuing licences for local radio.  This Bill should be amended to ensure that if the companies that are licensed are sold then a percentage of the profits made on the sale should accrue to the State.

I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak.A famous Irishman who was chairman first of CIE and subsequently chairman of RTE was asked a question on his retirement about the difference between the two organisations.  He said, "Regretfully, I think the latter carries more passengers".  That was a serious indictment from a man who helped to build up many semi-State corporations.  It is time that we as legislators ensured there is fairness, equity and proper scrutiny, and that Members of Parliament, no matter what party they belong to or none, and, similarly, members of Government, are treated with dignity and respect in order that such situations as we witnessed recently do not re-occur, when the Taoiseach and two former Ministers were ridiculed by way of satiric comedy on a national broadcaster.  I do not have a problem with satire and comedy in their rightful place but if a show is broadcast nationally to families, including young children, in a world of global communications, the Members of this Parliament and all people holding public office deserve due regard and respect.  Loading audiences and having unbalanced programmes is no way to serve politics, the Parliament, the public or the nation.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Maybe they are some of the leftover socialists from the time of former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who described himself as a socialist.  The idea that the RTE board is a left-wing organisation is crazy.  I am not on RTE very often but any time I am in its studios, I am treated with respect and as any human being should be treated.  I have no complaint in that regard whatever.The reason I am intervening in this debate is an announcement made yesterday by Cathal Goan of RTE regarding the decision to broadcast RTE programmes to the diaspora, particularly in Britain.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, announced yesterday that he is postponing that project, indefinitely I would say.The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, supports the project and I will recap for him the history of the decision.  The Labour Party tabled a Private Members' motion in the House concerning the implementation of a task force for the Irish abroad.  One aspect was the broadcasting of RTE material so that it would reach the Irish who live in Britain.  Very many Irish live there who were forced out of this country for economic reasons in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  Most are now very old but they long to have contact with home and to be informed about what is happening here.  RTE was to be the vehicle to meet this demand.  For some time, the commercial channel Tara rebroadcast some of the RTE programmes but it was discontinued for commercial reasons.I raised this matter in the House with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and got a very receptive response.  He told me a broadcasting Bill was due and that my proposal would be contained in it.  This is the Bill we are debating today.  Given that I knew the gestation period of such legislation, I asked the former Taoiseach whether he would agree to producing a short Bill simply to deal with this issue.  The Minster responsible at the time was the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and he was not as responsive to my pleading as Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I kept pressing the matter and the former Taoiseach convinced the Minister in one way or another — I am not sure what method he used — to introduce a short Bill.  He did so and the Bill had two purposes, the first of which was to deal with broadband and the second of which was to authorise RTE to broadcast outside the island of Ireland.  RTE was very unfavourably disposed to the idea of broadcasting outside the island and it dug up the old Broadcasting Act and found an excuse therein for not doing so.However, the Government and Parliament changed the law, on foot of the task force report, to enable RTE to broadcast to Britain.  This was a positive development.  RTE is obliged to implement Government policy in this regard.  If it wants to find areas in which to make cutbacks, I will find some, as would Deputy Noel Treacy.  I would save €2 million for it without any difficulty and I am sure Deputy Treacy would save €10 million quite easily in its very large budget.At the time the legislation was considered, RTE representatives told me the proposal would cost money and would not be commercially viable.  It stated it did not want to implement it.  The Government, with the support of Parliament, changed the law and told it to do so.  Broadcasting was to commence on St. Patrick's Day this year.  Mr. Goan stated to the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources yesterday morning that RTE would save money by not implementing Government policy in this regard.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, use every bit of authority he has to address this matter?  He has the full support of all sides of this House, which supported the campaign to implement the proposal that RTE should broadcast to the Irish in Britain at an early date.  I ask the Minister of State to use all his authority, with the backing of all parties in this House, to make RTE reverse its decision and make €2 million in savings elsewhere.  It should implement the decision that the Government changed the law to allow for in the first instance.  The Minister of State is positively disposed towards this, as is the Government.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I thank the Deputies who have spoken during this debate for their valuable contributions and constructive approach.The general thrust of this Bill is to ensure a regulatory environment that will sustain and develop the broadcasting sector in Ireland, and the component parts of that sector, including public service broadcasting, commercial broadcasting, community broadcasting and the independent production sector.  The Bill aims to strike a balance between the needs and interests of the various sectoral players, but at its core is a belief that the interests of viewers and listeners are paramount.  This is reflected in a number of initiatives, including amendments to the framework for the children's advertising code, as referred to by a number of Members; the requirement for RTE and TG4 to maintain a focus on children's programming; the requirement for RTE and TG4 to maintain audience councils; the enhanced right of reply; and empowering the BAI to conduct audience surveys at the start of the broadcasting contract award process.I will respond to some of the issues raised by the Deputies during the course of this debate and I acknowledge their very constructive approach.  Most of them were very supportive of what we propose and had some suggestions and ideas for improving the Bill in some areas.  This was also the case in the Seanad, whose Members were also very supportive of what we are proposing.  They dealt with the Bill in a very constructive manner.A debate on broadcasting standards took place in the Seanad earlier in the week.  It arose as a result of audiences feeling they were insulted by comedians on television in recent times.  It is obviously difficult to try to strike a balance without interfering too much but it is important that we have certain codes that would be adhered to.  There will always be an expectation of standards, particularly when watching the programmes of the national broadcaster.  People do not want to be insulted or offended when watching programmes in their own kitchens or sitting rooms.Deputy Durkan stressed the importance of the development of an Oireachtas channel as a means of making the workings of our democracy transparent and as widely available as possible.  I noted the support of Deputies White, Kenneally, Naughten and Creighton for this position and I wholeheartedly agree with them.  The recent debate in these Houses on the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill would have drawn a significant viewership, as would Private Members' debates over recent weeks.  Making the work of these Houses accessible, even in the case of a small audience with a specialist interest, is a proper public service.  None of us expects that thousands of people will be tuning in every day to hear what we are saying in the Houses.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The types of material to which Deputy Durkan refers and material on the Internet fall to be addressed by existing criminal law rather than within the context of the Broadcasting Bill.  The aim of the Bill is to ensure that broadcasting standards are maintained.  Viewers and listeners have a general expectation of high standards from Irish broadcasters and we must ensure that this trust is not breached.Regarding Deputy Durkan's comments on the right of reply, I agree with him that this is not a panacea for all ills.  However, a right of reply will assist in mitigating the damage done to a person's reputation by means of a broadcast of inaccurate facts.  I concur with Deputy Clune's and Deputy McGrath'spoints that if this recourse is to work speed is of the essence.  Those who feel they have been unjustly treated on television or radio always wish to have the matter dealt with as quickly as possible.In respect of Deputy McManus's and Deputy Coveney's observations on whether the BCI and ComReg might be merged into a single entity, this issue was considered in the formulation of the legislation.  The principal argument against is the requirement for separate knowledge sets.  In essence, ComReg is a network or platform distribution regulator and the BCI and BCC are content regulators.Deputies McManus and O'Higgins are correct in saying that the Bill contains no general definition of what is meant by public service broadcasting.  However, there are very specific definitions of the public service broadcasting mandates of individual public service broadcasters, namely, section 114 for RTE, section 118 for TG4, section 125 for the Oireachtas Channel and section 127 for the Irish Film Channel.  The mandates of RTE and TG4 continue to encompass the public service formula of Lord Reith, the first chairman of the BBC, whose definition of what public service broadcasting should be was: "to inform, to educate and to entertain".  The approach taken in the Bill mirrors that of jurisdictions with strong traditions of public service broadcasting.Deputies McManus, Coveney, Kenneally and O'Flynn also raised the concerns of broadcasters in respect of any levy introduced in order to fund the activities of the BAI.  Section 37 of the Bill requires the BAI to publish estimates of expenditure in advance to allow broadcasters to assess the likely extent of the levy.  Expansion of this provision is being considered in order to address some of the concerns expressed.Deputy McManus made a point regarding archiving.  The Bill leaves it to the BAI to decide upon the appropriate balance of funding from the broadcasting fund as between programme making and archiving.  Archiving is necessary if we are to maintain for future generations a sense of who we are and of the road we have travelled.  However, the process of developing archives, and, more important, the process of developing a culture of archiving among all broadcasters, is a long-term one.  We would all agree that the preservation of archival material is a progressive development and it is one we would all support.  The older we get the more important archival material becomes.As is evidenced by subsections (6) to (12) of section 69 the emphasis in this Bill is on the initial tentative step in that process, that of preservation.  Concerning analogue switchover, Deputies will be aware that the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 set the framework for the roll-out of digital terrestrial television by RTE and, subject to contract finalisation by the BCI, by Boxer DTT.  The roll-out of digital terrestrial television services in 2009 will afford the opportunity to begin the process of informing viewers of the process of analogue switch-off.  Section 11(8) of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, which is restated in section 139(6) of the Bill, provides that RTE must take steps to ensure that viewers are made aware of analogue switch-off, the reason for it, the consequences of it, and practical information on how viewers can receive services by digital means after switch-off.

Section 3 of the Act of 2007, as mentioned by the Minister of State, is the section that empowers RTE or gives it authority to broadcast to Britain.  I ask the Minister of State that, in his response, he might say something about this.  If he does not, RTE will say that the Minister ignored Deputy Stagg in the Dáil.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I have taken note of Deputy Stagg's comment and I shall refer to it later.I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Mary Wallace, and Deputies Clune, Andrews, Kenneally and White for their comments and support in respect of the strengthened provisions on children's advertising.  These provisions will serve to protect the general public health interests concerning children.  We are all aware that significant budgets are provided for programming aimed at young people and also that many young people believe that everything contained in such programming is true.  We must be very careful about what we allow and about the type of advertising aimed directly at children that we permit on television.  The finalisation of the national nutrition policy as outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, is something I welcome.I concur with the views of Deputies Nolan and Coveney in respect of the need for a focus on the development of children's programming.  Section 101 specifically requires RTE and TG4 to outline on a regular basis their proposals for children's programming.  Section 96 of the Bill empowers the audience councils of RTE and TG4 to conduct research into the programming needs of children and young persons.I welcome Deputy Calleary's support for the added transparency measures outlined in the Bill in respect of contract award processes.  These legislative changes are intended to reflect the outcome of the 2004 radio licensing review.  I agree also with his point about the critical role played by local radio in reporting local news and current affairs.  As public representatives, we can all appreciate the importance that locals play——

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	294	In respect of the 20% news and current affairs quota, it should be recognised that all broadcasters benefit from the allocation to them of very valuable radio spectrum.  The quid pro quo for such an allocation is that certain public service obligations attach, particularly with regard to the news and current affairs quota which will also apply to RTE under this Bill.  The rationale for this quota is, and continues to be, the importance to our democracy of ensuring independent news sources and debating fora.With regard to Deputy Coveney's observations on the television licence, at some stage in the future we may have to move away from the television licence as a basis for the funding of public service broadcasting, given the pace of technological developments.  This is an issue with which many European countries are attempting to grapple.  However, the licence fee has served us well over the last half century, despite its limitations.  It ensured some measure of independence for RTE from both political and commercial pressures.  It has also acted as a direct link between audiences and RTE, reminding the national public service broadcaster to whom its public service duty is ultimately owed.  As such we must review proposed alternatives with caution and due diligence.Deputies Naughton, Creighton, Andrews, Coveney, McGrath, Clune and O'Flynn raised concerns regarding religious advertising. As the Deputies will be aware, the prohibition on religious advertising was subject to a lengthy public consultation in 2004 during which over 150 submissions from the public were received by my Department.  The conclusion from that consultation process was that the existing prohibition should be retained.Section 41 of the Broadcasting Bill continues the prohibition on religious advertising but does so in a less restrictive manner.  The provision focuses on advertisements that address the issue of the merits, or otherwise, of adhering to any religious faith or belief, or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation.  The existing broader restriction relates to advertisements directed towards a religious end.  The section also maintains the clarification that permits advertisements which provide information about a religious magazine or periodical being available for sale, or about a religious event or ceremony taking place.  This is a difficult and sensitive issue, and is one that merits further discussion by Deputies on Committee Stage.I wish to acknowledge the important role played by Deputy O'Flynn in chairing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which oversaw the innovative eConsultation process that informed the formulation of this Bill.  The committee's role was important and committee members worked together in a genuine and helpful way.Deputy Treacy was very critical of RTE in his contribution this morning, as he was some weeks ago.  Yesterday RTE made a presentation before the joint committee and outlined the serious financial situation in which it finds itself.  There is no doubt the organisation must make difficult decisions in the months ahead.Deputy Stagg expressed dissatisfaction regarding RTE's decision to postpone the RTE international television service and the Freesat system to Britain.  The organisation has an obligation to provide RTE international under the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007.  RTE wrote to the Department to indicate that RTE international would not launch as planned by March this year owing to cutbacks but that the matter would be reconsidered later in the year.  The Department has written to RTE underlining the organisation's statutory obligation and seeking clarity on when the service will be launched.  The broadcasting needs of Irish people overseas are also being discussed with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We are conscious of the commitment we gave in this regard and we will continue with our efforts with RTE to have the matter resolved.

This list is indicative that something is wrong in society.  From time to time, questions have been raised about whether various matters are proceeding in accordance with good practice and due diligence.  While I do not argue that the current regime is complicit in this matter, during my time as a Member of the Oireachtas various issues have been raised which could and should have been addressed in the House by way of Question Time, parliamentary inquiry, for which provision is made, or one of a number of other methodologies available to Members.  We did not have the wherewithal or commitment to take this course of action and opted instead for a cumbersome and expensive procedure of inquiry.In general, those who have been critical of the inquiry system have not criticised the inquiries  per se but have focused on their cost and the endless nature of the process.  Members of the public also ask the reasons inquiries take so long and cannot be brought to a conclusion much earlier.  I fully realise that the tribunals of inquiry must have due regard for the rights of the persons who come before them, the various procedures laid down and their terms of reference.The inquiries established thus far, including the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments and the Morris tribunal, have shed light on indiscretions which have taken place at various levels.  I was astonished during the recent debate on the report of the Morris tribunal that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform chose to lambaste a serving Deputy and former Deputy.  His intervention in this matter was unprecedented in my experience in the House and I have been a Deputy for longer than he has.  The manner of the Minister's departure from procedure and practice was scandalous.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I have done so.  This is a simple matter.  The Minister should have addressed himself to the reasons the Morris tribunal was established.  Why was the Government reluctant to allow an inquiry to be held?  Deputies should remember the extensive debate we had in the House on the necessity of establishing an inquiry into the events subsequently inquired into by the Morris tribunal.  The issues which caused the House to establish the tribunal were obvious and members of the public had been concerned about them for a long time.What did the Minister do in his contribution to the recent debate?  He did not apologise to the victims or beg the forgiveness of the House for the long delay but instead attacked a Member of the Oireachtas and a former Deputy on the basis that the issue was raised in the tribunal's report.  I am surprised that Deputy Byrne, who is a legal practitioner, cited this as a reason for the Minister's intervention.  Members of the Judiciary know well that they have no function in ordering how the House should conduct its business because they are specifically and explicitly precluded from in any way interfering with the process of the House.  While the Oireachtas is precluded by the Constitution from interfering in the judicial process, over the years, it has become the practice for Members to deviate from this stipulation from time to time by commenting on the courts, often in a less than positive manner.  The fact that the Executive has the power to hire and the Oireachtas the power to fire should not be lost on those who wish to make comment.In recent times, the courts and some members of the Judiciary have seen fit to curtail the activities of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the manner in which we attend to our business.  They have no authority in this area and any intrusion should be stoutly resisted in the Houses.  The only persons who have control over procedure and privilege in the Houses are the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  Any intrusion must be resisted, resented and contested because it is an interference in the rights of Members of Parliament to raise issues as they see fit, a right which has nothing to do with the courts.While Members have from time to time commented on the Judiciary, as elected public representatives we have a duty to raise public issues without deference to anyone inside or outside the House.  If we respond to the queries raised by members of the public, that is our function.  I emphasise that under the separation of powers laid down in the Constitution, the courts have no function in telling Members of the Oireachtas what we should do.  We are coming to a stage where we may have to have a referendum.  I know the Government does not like referendums, based on recent experiences.  We may well need to have a referendum to decide who deals with what, and when.  The interpretation of the Constitution is entirely a matter for the courts.  Far be it from me to attempt to lecture my learned colleagues on the opposite side of the House, but I reserve the right, nonetheless — and I have read a small bit of it as well.

The information was fed by Government or by the Minister, by some means or other, to a rookie Member of the House, who was not here when the tribunal of inquiry was set up and knew nothing about it — and tended to judge the manner and methodology used by Members of the House in the pursuit of their business.  I am amazed nothing has happened as a result of that.  It was an appalling attack by a Minister, for whatever purpose he saw fit to do it, whereby he pointed a finger at two Members of the Oireachtas who were pursuing their business as public representatives, as they were well entitled to do at any time.  I thought the Minister would have told the House he was very very sorry for the circumstances in which this particular tribunal of inquiry had to be set up.

However, I would not go too far if I were he.  Suffice to say that serious problems arose in policing in Donegal to which that tribunal refers.  Any attempt by a Member of the House to try to justify and cover this up by making an attack on the Members of the Opposition is appalling and the Minister should either apologise publicly to the people he offended or consider his position.

The Minister's attitude was outrageous.  He completely failed and I do not know why he raised that issue.  He could not have raised the issue on behalf of the gardaí throughout the country who are doing their duty.  They certainly did not ask him to raise the issue.  Perhaps some innocent people were accused, but then many other innocent people were accused of doing things they had no hand, act or part in at the same tribunal of inquiry.  It behoved the chairman of that particular tribunal to deal with the injustices that had been done to all those and keep his reservations about certain Members of the Oireachtas to himself.

I am quite sure that is the case.We have a multiplicity of tribunals of inquiry that have cost multifarious millions of euro.  While they had to be set up in the first place by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and they have done a good job, however ponderously, if it had been possible to ventilate these issues in the Parliament, there would have been no necessity for them in the first place.I am not going to criticise members of the legal profession for becoming involved in something for which they were extraordinarily well paid.  There will be another Bill before the House to deal with that matter in the not too distant future.  However, I want to express the opinion brought to my attention by the general public, to the effect that in some cases it would appear the procedures are long drawn out, self-serving, ponderous and as a result extraordinarily expensive.  In those circumstances a reluctance develops towards setting up tribunals and that is where this legislation has come from — because Ministers have expressed concern as regards why tribunals of inquiry should happen.  The reason is that something is wrong that the public is concerned about which has to be addressed.  As a result, this is what we have.Incidentally, there was a parliamentary inquiry, which was overturned by the courts, to which I have not referred.

I can go into court and in the course of giving evidence make all types of allegations, for which I will not be held responsible or made accountable.  I am afraid extraordinary regulations, curtailments and restrictions are placed on Members of Parliament when they set out to go about doing something for which there is provision under the law as well.  A very experienced deviation took place whereby a tribunal in course in the Oireachtas was set aside by the courts.  The jury should still be out on that decision.  It was a dangerous thing to do.  The whole question of any interference in the process and procedures of the Oireachtas is not a matter for the courts.  The courts have no function in the matter and the sooner they recognise that, the better.  It may suit Government for the reverse to be the case and it may suit it to go to the courts and argue these cases, but it is not in the interest of democracy.

I was involved in the DIRT inquiry and at that time there was significant debate as to whether the Houses of the Oireachtas had the right or ability to carry out an inquiry.  They had, and they did it.  There were legal questions raised at the time, but some of us were of the view that we had the legal authority to conduct an inquiry within the Houses of the Oireachtas.It would save taxpayers significant amounts of money if parliamentary inquiries, for which there is already provision, could be undertaken within the House.  It is not true to say that they would be biased, because both Government and Opposition would be equally represented on such inquiries.  That would be a requirement.  In such cases, no accusations of political bias, good, bad or indifferent, could be made because of the make-up of the inquiry.  Taxpayers could be saved significant expense if many of the issues that have arisen and been dealt with by tribunals of inquiry were referred instead to the Houses of the Oireachtas to be examined under the terms of previous sworn inquiries and using the compellability of witnesses legislation — which is already approved by the Houses — to ensure that people who do not wish to come before an inquiry are compelled to do so.  This is something we should consider.The cost of the DIRT inquiry was in the region of €900,000 and the net benefit to the Exchequer was approximately €1.4 billion.  The inquiry took approximately three to four months to complete its work.  Most of the inquiries we are talking about now have taken years.  Members have come and gone in the House in the length of time these inquiries have taken.

The terms of reference and how the inquiry will take place must be set out clearly.  The length of time for an inquiry and the expected cost must also be borne in mind.  There is a need for a report to be provided within a reasonable time; I am aware this is provided for in the legislation.  We must also recognise the need for a separation between the functions of the courts and of Parliament.  We should also place greater reliance on parliamentary inquiry, which is already available within the ambit of the Oireachtas and which would cost far less than the big boys we have had previously.Some people have raised a question as to what a bunch of red or brown necks elected to the Oireachtas would know about inquiries and how they could be expected to conduct them.  There is only one way for people to find out.

There was criticism of my colleague for coming into the House and welcoming and quoting from a report of a tribunal.

The first matter I had to deal with in the office was to photocopy discovery for the Flood tribunal for a number of clients — clients who were cleared and who made a positive contribution to the tribunal.  That was my first experience of tribunals and I felt they were a waste of money in terms of the thousands of documents that had to be photocopied in discovery not just by us, but also by the tribunals, to be handed out to everybody.  We saw in the latter stages of the tribunal documents relating to certain witnesses appearing in some newspapers at the weekend, in advance of them coming before the tribunal, which was damaging to the system.I am glad this Bill is before the House.  It is late in that many of the tribunals are coming to an end or have closed.  However, every time the Government tried to introduce the Bill previously, it was accused of trying to shut down or stop the tribunals.  There was major debate in the House on that and on the effect we would have on the tribunals by introducing the legislation, completely ignoring the fact that the legislation derives from the Law Reform Commission and the need for reform.  I am unsure whether the current legislation was the last Act of the British Parliament here or the first Act of the Dáil after Independence.  Regardless, it is that old and is no longer suitable.We must change the process and ensure inquiries are more cost effective.  I agree with Deputy Durkan on the issue of costs and tribunals.  Some unqualified legal personnel were paid at half the rate of junior counsel in some of the tribunals, a massive fee to pay someone with no particular qualifications.  That is outrageous.  Barristers working on the tribunals made an absolute fortune just examining discovery.  They are known in the trade as "discovery donkeys".

It is time that stopped.  This legislation will go part of the way to stop it.  The legal profession, barristers in particular, have a sin to answer for with regard to the expenses charged.  It is very well to criticise it now, but while the tribunal was ongoing the Opposition had a full-time spokesman who digested tribunal transcripts each day and was ready to comment on them in detail each night on radio.  The Opposition took great advantage and was delighted with the unspecified allegations being thrown around in the tribunal, allegations that had not been decided on.

Members on this side of the House have consistently said that we will accept the findings of the Mahon tribunal and we look forward to the publication of its report.  All sides of the House will welcome that an end has come to the ridiculous costs associated with the tribunal, although the bills will probably have to paid over the next two years.  These costs will have a significant impact on the public funds.  Some of the barristers employed at the tribunal have worked diligently.

Clearly a superior system is in place in the United States.  The huge level of corruption that took place within these companies was dealt with and forgotten about long ago and the individuals and firms concerned have moved on.  Irish-based employees of the companies were not implicated in these wrongdoings.  Unlike the dotcom inquiry, we are still awaiting a report on issues that have taken place many years ago.Tribunals have not thus far been able to determine civil or criminal liability.  They make findings of fact and if the DPP and the Garda want to pursue the matter further, they have to start their investigations from scratch.  This is not adequate.Tribunals of inquiry owe their immediate origins to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 but the Law Reform Commission traces the concept to a committee of the House of Commons which sat in 1667, or 23 years before the chaos caused to County Meath by the Battle of the Boyne.

We spent much of our time studying High Court and Supreme Court cases which were brought as a result of issues arising in tribunals, such as Cabinet confidentiality.  Not only do these tribunals have an impact on the witnesses they call, but they also influence the wider society.  They have a particular effect on law students who have to study their judgments.  As a young solicitor, I spent many days observing the Flood tribunal on behalf of clients but those days are over.  I have now given up my career, and hopefully not temporarily or until the next election.The functions of tribunals of inquiry include investigating events and learning from what happened.  The Law Reform Commission suggests they also provide a catharsis or therapeutic exposure.  That may be the case in respect of tragedies but I am not sure that the Mahon tribunal will be described as cathartic when it eventually reports.Tribunals are established to provide reassurance.  I hope the report of the Mahon tribunal will reassure people that we are trying to play our roles honestly and without fear or favour.  The politicians who came before the tribunal also worked hard for their constituents and people should have confidence that their elected representatives will do the right thing without being beholden to special interests.  Tribunals can also establish accountability, blame and retribution.The Law Reform Commission suggests that political considerations form part of the functions of a tribunal and that Governments establish them for political reasons, although I am not sure I agree.  The commission argues that by establishing a tribunal, Governments can be seen to be doing something.

Those who were unfortunate enough to appear as witnesses, which thank God I never had to do, played their parts properly, as I am sure the tribunal will find.Tribunals were established under the 1921 Act to investigate matters of urgent public importance.  There is no doubt that the issues referred to the Mahon tribunal were important but people began to wonder about it when its inquiries veered away from its terms of reference.  However, we cannot criticise the tribunal for doing its job.The failure until now to deal with the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 is largely due to Opposition attacks.  When we first introduced the Bill, newspaper headlines accused us of attempting to shut down the tribunals.  This was a misleading accusation which is no longer being made.  The legislation is now welcomed as an attempt to reform the procedures of tribunals.  The Bill provides a modern framework which will govern all aspects of a tribunal from its establishment by the Oireachtas to the publication of its report.  It will require the chairman of a tribunal to conduct the inquiry in a cost-effective and efficient manner.Researchers for tribunals do not need to be paid hundreds of euro per day to read documents.  The tribunals should employ college interns who would do this work for free.  The United States Supreme Court employs interns who are certainly not paid several hundred dollars per day.  The researchers are in effect photocopying documents or checking them for legal privilege.  Given that only a tiny percentage of these documents will in fact be legally privileged, it is outrageous that people are paid several hundred euro per day to check them. When I worked, I did this.  I was a discovery donkey when I was a solicitor's apprentice.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I was not paid well for it but the firm had to charge the client a certain amount of money, which may revert to the Exchequer if the tribunal decides to award costs.  I do not know in that case because I had left the firm by then.  If a good senior counsel charges a lot, that is one thing but anyone would do basic meagre work that anyone with a few brain cells could do.  There would be thousands of applications for that job if it was advertised because it is money for jam.  If researchers are needed, there should be a public advertisement for people who have some qualification that allows them to study documents for legal privilege.  One does not need a first class degree in law or significant legal qualifications to do that job.  This has disturbed me in terms of how these things have operated over the years.What sort of person do we need to read and photocopy documents for legal privilege?  It is not necessarily a lawyer.  Junior and senior counsel can advise if there are any problems and I assume they play a role in any case.  They could work with clerks or administrative staff, who could be paid a good wage.  I am not suggesting people should work for nothing unless they are college students who seek experience.  I suggested this to the Law Reform Commission when it came before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  I suggested starting a system of internship where the commission would look for the best and the brightest from our law schools to use the resources they have for free doing summer work.  Although it has some informal arrangement, I was surprised the Law Reform Commission did not have such a system set up.  The tribunals could do this too, especially for the voluminous discovery work.The main features of the Bill provide for the process of establishing, suspending and dissolving a tribunal, which sometimes must be done.  It is not always the case that we are trying to shut down a tribunal.  Sometimes one does not want it to continue because of the concern at the direction it is taking.  Many of us were concerned at the direction of the Mahon tribunal.  We let it go on but some expressed the view that it should be stopped.  That did not happen and we await the report.There is clarification with regard to granting legal representation, which always causes problems.  Anyone called as a witness, some of whom would never have dreamt they would have any role in a discussion on planning in Dublin, must appear and be questioned.  They are worried and need legal counsel and assistance.  It is important that this is clarified at the start and that they know the financial position.  In the US, people associated with the Clintons in the 1990s were almost bankrupt due to the legal costs of various investigations.  I would not like to see that happening here.  The Bill will hopefully make changes.Much depends on the judge in charge of tribunals.  I am not sure if there is a requirement that the chairman of a tribunal be a judge.  It should not have to be a High Court or Circuit Court judge who runs a tribunal.  There are plenty of people who may not be legally qualified but who could be advised by senior counsel and junior counsel for the tribunal on how to operate.  Maybe we should look for people with an arbitration or mediation background who could see how these matters can be resolved without the inquisitorial manner used up to now.I welcome this Bill.  Let us get it passed and let us hope that it is a long time before we establish any more tribunals.

It is interesting to listen to Deputy Byrne discussing whether he was a donkey.  I will leave that to someone else to discuss.  He referred to costs.  Is he suggesting legal secretaries should be on the minimum wage, carrying out work that is important?  Given the advent of scanners and the like, which should be used more, material can be put on a disk and people can peruse it on a computer.This legislation is welcome because we need new legislation to govern the work of tribunals.  Existing legislation dates to 1921 and it is clear that spiralling legal costs and the refusal of witnesses to co-operate with tribunals must be addressed.  There is much in this Bill that I would love to welcome but, as currently drafted, we will oppose this Bill.We were not the ones who delayed this Bill, as suggested by Deputy Byrne.  The reason this Bill has sat in the background since 2002 is to save the former Taoiseach's blushes while he was before the tribunal and so that he would not be seen to introduce a Bill that would ensure the process of tribunal investigations would be stifled.  That is the reason for the delay.  I would prefer this Bill to be withdrawn and the points I make addressed before a Bill is put to the House.We are concerned that the proposed legislation could be used by future Governments to stop inquiries from delivering the truth to the public and the families of victims of collusion.  The Bill, as currently drafted, is very similar to the Britain's Inquiries Act, which is widely viewed as having been constructed to act as a barrier to a full public inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane.  The president-elect of the US, Barack Obama, has supported this.  Passing this Bill would jeopardise the ability of any future tribunal to uncover the truths surrounding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the murders of Seamus Ludlow, Councillor Eddie Fullerton, Martin Doherty and many others that must be addressed in full public view.  It would undermine the cases of those in the Six Counties seeking inquiries into State collusion.The British Government could point to this legislation in this jurisdiction to justify its own legislation.  This Government signed an all-party demand for a full inquiry by the British authorities into the murder of Pat Finucane not so long ago.  This Bill would greatly undermine that demand.  The British could point to the restrictions under this new legislation to justify the Bill introduced to prevent a full inquiry into the Pat Finucane murder.  British Irish Rights Watch says that its fear is that if the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill is passed, it would seriously undermine the Irish Government's support for the Finucane family and other families who deserve a proper public inquiry.  Governments here and in Britain, past and present, have colluded in deep cover-ups, masking the truth and compounding the suffering of victims and their relatives.  Recovering the truth is essential if the suffering is to be lessened.Not so long ago, we organised a conference in Dublin on collusion in this State.  Representatives of the families spoke at that event, which was well-attended.  Speakers included those from Justice for the Forgotten and the Pat Finucane Centre, the Relatives for Justice and the families of Seamus Ludlow, Councillor Eddie Fullerton, Martin Doherty and Pat Finucane.  I pay tribute to them for their courageous and enduring efforts to uncover the truth and achieve some justice for their loved ones.  The Bill before us would effectively give the Government power over whether to establish an inquiry at all, its members and, crucially, its terms of reference.  It would also give the Government the power to suspend or dissolve a tribunal for unlimited reasons and to prevent the publication of a tribunal's report.  This is unacceptable and will not instil any confidence among the public or, more crucially, among those who have been specifically affected and who are seeking the full truth of the events the tribunal was set up to address.I want to put on record some of our specific concerns.  Section 34(7) allows the Government, acting on the opinion of a responsible, or perhaps irresponsible, Minister to direct that the report of a specified part of it not be published for a specified period or until the Government otherwise directs where such publication would not be in the interest of State security or in the interest of the State's relations with other states or international organisations.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I am happy to have an opportunity to speak about this issue.  In the context of the cancer programme on which the Government has embarked, there are a number of priorities from a clinical point of view.  Clearly, the first priority is to ensure that we organise our cancer services to deliver better outcomes for patients.  The manner in which our cancer services have been organised do not deliver good outcomes for patients, as we know, and do not compare very favourably to many other European countries in most cancers with the exception of children's cancer.  It is centrally organised in Crumlin hospital and, therefore, we do extremely well compared to the experience in other countries not only in Europe, but elsewhere throughout the world.  We do not do so well with other cancers.  Our priority during the past 18 months has been to invest in putting in place eight designated centres with a multidisciplinary team of experts to be able to care for patients who are diagnosed with cancer.A second priority is screening programmes.  Many other European countries and countries beyond Europe have been involved in screening programmes for some considerable time.  We are currently rolling out a breast screening programme, which will be completed during next year for those five counties to which it has not yet been rolled out.We are also rolling out a cervical screening programme that began in September.  Cervical screening has the capacity to prevent 80% to 90% of cervical cancers.  Some 70 to 100 women present with cervical cancer each year.  A national screening programme for women aged between 25 and 60 years of age has the capacity to eliminate the incidence of cervical cancer by 80% to 90%.  Therefore, there was a choice presented with the roll-out of the cervical screening programme, which next year, in a full year, will cost €35 million.  An extra €25 million will be allocated to that programme next year and an extra €15 million will be allocated to the cancer control programme to allow Professor Keane to continue to recruit the expertise we require in these eight centres to provide, in particular, multidisciplinary care.  That €50 million funding has been identified for those two programmes.In the summer of this year following a health technology assessment, I announced, based on the advice I received, that we wanted to introduce the vaccine from the school year beginning September 2009.  The HSE believed at that time that this would be a challenge and in that context sought to defer it, as health services often do with computer systems and so on, but we believed it should be rolled out at the earliest opportunity.  In a statement I made on 5 August, I said that it should be rolled out subject to two criteria, one being that it be cost-effective.  Two companies supply the vaccine.  One of the vaccines deals with four strains of HPV, of which there are 200 strains in all, while the other vaccine can eliminate two strains.  I sought the introduction of the vaccine, subject to its cost-effective procurement and securing an 80% take-up of it.  All the advice is that if we do not get an 80% take-up of it, we will not get the benefit of introducing it.  Therefore, the permission of parents of 12 year old girls will be sought.  It was subject to those two criteria that I sought Government funding in the context of the Estimates for 2009 to begin the roll-out of the vaccine next September.Since then, as we know, there has been a considerable decline in our economic circumstances.  Next year, for the first year in almost 11 years, health spending will not increase by 8%, 9% or 10% — the average annual increase has been 9% since 1997.  Next year the increase will be just over 3%, which will present a challenge.  As I said in the House during the debate on the medical card issue, when one has to find €700 million of planned expenditure for 2009 from the health Vote, it is a considerable challenge.  There is no low-lying fruit in health — no easy pickings.  Therefore, it was obvious that something that had not yet begun should not begin next year when we did not have the resources to do it.  We must also consider this decision in the context of the pneumococcal vaccine, which has been rolled out to infants in respect of which there is a catch-up period of up to two years.  That will cost €30 million next year to prevent certain meningitis strains.  It is not a question that the decision on the vaccine was made in isolation, rather it was made in the context of many other big decisions that have been made.I was asked parliamentary questions by Deputy Reilly and one of his colleagues on Tuesday and queries were also raised by a journalist.  I gave the truthful answer that we would not be in a position to provide money for this during 2009.  As the American presidential election took place the same day, I was accused of trying to go undercover and making the announcement on the day of that election.  When parliamentary questions are asked, I believe they should be answered truthfully and people should not be misled into having a false view that sometime next year this vaccine would be introduced when I knew in my heart of hearts that I did not have money to do it.When the HSE sent me its plan a few weeks ago and we discussed it with Department officials during the past two weeks, it was clear to me that we could not provide the additional resources without taking them either from Professor Keane's cancer control programme or scaling down the screening programme that has begun.  I believe that when we begin something, we should do it well.  Therefore, when it came to clinical choices, we had to continue with the decision that gives the best clinical return.  The best clinical return is in regard to screening.  That prevents 80% to 90% of cervical cancers, as we heard from Dr. Flannelly on the radio this morning.  This vaccine has the potential to prevent 70% of cervical cancers, but the women to whom the vaccine would be administered would also have to be screened — it is not a question of either-or in this case.Many other countries have introduced such a screening programme for cervical cancer.  The UK introduced such a programme 20 years ago.  We are only doing this now because, unfortunately, we had different priorities and did not have the resources of other countries to be able to introduce a cervical screening programmes 20 years ago.  Our screening programme, as everybody here knows, only began this year in September.  The announcement on Tuesday was not that we were scrapping the vaccine.  What we said was that it is not being introduced from September next year.There will be a challenge for the HSE in terms of when the programme can begin.  One would hope it could begin as quickly as possible, but I cannot say that it will be introduced in 2010.  I hope it can begin then, but I cannot give that guarantee now, unless the resources can be made available to do it.  I hope we will able to introduce it as early as possible.  Other European countries have not been in a position to introduce it either.On the issue of the cost of the vaccine, it has been suggested that three doses of the vaccine would cost approximately €600 or €200 each.  I do not know if that is the case.  The HSE has estimated to me that for a full year it would cost approximately €16 million.  The administrative cost of the vaccine is in the region of €6 million.  As procurement of it has not taken place, I cannot say, with certainty, what the cost of vaccine would be, except I understand it has been suggested that if people can procure it privately, it would cost approximately €600.When the HTA was done for me by HIQA, it said it would cost €390 for the vaccine.  There are approximately 27,000 girls aged 12 in Ireland.  We want to get an 80% take-up of the vaccine.  On the assumption that we would, which was the only basis on which we were going to proceed with its introduction, it would cost in the region of €11 million for the vaccine alone and €6 million for the staff to administer it and for other non-pay and IT systems because we have to be able to track the people who are given the vaccine over a considerable period of time.I am happy to explain the circumstances in which this decision was made.  We wish we could make all the decisions that would benefit the health of our citizens all at once, but when it comes to priorities, clinical issues must come first. The clinical priority based on all the advice available to me as far as cancer is concerned is to continue with the reorganisation of services, which next year will require an additional €15 million for Professor Keane and to continue with the roll-out of the cervical screening programme to 1.1 million women, which next year will cost an additional €25 million over the €10 million that was provided for this year.  That amounts to €50 million for those new cancer initiatives.Regarding other issues, like the pneumococcal vaccine, etc., it was not possible to make resources available to the HSE from the autumn of next year to begin a programme in either national or secondary schools.  It costs approximately €500,000 less to provide it to secondary schools because there are fewer of them.  However, in terms of getting the consent of parents, we know who the national school students are and my view was that it might have been easier to reach those parents and get their consent in advance, which is required to administer this vaccine because we are concerned here with minors.  Regardless of whether it was available in national or secondary schools, we cannot begin the programme in September 2009 as envisaged.  It needs to be postponed for that reason.

She stated that she had considered all the advice available to her of the potential public health benefits of the HPV vaccination in the prevention of cervical cancer and the wider policy implications of its possible introduction into the national immunisation programme.  She said:I accept the expert advice that the introduction of a universal, high uptake, vaccination programme for young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer rates.  I intend to seek Government approval for the programme and for the required funding in the autumn based on the implementation of a plan that can be shown to be cost-effective, in terms of delivery costs and uptake rates.She went on to say "It is clear the main priority now is to move to the introduction of the vaccination programme for 12 year old girls to commence in Sept 2009".  It is worth noting that this was only a month after the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance had met in July and examined the financial situation in which the country had found itself.Furthermore, the Minister has told the country that she circulated this news on the day that the country was consumed with events in America.  I had tabled parliamentary question to her and I wish that all parliamentary questions I table were answered with such efficiency and speed.

I am given to understand that report was available more than a month ago and was in the hands of several people but held back.  I believe this represents cynical manipulation of the news.The Minister mentioned the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Its board considered the cost benefit analysis of the programme and recommended that the Minister institute it.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee also recommended the introduction of this vaccine programme.  These are two organisations that are concerned with the public good and public health.  I cannot understand why she has now chosen to ignore their advice.I wish to put on the Dáil record the figures quoted by HIQA.  It believes it would be possible to avert 2,244 cases of CIN1 based on the figures for cases that occurred in 2004.  In the case of CIN2 and CIN3 — these are all pre-cancerous lesions — it would be possible to avert 1,435 of those.  Of the 200 cases of cervical cancer in 2004, it estimates that 111 of these cases could be prevented.  Of the 93 deaths that occurred in 2004 from this disease it would be possible to avert 52.  These are stark figures.  For the sake of €10 million are we going to expose our children of today and our women and mothers of tomorrow to the dangers of death, pain and suffering as well as the heartache to their families?The Minister has talked about putting the patient first and not affecting front-line services.  This is a crossroads for us.  In response to parliamentary questions, Deputy Ring was able to ascertain that the Government is spending €10 million on press secretaries, press officers and constituency staff.

Every time we have a problem the answer is to establish another committee, investigation, task force or commission, with money flying out the door.  I remind Members of the Government's approach to money in the not so distant past when one Minister said of the €50 million spent on electronic voting machines: "What about €50 million in the overall scheme of things?"  What about €10 million for the lives of children who may not get the opportunity to live to old age because of not having this vaccination programme?  It has been recommended by two Government bodies.  The Minister was congratulated when she announced it.  I wanted to see it extended to 18 year olds as is done in the UK and in the North.  Australia has had it since 2007 for women up to 26 years of age, but we cannot do it here.  It is about priorities.  The Minister is telling us that out of a €16 billion budget she cannot find €10 million to protect the future of children.HIQA has stated this programme would cost €9.7 million.  The Minister has given other figures here as to the cost of the vaccine.  I would know from hearing on the grapevine that a hard deal done by the Government could result in no moneys being paid for the vaccine next year or the year after and that the suppliers might be prepared to wait until 2010 to receive their moneys given the economic climate in which we are all operating.  While I agree the Minister is making hard decisions, it is with alarming frequency that those decisions are always hard on the patients and on front-line services and not hard where they need to be, on bureaucracy, waste and negotiations.The Minister has her advisers with her today.  We know that for every €1 spent on prevention it is possible to save €20 on treatment.  I put it to her that this is penny wise and pound foolish.  We are at a crossroads.  This is a moral decision for the Minister.  She should seek the money elsewhere from her €16 billion budget and protect those who need protection or else when she relinquishes responsibility in the area, she will leave behind her a heinous legacy.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The Minister opened her contribution by saying that her first priority was to have services that would result in better outcomes for patients.  Nobody in the House could disagree.  She said her second priority was the roll-out of the cancer-screening programme, which is a reasonable priority.  I do not understand how she comes up with her priorities and how they can be so changeable or interchangeable depending on the situation.  Deputy Reilly already quoted from the Minister's statement on 5 August, which is only three months ago.  She stated: "It is clear the main priority now is to move to the introduction of the vaccination programme for 12 year old girls to commence in September 2009".  I do not know whether her first or her main priority is more important, nor do I know what has changed since.The Minister also stated that she was "having regard for the need to prioritise in relation to budget and competing demands of other service programmes".  For this reason, she decided not to put in place the catch-up programme.  It was because cost was a consideration that 13 to 15 year old girls were excluded.The Minister did not raise this issue for the first time on 5 August.  Although I was unable to find the date, I raised this issue in the Dáil before the summer recess.  When I stated that the vaccination programme's introduction seemed positive, the Minister sat there and smiled.  Obviously, some degree of forethought was given to the 5 August statement.The outcomes cited by Deputy Reilly make understanding the Minister's decision more difficult.  Most victims of cervical cancer tend to be young mothers.  In addition to not vaccinating 12 year old girls, the Government is denying another group of children the opportunity to grow up with their mothers, given the chances of survival without vaccination.For as long as I have been a Deputy, the Minister has been stating that she is rolling out breast cancer and cervical cancer screening, but they are still being rolled out.  She is asking people to accept that the vaccination programme will not be available and to hope on the never-never that they will be able to avail of the screening programme.  Given the circumstances, this is a sizable request.  How do we know that, in a few months time, the Minister will not inform the House of delays in the programme or that it is no longer her main priority?The Minister used the phrase "when choices came".  There are always competing choices, but the Minister knew last August that the economy was in a difficult situation.  Given the mini-budget in July, she knew the situation we were facing when she made her announcement.  As the Government got its figures appallingly wrong, we must allow for the Minister not fully understanding the situation and relying on inaccurate figures while waiting for something more precise from the Minister for Finance.  However, she was aware of the difficulties when she made her decision.Will the Minister reconsider her decision and allow 12 year olds to avail of vaccinations?  She should not blame the requirement for an IT system.  We were vaccinated in school before there was an IT system.  It would be a poor excuse to use in 2009.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I was struck by the Minister's opening statement to the effect that her objective is to deliver better outcomes for patients.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has produced stark figures on how many deaths this vaccination would prevent, as well as on how many people and their families need not experience trauma, pain and anguish.  The Minister's decision, which is based on minor economic reasons given her Department's overall budget, flies in the face of her opening statement in respect of the patients and young women whose long-term health would benefit measurably from the vaccination.  It does not make sense.When the Minister made her announcement three months ago, she knew the budgetary situation.  From feasibility studies and investigations, she would have been aware of the programme's cost, but now the HSE's figures have put the programme out of reach.  It cites a cost of €16 million, but HIQA cites €9.72 million.  The latter also documents the savings achievable in terms of treatment costs per year, €2.7 million, and annual incremental costs, some €6.9 million.  In overall terms, the total amount is small and would have a considerable effect on young people's long-term health.The Dublin Well Woman Centre has condemned the move to scrap the vaccination programme, stating: "While short-term budget savings may be made by not proceeding with the vaccination programme, the reality is that unnecessary deaths will arise among the cohort of girls who were to be targeted".  While there will be a gain in the short term, we will pay a long-term price in terms of health and economics.  It is well known that €1 spent on disease prevention saves €20 on treatment.  It always pays to invest in preventative programmes.  I appeal to the Minister to find the money elsewhere in the overall budget.

I call on the Minister, Deputy Harney, to reverse her decision immediately.  It would not be described as a U-turn and there would be no criticism.  Rather, it would be described as a humane, caring and life-saving measure.Only three short months have passed since the August announcement, which was made despite what we already knew of difficulties in the public finances.  Presumably, the manner of funding was discussed with the HSE.  This morning, it was suggested on radio that the HSE does not have money to fund the programme.  I urge the Minister to reconsider, as the programme would save 50 lives.  We are a developed country and can surely introduce long-term preventative measures such as this to save lives.Within the overall budget, the amount of money in question is small.  I dispute the Minister's figure, but I will revert to this matter shortly.  It is closer to €10 million.  Deputies have suggested other ways to find the money.  For example, we do not need so many Ministers of State.  This immediate saving would be a considerable contribution.  Regarding the variety of consultancies used by the HSE, it has farmed out a number of jobs that it could do, including the writing of letters to all of the unfortunate patients in the north east who needed X-ray reviews.  Using a private company to administer the nursing home repayment scheme costs €15 million.  There are many ways to find the money.How does the Minister prioritise if this life-saving preventative measure, which would lead to greater health outcomes for women, is not a priority?  Not for a minute would I suggest that the money be taken from the cancer control programme or the roll-out of cervical screening or BreastCheck, the latter of which has not been completed.  These are not the type of programmes from which money should be taken.  Rather, it should be taken from areas such as consultancies, bonuses, extra Ministers or farming out to the private sector work that could be done by the large number of people employed by the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children, which has lost only a handful of employees since the HSE was established.  With a little will and imagination, it will be possible to find the money needed to re-introduce this programme.I want now to speak briefly about the cost of this programme.  The Minister suggested this morning it will cost €14 million to implement it.  She arrived at this figure by multiplying 24,000 by 600.  The Health Information and Quality Authority document published in February this year, suggests it would cost €100 per dose of vaccine and that if a school-based programme were introduced, which is what the Minister is suggesting, the administrative fee would be €30.  This amounts to closer to €10 million than €14 million.  I ask that the Minister revisit this issue in that context.  Also, given there is competition between the companies that produce the vaccine, it should be possible to negotiate a price that is lower than the €100 quoted.I am afraid that what is lacking is the political will to address this issue.  With political will, savings could be made in a variety of areas to enable this vaccination programme to be implemented at reasonable cost.  Following announcement of the vaccination programme, I spoke to a mother of a young girl who is approaching 12 years.  She had already explained to her daughter that she was going to get this vaccine.  She, and other mothers, now have to explain to their daughters that while they had told them they were going to get a vaccine which would prevent them getting cervical cancer in the future — a difficult enough issue to explain to a 12 year old — they may well be 12, 13 or 15 years old before the programme is introduced and as such they may not get the vaccination.I urge the Minister, given the relatively small cost involved and the value of this programme, to reconsider her decision.  Despite the fact that we are in recessionary times, we are a relatively rich and developed country and we should be able to find the wherewithal to introduce programmes that will have positive results for future generations.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Information about this programme is in the public domain.  While children may not know about it, their mothers do.  Mothers are the greatest pursuers of all that is good for their children and they will pursue this issue and will want to know why their children cannot get this vaccination.  There is not one person in this House, or outside it, that has not been affected by cancer diagnoses or by the death of someone from cancer.  We all know, including those who have been caught in time or cured, the stress of living in a house with a person who receives a cancer diagnosis.  We know the outcomes could be so much better.Mothers know this vaccine is available and that it could prevent their children going through the trauma of a cervical cancer diagnosis, treatment and, hopefully, cure.  It will, in the event of a cure not being possible, prevent their children dying from cervical cancer.  We are all aware there are other cancers, the outcomes of which are not great and the treatment for which is harrowing, but there is no vaccine to prevent them.  There is available, however, a vaccine which will prevent cervical cancer and provide our children with hope of a better future.I plead with the Minister to reverse this decision.  The cost of implementing this programme will not be €14 million.  My information is that doctors who administer the vaccine in a private capacity will do so for €115 per dose.  The Minister and I know that families who have the wherewithal and the resources will ensure their children get this vaccination.  This will create a two-tier system.  We will have a cohort of young women who will be vaccinated because their parents can afford it and another cohort of young women whose parents cannot afford it.  We should not allow this to happen.  These children may encounter similar problems later in life when it comes to housing, third level education and employment.  We should not allow this to happen when we can prevent it.  It is our job to ensure all children are treated equally.I believe this particular scheme could be introduced at a far lower cost than that stated by the Health Service Executive.  I do not blame the HSE for saying it will cost more than we can afford.  At the end of the day, the €16 million saved as a result of not implementing this programme can be spent by it somewhere else and we will have no control over this.  It is what the HSE did in the disability and mental health areas.  It will spend that money wherever it sees fit and neither the Minister nor I will have control over it.What we do have control over is whether this programme is introduced.  It is a programme that will benefit all of us.  This is not only about death but about harrowing experiences.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	415	While this issue is about protecting women's health it is also a class issue in that women living in areas of disadvantage will now be three times more likely to get cervical cancer than the average person.  These are the young women who will lose out because of this decision.  People who can afford to pay will be able to access the vaccination and people who cannot pay will suffer, which is unacceptable.  I do not think even the Minister believes this is acceptable.  It is disappointing the Minister has not prioritised this issue.The Government's record in regard to early detection and diagnosis of cancer is abysmal.  BreastCheck has not as yet been fully rolled out.  Our extraordinary limited roll-out in terms of cervical cancer screening dates back to the Rainbow Coalition and the cancer strategy.  There has not been, up to now, a commitment in regard to the roll-out of the screening programme.  In this instance, however, we have a vaccination programme that will prevent rather than detect cervical cancer.  Our record, even in tough times, has been good in terms of vaccination programmes for children.  One need only recall in this regard Dr. Kathleen Lynn of St. Ultan's Hospital.  During the 1930s and 1940s, a time when there was no money in this country, children were given the BCG vaccination.  We are now saying, in 2008, that young women cannot be vaccinated because the Government has too many Ministers of State.  We have 21 Ministers of State costing, salaries aside, €500,000.  Yet, we cannot find the €10 million required to implement this programme which will prevent young women from getting cervical cancer.  This is not acceptable.I urge the Minister to reconsider her announcement in this regard.  I do not believe anyone would blame her if she were to say she was sorry and admit that she got it wrong; they would applaud her for it.  We all appreciate the difficult economic times in which we now live but to deny young women and children this opportunity to protect themselves is wrong.  We often speak of death by a thousand cuts, this is death by one cut, one cutback that will affect the lives of many women.  These women's lives could be saved if the Minister reverses this appalling decision.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	416	The €600 cost per child of the vaccination referred to by the Minister this morning on "Morning Ireland" is dishonest.  That the Minister and the Health Service Executive are seriously considering a cost of €600 per girl for the three-stage vaccine is not only dishonest, it is incompetent.  The Minister's figure is approximately €115 and 21% VAT per vaccine shot, with three shots of the vaccine, amounting to approximately €400.  There are then costs of administration by doctors and HSE overheads of another €200 approximately per girl.The Minister must know that for these sorts of costs, she could offer every girl a medical card for the year.  This is meant to be a national vaccination programme and is actually only deliverable as such.  The only way to implement a national vaccination programme is through a school or health clinic structure on a mass basis.If the Minister was to roll out a national scheme, the two vaccine suppliers could be negotiated with and the costs would be significantly less.  I understand that in other countries it is about a third of the Minister's indicative costs.  The programme and vaccine doses would be supervised by doctors but more likely administered by nursing practitioners.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting GPs should be paid for three visits at approximately €50 per time?  That is crazy.  No wonder the HSE is in a financial black hole if this is the kind of health economics which the Minister has come up with.Given her long experience as a Minister, I am surprised Deputy Harney has so comprehensively had the wool pulled over her eyes.  The Minister delayed this programme for a year to allow a cost-benefit analysis to be done by HIQA.  If these are the figures produced by the authority, somebody there should stand down.  If the Minister is attempting to stand over these figures, she should consider standing down herself.  I know at the weekend the Progressive Democrats are likely to be stood down and her mandate in this Government will be at an end.Some 70 women a year die, usually in great pain, from different types of cervical cancer.  Many of us know friends or family who have died from this disease.  The young girls relevant to this scheme would get the disease years to come; I hope it will be long after our time.  There is a thought that 70, 80 or 100 of today's girls, along with their future families and children, will go through suffering for absolutely rubbish economics.  If the Minister has come up with these economics, perhaps the whole Government should resign.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I welcome the opportunity to address the cancer issue today.  The decision by the Minister for Health and Children to cancel the cervical cancer vaccination programme is an absolute disgrace.  The Minister announced the programme only three months ago but it has now been axed.  The manner of the announcement was also a disgrace as the news was sneaked out under the door on the day of the US presidential election.  The press release was apparently timed to go out after the Order of Business concluded in the Dáil, and as usual, it was late in the day, which made it difficult for Opposition spokespersons to respond.The programme was designed to prevent the development of cancer in women and the Minister's hatchet job is another attack on public health by a Minister and Government whose stewardship of our health system has been disastrous.  This public health programme is among the first to go on grounds of cost yet the budget left intact the tax breaks for developers of private hospitals.  Estimates for the cost of the vaccination programme vary between €10 million and €14 million, yet in 2006 — the latest year for which figures are available — this Government gave tax breaks worth €10.6 million to the developers of private and for-profit hospitals.In a budget that has slashed public services, those tax breaks were untouched, although they could have paid for this vaccination programme.  Also untouched in this budget was the Minister's and Government's totally discredited private hospital co-location scheme.  The Progressive Democrats may be about to disappear, as the previous speaker said, but its Thatcherite policies are alive and well in this Government.Savings could and should have been made on the tax breaks for the private health industry and not on programmes which will enhance the health of women and prevent much greater cost in future, both in terms of the well-being of individuals and the cost to the health service of treatment.Irish Cancer Society chief executive John McCormack said the Minister's decision to cancel the vaccination programme is "very disappointing".  He stated: "If this is going to be the beginning of a pattern around hard-fought decisions being reversed, the Irish Cancer Society would be awfully concerned about it".  This is a cancer prevention measure and €1 towards prevention is as good as €2 towards a cure.  The Dublin Well Woman Centre has indicated the Minister's decision is both shortsighted and dangerous.  The CEO of the centre, Alison Begas, said it was an illogical move that will cost even more in the long term.  These are the voices the Minister should be listening to.  We should not forget that we are talking about preventing cancer and saving the lives of women.Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women under 45 and the third most common cancer in Ireland's women.  Almost 200 women in the State, on average, develop the disease every year.  In contrast to most other cancers, this type affects mainly younger women, with 60% of cases occurring in women aged 50 or younger.  Approximately 70 women in the Twenty-six Counties die from cervical cancer each year.A survey last year showed that only 29% of Irish women are aware that a vaccine for cervical cancer exists.  Despite cervical cancer being the second most common cancer for women under 45, three out of four women did not know what caused the disease.  It must be known as widely as possible that this cancer can be prevented by means of a simple test — the cervical smear test.  It is a scandal and disgrace that successive Governments failed to roll out a national testing programme and that only this year is progress being made in this regard.On 24 February 2005 there was a unanimous call from the Irish Cancer Society and 24 other organisations, including trade unions, professional bodies and women's networks, for a State-wide pre-cancer screening programme.  Comprehensive screening, leading to early detection and treatment, can and will dramatically reduce the incidence and development of cervical cancer and the resulting all too terrible death toll.There is still far too little information to show women that screening can save lives.  Information and screening must be as widely available as possible and there must be quick progress in moving the screening programme forward.  We have heard much from this Government recently about the excellent cancer service being developed across this State.  We have heard about centres of excellence and I have seen a move in my own constituency, for example, where much of the Dóchas breast unit is being moved to Dublin.I will relate an incident which happened recently.  One of my constituents went to her GP four weeks ago with a concern about a breast issue.  The GP shared her concern and referred her to the Dóchas centre as normal, and the doctor had not been advised of anything different.  Over three weeks passed and she heard no word about an appointment so she phoned the centre in Drogheda to find out the date of her appointment.  She was told that the Government had told the HSE to close the service, which is to be transferred to Beaumont in Dublin, and she had to contact that hospital because appointments were no longer being made in the Dóchas centre.When she contacted the Beaumont breast clinic for the date of her appointment, she was told it was not making appointments.  The clerk told her a pile of referrals was sitting on a desk but nobody had been put in place to arrange the appointments.  In other words, this Government has begun closing services again on the pretext it is introducing better services, although this is not the case.  No preparation has been made in that respect.Is the Government not giving any consideration in such decisions to the stress and trauma suffered by the women involved and their families?  Is there any appreciation in the health service or at Government level of the sheer worry, sleeplessness and torment brought about by these cases?  This is what is happening.The HSE wrote to GPs in the Dóchas catchment area on 23 October advising them they should make their referrals directly to Beaumont Hospital.  However, that was a little late.  It suggests the HSE was transferring patients to Beaumont at least two weeks before it informed the GPs what was going on, thus causing referrals to be processed by the Dóchas centre and sent on to Beaumont, which constituted a significant waste of time.The Minister should comment on this development and whether she considers such treatment to be appropriate.  Moreover, my constituent involved in this case received a letter from the HSE advising her that she had an appointment with Beaumont.  It states, "we are writing to inform you that an alternative appointment has been made for you at the breast unit at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin".  This was sent to her in writing but when she telephoned the hospital to ask when was her appointment, she was told that no appointments can be made because no one has been assigned there to arrange such additional appointments.  She was also informed that because arrangements had not yet been concluded for the transfer of the consultants from the Dóchas centre to Beaumont, no one would be available to deal with her appointment in any event.  The Minister should comment on this because some accountability in this regard would be timely.The letter to my constituent also stated, "Many of the staff who have worked at the Dóchas centre will be moving to Beaumont Hospital to provide the new improved centralised service and we will continue to put you, the patient, first and ensure your health and safety are our primary concern".  Nothing in this story demonstrates the Minister has patients at the centre or that they are her primary concern.  Everything pertaining to this matter suggests this is another hatchet job designed to slash a service available to women in the north east and to centralise it into a service that is not ready to receive them and which will cause additional travel, pain and suffering to the patients involved.  The Minister should comment on this scandal.This week the HSE produced another review about the north east, the so-called look-back review of cancer patients.  It demonstrated that of those concerned, at least one woman had a 60% chance of survival.  Unfortunately she did not get that chance and has died.  This is merely one of a litany of events in the north east.  I will share some of them with the Minister, who may be divorced from some of it.  The most recent event is the review of the X-ray scandal that was published on the day of the US presidential election.  Second, I raised today the scandal in respect of the Dóchas breast unit.  Third, there are issues regarding the report of Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark into the Michael Neary episode — I refuse to call him "Doctor" — as well as the lack of an appointment of a clinical auditor.  This still has not happened and therefore the possibility that abuses of that nature will recur is wide open.Fourth, grave concern has been expressed pertaining to issues regarding the Rape Crisis Centre and the services provided to women in the north east. A significant number of representations have been made to me in that regard.  Fifth, the ongoing scandal of the symphisiotomies never has been dealt with or cleared up.  Although an external review was promised, nothing has happened in this regard.  More than 400 such symphisiotomies were performed in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  In conclusion——

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Very well.  I will continue to raise the important issues associated with the deaths of Tania McCabe and her son Zach, again at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.The Minister should address some of the issues I have raised because the crisis appears to be worsening.  Statistics show the incidence of cancer is increasing throughout the State.  Unfortunately, it continues to increase in my constituency and adjoining areas and many believe this is due to the toxic fall-out from the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield.  No inquiry, study, or survey has been carried out or set up in the area to try to establish the reason the incidence of cancer in the north-east region, and in County Louth in particular, is constantly between 12% and 13% above the national average.  Why has the Minister for Health and Children not sought to deal with the high incidence of cancer in the area?  Why, in common with her predecessors, is the Minister not concerned about this matter, despite calls from me and others to deal with it once and for all?  No benchmarking has been put in place in respect of the incidence of cancer and it appears an approach akin to sleepwalking has been taken without any consideration for the seriousness of the issues involved.I will revert to the central point regarding cervical cancer. As I pointed out in the earlier part of my contribution, great savings could have been made in other areas.  While €10.6 million in tax breaks has been provided for the developers of private hospitals and private health care, the Minister is slashing this scheme for women that will cost between €10 million and €14 million.  Surely an accounting exercise on the costing of such services would indicate clearly that, as one of the people to whom I referred observed, €1 spent on prevention is worth at least €2 spent on cure.  Does the Minister accept the logic of this argument?  The Minister should comment on this because it would be worth hearing her response.Whatever the outcome of next Saturday's events outside this House will be, I hope the consequences will be that a different Minister for Health and Children will be in place thereafter.  In particular, whatever about the Minister, a different policy should be in place in order that the people in this State will begin to get the public health service they deserve.  Such a service has not been evident today.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	423	As I asked some questions during my original contribution, I will be brief.  This is a political decision that only the Minister can reverse.  A good manager or leader decides where savings can be made.  This is a direct judgment on where the Minister's values lie.  Does she make savings in administration, bonuses for the bosses, bureaucracy and through redundancies or does she do so at the expense of the future prospects and lives of young women?I have never tabled a motion regarding the Minister's resignation before the House.  However, unless she reverses this immoral decision, she should consider her position because if she does not, I will.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I will not respond to the political charges that Deputy Reilly continually makes.  I do not need a lecture from him about moral responsibilities and will not take one.  However, one must make choices based on clinical advice.  Ireland only began a cervical screening programme last September, which will save 80% to 90% of cervical deaths.  Were we in a position also to introduce the vaccine, up to 70% would be saved ten years on.  This would be a belt and braces approach.As I explained earlier, the cost of the screening programme next year will be an additional €25 million.  The cost of Professor Keane's cancer control programme is an additional €15 million.  In other words, an additional €50 million is going into cancer prevention and cancer control next year to achieve better results.  Ireland still does not have a colorectal screening programme and there are many areas in which our programmes fall short.  Ireland is not unique as many other European countries have not yet decided to introduce this vaccine.  I understand that seven or eight other European countries have not done so and we are not alone.  I would love to have been able to do it because it would be a belt and braces approach.

Did she seek to make the saving anywhere else before she changed her mind, or did she take comfort in the fact that — as she rightly said — she is spending money on the cervical screening programme and on the cancer control programme?  Did the Minister try to find the money somewhere else?What would the Minister say to a parent who cannot afford the fee but who feels his or her child should have the vaccination?  Would she suggest that he or she would borrow the money to have it done?Does the Minister question the figures shown on page 38 of the HIQA report of 25 February 2008?  A table shows the cost estimate for the school-based universal HPV vaccination programme.  A three dose course is estimated at €300 for the vaccine and €90 for the administration fee, which comes to a total of €390.  This morning on the radio the Minister referred to a cost of €600 per girl.  How can she stand over the figures to which she referred this morning?  Does she accept the figures on page 38 of the HIQA report?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I did not say the cost would be €600 this morning.  I was responding to what Dr. Flannelly had said in an earlier part of the interview with Cathal MacCoille in which he expressed outrage that the cost of the vaccination to parents would be €600.  Of course I accept the HIQA costs.  The Health Service Executive recently made a submission to me that the cost would be of the order of €16 million.  I never accepted that a computer system was needed.  That is why I wanted the Health Service Executive to start the programme next year and not to wait for a further year for a computer system——
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Why did the Minister insist it would start next year?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	439	——that would cost a further €500,000.  In response to Deputy Burton's question, the cost of vaccines here is approximately three times higher than in other countries in terms of GP charges.  This vaccine would be administered by nurses and the Health Service Executive's estimate of that cost is approximately €5 million.I accept the figures for costs outlined in the HIQA report.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked me what changed my mind.  When I made the announcement in August after the health technology assessment I said the programme would be introduced subject to two things.  The first was that we could get the vaccine on a cost-effective basis and the second was that we could get an 80% take-up from parents.  The advice is that if one does not get a penetration level of approximately 80%, then it would not be effective to introduce the programme.  Subject to those two caveats we were going to introduce the programme from 2009 if we could get the money in the context of the Estimates.What has changed dramatically since August is that in the context of next year the Minister for Health and Children was required to take €700 million off planned expenditure for 2009.  That is not easy to do.  There is no low-lying fruit here; it is not easy pickings.  The decision was to continue with the screening programme because that would save women who have cancerous cells and pick up women currently at risk.  That must be the priority.  That programme will cost an extra €25 million next year.  We have to organise our services to get better outcomes and that requires €15 million to be given to Professor Keane to recruit the expertise to allow us to establish the eight designated centres.  Treatment for people with cancer and picking up people who have cancer have to be the priority.Of course I want to see the vaccine introduced as quickly as possible.  In August, I accepted that we could not do the catch-up for cost reasons.  We would love to do that too.  Unfortunately, we cannot do everything unless we have the resources.  Therefore, I had to make choices based on the clinical advice, which said that screening prevents 80% to 90% of cancers and picks up the women now who are at risk of cancer while treatment deals with people who have cancer.

I would like to see the Health Service Executive service plan for 2009 debated in the House.  It is clear that the public health service will be challenged financially next year to provide services in a range of areas because of the financial situation in which we find ourselves.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	442	This is a morally reprehensible action by the Government and the Minister for Health and Children.  She should not tell me she cannot find €10 million out of €16 billion expenditure.  She proclaimed — as did the Government — that there would be no cutbacks in health in 2009.  It was said there would be no cutbacks in health and education, but now we are talking about a cutback of €700 million.In response to Deputy O'Sullivan, the Minister stated that of 60,000 births, 50% are female, which is in or about correct, giving a total of 30,000 girls.  If we take 80% of the total that gives 24,000, which is probably high compared to most vaccination programmes.  I understand the current cost of administering the vaccine to 12 year old girls is €115 per shot plus VAT.  When that is multiplied by three, the total is €345.  When that is multiplied by 24,000, one gets a total of €8 million — if one wishes to add VAT the total is approximately €10 million, not €14 million as the Minister indicated.

Is that the Government's intention?A procurement agency operates within the Health Service Executive.  How successful is it at getting value for money for this kind of product?  Surely it should be able to secure savings of approximately 10%?  That would be significant and might reduce the overall cost from €10 million to between €5.5 million and €7 million.  Has the procurement agency provided value in this regard?The situation may well arise where the Minister is challenged legally by virtue of the fact that she said she would introduce a programme but she did not do it.  She backed off in a morally reprehensible way.I noticed last week that the Taoiseach was in Carlow turning the sod at the Merck Sharp & Dohme plant, which will mean a major investment in the future.  That is to be commended.  I understand also that this plant was to manufacture the product and supply one product on a worldwide basis.  That was like an invitation to the world to come to our country, invest in our infrastructure and give us jobs, yet a couple of days later the Minister for Health and Children announced she was getting rid of the programme announced in August for the product that is made by that company, which has such a bearing on the quality of life for young girls as they grow into adulthood.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	445	To clarify, we are not cutting €700 million.  I referred to planned expenditure.  If we are to do all the things we would like to do next year, we require an extra €700 million.  In fact, health spending is increasing by 3.1%.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Minister could drop the bonuses.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	447	In that context, many tough decisions have to be made.  The priority in cancer, which is very important, has to be that we improve the quality of treatments by investing in the expertise we need in the eight designated centres.  That was €15 million.  That money had to be found.  It is not easy to find such sums of money.  If staff costs account for up to 80% of one's costs, one has to find savings from the remaining 20%.  We also want to continue with cancer screening because it picks up women who currently have cancer and treats them.  That saves 80% to 90% of women, which is a very high success rate.  Many other countries have had screening programmes for 20 years.  We have only been running one since September.We are getting very good value since the central procurement agency was established across a host of areas in the Health Service Executive.  On capital plans, for example, I am advised that it is getting reductions of 20% and 25% on what was envisaged.  The HSE cannot go to procurement unless we give it the money to procure.  As Deputy Kenny well knows, one cannot go into a tendering situation to procure unless one will be in a position to honour that procurement.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	448	The agency could tell the Minister the figure if it could procure.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	455	If I can answer the question, we would then seek the money in the context of next year.  In the context of next year, it became a question of trying to continue with the programmes we put in place.  I am sure Deputy Kenny would agree that there is no point starting something new if we cannot sustain it.  The best thing to do——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	456	There is no point in announcing it either.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	457	It was announced in good faith subject to those two caveats.  The best approach is to ensure the screening programme will be fully operational next year, which will be achieved through an extra €25 million and the treatment plans.  Many other European countries have not introduced the vaccination programme, for very similar reasons.  It is a question of making clinical choices based on the best outcome.Deputy Kenny should note it is not that we have scrapped the programme or that it will never be put in place, but that we are saying we cannot start it next September.  It was appropriate to make that clear.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	458	The Minister is admitting defeat in respect of finding €10 million out of €16 billion.

One must also consider the procurement stage for the vaccine.  It costs a lot more in Ireland to have vaccines, as Deputy Reilly will be aware.  Smear taking costs substantially more here than in the United Kingdom.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I want to Minister to explain the breakdown that results in the figure of 12,000 girls per year at a cost of €600 each.  I understand from a radio broadcast this morning that this is where the figure of €15 million is derived.  The figure simply does not stand up to analysis.  Although we have the tables from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, I rang a family planning clinic before I entered the House and was told it is €115 per dose plus 21% VAT and that three doses are required.  This amounts to approximately €400.  If doctors are being paid a full fee, depending on the location, the cost of each visit amounts to between €50 and €60.  Are my statistics correct or not?The HIQA tables indicate a cost of €390 for three shots of vaccine under a school-administered programme.  I presume there is no VAT because the service is State provided.  The doctor service costs €475.  The Minister delayed the programme to have a cost-benefit analysis carried out.  Why does she accept that the vaccine cost in Ireland should be exorbitant?  This is Bush economics and a case of the private corporations commanding premium prices for public products because of the Minister's policy of privatising the health services.  I am thankful the sun is setting on Bush economics in the United States and hope it is doing so here.  How can Deputy Harney, who has been Minister for a significant period, stand over the economics of these costs?  If she is seriously contemplating that family doctors or individual health clinics should charge the fees I mentioned, it is a resigning issue.  The programme can be administered by nurse practitioners.Does the Minister recall that one of her predecessors, Dr. Noel Browne, was able to eliminate TB at a time when the country did not have tuppence?  Although our circumstances are not as favourable as they were, we are still very rich and cannot offer the comfort of positive programmes.  In Africa, countries with very few resources have universal immunisation programmes for children in respect of a range of conditions.  Children in Cork and other areas are not able to receive ordinary immunisation after birth because the system the Minister oversees is fundamentally broken.  She should provide a breakdown of the figures.  If she cannot do so now, will she do so later in tabular form?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The cost to which I refer concerns public sector workers.  I am not talking about the cost in respect of drug companies but of the cost of the labour of public sector workers.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Is the cost of each shot of vaccine not €115 plus VAT at a rate of 21%?  The vaccines are provided by private companies.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	471	It is outrageous.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	472	In respect of the following year, we cannot start a programme we cannot continue.  We cannot give one shot of vaccine in 2009 and not give the two remaining shots in 2010.  Everybody will agree that, if we start a programme, we should start it well and continue it.  That is what we are doing with the screening programme and the cancer control programme.  Deputy Perry should note the same issue will arise when we begin colorectal screening——

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The figures for 2006 alone are the latest figures available.  The Government gave away €10.6 million in tax breaks for developers of for-profit hospitals.  How can the Minister justify giving this away when a smaller sum would have provided a vaccination programme to prevent cancer in women?  The Minister should go back to the drawing board, scrap the tax breaks and put the money where it should be, that is, into delivery.  It should not be spent on private for-profit hospitals that enrich people when there are women crying out for the vaccine.  What is being done is totally immoral and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	483	We need infrastructure in the health service and capital allowances have proven to be a very cost-effective way of delivering infrastructure, particularly in the nursing home sector.  Very many patients are in private nursing homes that probably would not have been built if it were not for encouragement through the tax system.  It is not a question of "either-or".We cannot introduce the vaccine in the school year beginning in September 2009.  It is hoped and intended that, pending financial circumstances, we will be in a position to introduce it very quickly thereafter.  It is a belt-and-braces operation to have a vaccine and screening programme.  They complement each other.  The vaccine prevents certain strains but not all types of cervical cancer.  Therefore, we must have the two approaches.  It is not the case that one can stop the screening if one has the vaccine, as Deputy Enright said.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I do not believe she said that.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The Minister stated screening should be the priority.  Will she explain why only €750,000 has been allocated for centres of excellence.  She has found ten reasons not to implement the vaccination programme and this is an appalling indictment of the Government.  She cannot find €10 million out of €16 billion.  As Deputy Reilly stated, 50 lives could be saved with this money.  I am tired talking about value for money, audits and the assessment of costs; what is occurring is appalling when one considers the amount of money that has been wasted.Will the Minister confirm that Professor Keane has made no contact whatsoever with the oncology team in Sligo?  This is an appalling indictment of the Government.  Although there is talk of transferring the screening service out of Sligo General Hospital, no contact whatsoever has been made with the hospital by Professor Keane.  There is no BreastCheck service and this affects 4,000 women.  The Minister is all over the shop on this.  Although lives are at stake and the Minister stated screening is important, screening is not taking place.  Two beds were to be allocated to Galway University Hospital for the whole north west and we are now told there is to be only one.Deputy Reilly stated correctly that lives are at stake.  The Minister is sacrificing the lives of 50 people to save €10 million — that is the kernel of the problem that arises today.  If the Minister cannot find €10 million out of €16 billion, something has gone frightfully wrong.  It is an appalling indictment of the system and points to ineptitude and bad management.  It is a disgrace.  I call on the Minister to reverse her decision.

I have told him so before in this Chamber.  With regard to the saving of lives, ten or 20 years from now 50 lives will have been saved but 81 lives can be saved through the screening programme.  I say to Deputy Perry that this must be the immediate priority, to pick up the women today——-

The priority is to pick up today, through screening, those women who are prone to cervical cancer and then to provide quality assured treatment.  That is what we are doing and that is why an extra €50 million is going into cancer next year, notwithstanding the economic circumstances.  That is a fact.  We cannot do everything at the same time.  I wish we could.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	518	The Minister is a person for whom I had great admiration.  Whenever I was asked, locally and nationally, who was the person outside my own party I most admired, I said the Minister was that person because of what she has done over the years, as a Minister and as a Member of this House.  However, my respect for her as a Minister has definitely diminished this week.This morning, I had a call from a constituent who told me she had e-mailed to the Minister for Health and Children a photograph of her 12-month-old baby daughter.  In her e-mail she asked the Minister to choose whether she wanted the person in the photograph to be alive or dead in years to come.That is the question I pose to the Minister and it is the one that people outside this House pose to us as public representatives.  We are asked, as messengers of the people, to pose that question to the Minister.  This is to save a measly €10 million.  When one sees the wastage in the health service over the past number of years under the Minister's stewardship, it is shameful that the Minister comes into the House and gets rid of this service.I return to my original point.  The Minister said in her statement that this action would save lives.  I ask her, as a public representative, to change her mind on this and to reverse what she has already done.

I will not respond to the question about whether I care that people die.  If I did not care, I would not bother to organise these services.  It would be much easier not to face as I do, in this House and around the country, any opposition to the re-organisation of services.  This is being done for only one reason, namely, to deliver better treatments for cancer patients——

It is a choice that I face along with many of my ministerial colleagues throughout the rest of the world, including those in the European Union.  Does Deputy Reilly believe that these Ministers spoke lightly when they said they would not introduce the vaccine this year?  Of course they did not.Third, I will address the question of the 12-month-old daughter of Deputy Kehoe's constituent.  We have introduced a pneumococcal vaccine to prevent that child getting particular strains of meningitis, at a cost of €30 million next year.  We do these things and we do them as fast as we can, within the resources we can make available, and we do them to a very high quality standard.  The screening programme we have introduced is of a high standard and that is what is important.  We are doing all these things.We do not say that we will not introduce the vaccine.  We are simply saying that we cannot do so in September 2009.  We are not saying that we will abandon this programme or that we will scrap it.  I accepted the advice that the vaccine is a good product that should be introduced and I want to see it introduced as quickly as possible.

She can find €10 million.  She can give us 20 reasons not to do something rather than find one way to make it happen.  I already covered that with her.The Minister made the argument that she has choices to make.  The choices are not between cervical screening and cervical vaccination but between front line services and bureaucracy, taxis, meetings and bonuses for the bosses.  Those are the choices.  What about the 5,000 redundancies that we were supposed to see?  We have not seen them.The Minister says she cannot do this.  I quote the President-elect of the United States: "Yes, we can."  I say to the Minister that if she does not reverse this decision, and if the Minister of State beside her, Deputy Andrews, does not do so, she will be forced to vote on this matter, and on her future as Minister for Health and Children, on the floor of this House.  This is a step too far.  We are at a crossroads in this country where the choice is between Boston or Berlin.  We know the Minister has gone to Boston in respect of health care but the country is not going with her.  The people aged over 70 will not go with her because of the medical card issue; disabled children will not go there with her, children with special educational needs will not go with her and the children affected by today's decision will not go with her either.

In August the Minister said, and has repeated as much today, that she would roll out this programme in September next year subject to cost and to a take-up of 80%.  We already brought the cost down today.  It appears from the debate today that the Minister accepts that the cost will be in the region of €10 million.  I ask the Minister to do two things.  Perhaps she cannot officially do them but unofficially somebody might talk to the pharmaceutical companies who supply the vaccine in order to investigate whether we might get it at a cheaper rate than the estimated €100 per vaccine.  I believe we can.Could we also check whether the schools are happy to administer the programme?  The Minister's other proviso was for an 80% take-up.  If the vaccination can be done through the schools, I am confident that she will get that percentage take-up.  Might we then see if we can find the remainder of the money somewhere within the Health Service Executive budget or within some other aspect of Government?  It is not a great sum of money.  Might we leave this Chamber with some type of positive hope that we can actually bring in this programme next year?  That is what the people want to hear.  They know we have arguments in this House and that we shout at each other across the floor.  What they want is a positive result.If the Minister can turn around her decision she will be seen as humane, caring and life-saving.  I put it to her that if she does these things, if she reduces the cost, gets the agreement of the schools and finds the money, that we will all have done a good day's work.

Several other Ministries have not done so either, for the many reasons we face here.  Clinical choices must be made based on the best clinical advice when there is public money to spend.Concerning Deputy O'Sullivan's point about cost and take-up, I said earlier that I accepted the health technology assessment which advised that the introduction of this vaccine in Ireland would be a good thing.  We want to have it as quickly as possible and I had hoped to introduce it for the school year beginning in September 2009, subject to 80% of parents agreeing that their daughters should receive the vaccine, and that it be cost-effective.  That cannot happen next September but I hope it can happen soon thereafter.

My party is concerned that the proposed legislation could be used by Governments to prevent public inquiries delivering the truth to members of the public and the families of victims of collusion.  Arguably, certain collusion findings which should be made public in the interests of truth and justice may damage the State's relationship with Britain and the European Union, of which both states are members.  The Government should not have the broad discretion to suppress findings on these grounds.Further, it is likely with regard to inquiries into collusion that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be the responsible Minister.  Since the establishment of the Free State, some Ministers for Justice acquired a track record in misusing and abusing their powers on purported grounds of State security.  This has resulted in harassment of individuals and the destruction of their characters and livelihoods, with consequences for their respective families.  In a recent case, a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform leaked to the press details about a named journalist on the basis that he considered it was in the State's interest to do so.  However, in so doing, he effectively destroyed the livelihood of the individual in question.We have had cases of people being taken before special courts and sentenced to terms of imprisonment on the word of one person, despite denying the allegation being made against them.  Power has also been abused, particularly by a previous Minister for Justice, Mr. Paddy Cooney, who stood over the heavy gang without any accountability.  We saw the consequences of this and the then Minister's failure to uphold his obligation of office to protect civilians when innocent people were locked up in prison.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The events of the time are well documented.  The heavy gang operated under the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Paddy Cooney, and we had brutality, seven days' detention and the denial of basic human rights.  These are known facts.Part 4 includes provisions for appointments to tribunals.  The absence of a requirement to secure Oireachtas approval gives the Minister too much discretion in the making of appointments.  The Bill lacks and would benefit from the inclusion of explicit progressive criteria for suitable appointees and a transparent, merit-based mechanism for identifying and approving the appointment of members of a tribunal.The Government may dissolve a tribunal with the approval of the Oireachtas.  While it must state its reasons for so doing, the Bill, as drafted, does not limit what these reasons may be.  The Bill should explicitly provide that a tribunal of inquiry may only be dissolved prior to the submission of its final report for extraordinary and compelling reasons which clearly outweigh the public interest in the tribunal completing its work.  On the requirement to secure the approval of the Oireachtas for dissolving a tribunal, we have had many cases of Government Deputies and Ministers rowing in behind a Minister, irrespective of their personal position on an issue.  Effectively, therefore, a Government can do as it wishes provided it has a majority in the House.The Bill would also benefit greatly from the inclusion of provisions allowing for an international dimension to inquiries, in particular where there is a possibility of State collusion in serious human rights abuses.When the Bill was first published, Deputy Ó Snodaigh wrote to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, outlining Sinn Féin's concerns.  The Government has discussed these matters with my party's leadership team.  Despite our best efforts to have the Bill withdrawn, the Government seems determined to press ahead.  It is an astonishing affront to democracy that the Fianna Fáil Party, with the support of the Green Party and remaining Independent Deputies, is pressing ahead with this legislation.  It will not be lost on members of the public that a Government led by Fianna Fáil, the political party most associated with being on the wrong side of tribunal investigations, is seeking power to stifle such processes.  Former Ministers who came before tribunals in the recent past were responsible for decisions which were not in the national interest.  I refer specifically to the decision to give away our natural resources which should be exploited for the benefit of the people.Many people inside and outside the House have serious concerns about this legislation.  A much better mechanism could be established.  Insufficient consideration has been given to the provisions of the Bill and in the interests of justice and truth, I call on the Taoiseach to withdraw it for the reasons outlined.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  This is a comprehensive reform and modernisation Bill dealing with an important issue.I make it clear that there is no question that the Government will withdraw the Bill, as requested by Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Ferris.  The Bill cannot and should not be construed in any way as compromising the position on calls by the Finucane family and others for an inquiry by the UK Government.  The Government has taken a clear stance in support of such an inquiry, as expressed by the then Taoiseach on 8 March 2006.  I have been present at many meetings since that date at which the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the current Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, called on the British authorities to hold an inquiry into the Finucane case in accordance with a previous understanding on which the Governments agreed.It is inevitable that there will be some similarity between the Bill and the United Kingdom Inquiries Act 2005.  This is primarily engendered by the common roots of both the Bill and the Act in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, which is a UK statute.  However, there are significantly different experiences in the usage of the Act in the two jurisdictions.  This is especially the case when one has regard to the relevant Irish jurisprudence.Deputy Ó Snodaigh's concerns regarding section 34 are misplaced.  The section imposes a clear statutory obligation on a responsible Minister to publish the tribunal's final report except where, in the Minister's opinion, to do so would prejudice any civil or criminal proceedings that are in progress or pending or would not be in the interests of State security or in the interest of the State's relations with other states or international organisations.  In the former instance, where the Minister is of such an opinion, he or she must apply to the High Court for directions concerning the publication of the report.  The court may direct that the whole or a part of the report be not published for a specified period or until the court otherwise decides.  This provision is in aid of parties to any such proceedings and obliging the Minister to apply to the court is considered to be a necessary and sensible safeguard.  In the latter instance, the responsible Minister must give notice of his or her opinion and reasons for that opinion to the Government. Where, having considered the opinion, the Government is satisfied that publication of all or part of a report would not be in the interests of State security or the State's relations with other states or international organisations, it must determine whether the delay in publication of all or part of the report should be for a specified period or until it directs otherwise.  The House will appreciate that failure on the part of the Government to take steps to protect State security or international relations would undoubtedly lead to accusations that the Government was in dereliction of its duties.It is ridiculous to suggest that somehow section 34 is a "charter for cover-ups", as was referred to earlier.  This ignores the fact that a tribunal is a public inquiry, except where the chairman determines that a particular session or module should be held in private.  Therefore, most if not all sessions of an inquiry will take place in public.  In practice, the Government would have to notify the Houses of the Oireachtas of any decision to withhold from publication the whole or part of a report of an inquiry.The Bill provides for the reform and consolidation of the current legislation relating to tribunals of inquiry, dating from 1921.  It will put in place a modern statutory framework governing all aspects of the operation of a tribunal, from the time of its establishment to the publication of its final report.  It will, we believe, provide a more efficient and cost-effective method of investigating matters of public concern.  The Government, at the time of the passage of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 2004, committed itself to look at the legislation concerning tribunals in a comprehensive way and to develop proposals to amend and consolidate it.  We indicated then that the anticipated final Report of the Law Reform Commission on Public Inquiries would likely have a major influence on our legislative intentions.  We have followed through on that indication.  The Law Reform Commission report was published in May 2005 and contained over 50 recommendations that would lead to more efficient and effective management of tribunals.  The Bill before the House relies heavily on the commission's report.It is disappointing that, notwithstanding the heavy reliance on the Law Reform Commission report, the Second Stage debate took place against the background of unsubstantiated Opposition claims that the bringing forward of the Bill was a political attempt on the part of the Government to somehow intimidate the Mahon tribunal in advance of the anticipated appearance of the then Taoiseach before that tribunal.I stress a point made by my predecessor in that debate, that the Government believes it is important that future tribunals should be more efficient and cost-effective.  That view is shared by the vast majority of taxpayers, including the vast majority of Members of this House, who have expressed frustration at the mounting cost of tribunals time and again.  Now that the Mahon tribunal has completed its public hearings, I hope this Bill can be given the objective consideration it deserves.I remind the House that tribunals of inquiry are the only statutory form of public inquiry available to the Oireachtas to inquire into any matter of urgent and significant public importance.  The main legislative vehicle for the public investigation of such matters is the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, as amended by a sequence of legislative measures enacted between 1979 and 2004.It may be useful to recall the amendments to the original Act that were found necessary over that period.  The need for the amendment usually became apparent in the course of the work of the relevant tribunal so the development of the law in relation to tribunals has been piecemeal to say the least.  It really is time for a comprehensive overhaul of this legislation.  In this regard the House should consider the following examples.The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979 remedied certain defects that had emerged in the course of establishing the inquiry into the Whiddy Island disaster.  That Act created a number of offences for non-co-operation with a tribunal.  It provided a statutory basis for the establishment of multi-member tribunals.  It also provided for the summoning of witnesses, compelling the production of documents, the issuing of a commission to examine witnesses abroad and, importantly, allowed a tribunal, where there were sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so, to make orders for the payment of the costs of a person represented before it.The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1997 was a direct response to the McCracken tribunal and included a power for the tribunal to direct that its costs could be paid by a person who had caused them to be incurred through his or her non-co-operation.The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Acts, Nos. (1) and (2), 1998 allowed for the changing of a tribunal's terms of reference at the request of the tribunal or following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister.  The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 2002 included provision to enable additional members to be appointed to a tribunal, as was necessary in the case of the Flood tribunal.The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 2004 was necessary to ensure that Judge Mahon, as the new chairman of the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, previously chaired by Mr. Justice Flood, could make orders regarding applications for costs incurred during the tenure of the preceding chairman.  One can therefore see that much of the legislation we have in this area was, as I said earlier, piecemeal.  It is fitting we should bring it all together in one consolidated item of legislation, which this is.Deputy Flanagan, in his Second Stage contribution, referred to the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 and considered that this Act:addresses issues that have been highlighted by those who wish to see an end to tribunals in Ireland, namely costs, duration and tight terms of reference.  This legislation provides that when issues of significant public concern emerge which heretofore would have necessitated the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry, they can instead be dealt with by a commission of investigation.  That more straightforward and efficient approach was deemed appropriate by Members of this House several years ago.  Therefore, we are unlikely to see many, or any, new tribunals being established in the future.A commission of investigation differs from a tribunal of inquiry in one very important respect — it is an investigation in private as opposed to the public nature of a tribunal.  The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 provides the Oireachtas with the possibility to set up a private investigation into any matter considered by the Government of the day to be of significant public concern.  It was never the intention that the passing of that Act would obviate the need for any future tribunal of inquiry if the Oireachtas considered such to be merited.Indeed, in this regard I need only refer to the establishment by the Oireachtas, subsequent to the passing of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, of the public inquiry into the fatal killing in 1989 of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Robert Buchanan under the chairmanship of Judge Smithwick.The extensive powers of tribunals set up under the tribunals of inquiry legislation have facilitated them in establishing the facts in respect of certain matters of serious public concern.  A tribunal of inquiry has a wide range of powers which, as I have said, have been strengthened in successive items of legislation to secure the co-operation of persons with their inquiries and there are significant sanctions for persons who fail or refuse to comply with a direction of a tribunal.The commitment to bring forward comprehensive legislative reform given at the time of the passage of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act in 2004 has now been fulfilled.  We have built on the excellent work of the Law Reform Commission Report of May 2005 and the Bill implements, in large part, the recommendations contained in that report.  The Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 marks, I believe, an important milestone in the development of our legislation in relation to tribunals.The costs regime in the new legislation will provide for greater controls and transparency in relation to costs incurred on foot of tribunals of inquiry.  The House may wish to note that the cumulative cost of all tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigations at 31 August 2008 was almost €355 million.  This sum relates to completed and ongoing inquiries.  Of this, €96 million related to administration costs, €134 million to tribunal legal costs and almost €125 million to third party legal costs claimed to that date.  The latter figure is expected to increase substantially with the completion of almost all of the existing tribunals.My predecessor, when introducing the Bill, indicated that a number of likely Committee Stage amendments had been agreed with the Office of the Attorney General.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate on the Bill and bringing forward these amendments.I believe the provisions of the Bill will put in place an efficient and cost-effective inquiry mechanism in regard to public inquiries the main features of which include the process for establishment, suspension and dissolution of a tribunal as set out — a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required in each instance; the situation with regard to the granting of legal representation before a tribunal is clarified; the chairman is required to conduct the inquiry in a cost-effective and efficient manner; the situation with regard to award of costs by a tribunal is clarified — co-operation with the tribunal remains the key determinant for an award of costs; and regulations, to be made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, will set out maximum amounts of legal costs recoverable.This Bill will provide for a more efficient and cost-effective operation of any future public inquiries which the Oireachtas ordains to be established.  I believe it will be in the best interests of justice and public accountability that we move forward with these Bills.I wish to comment on some of the remarks made by Deputy Durkan.  With regard to people criticising me for raising the issue of the Morris tribunal, the more I listen to the comments of others, the more I am reminded of a statement we hear often, that people tend to "shoot the messenger".   We cannot come in here and set up a tribunal, ask it to investigate allegations of all sorts and then dump on the chairperson and his recommendations.  Deputy Durkan said Mr. Justice Morris had no right to inquire into the modus operandi of Deputies.  He most certainly did, as is clear under the terms of reference we gave him.  Therefore, while we may not agree with all the recommendations of these tribunals, it is incumbent on us to accept them, given we set them up in the first place.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	553	When I introduced the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act to this House, I made it clear the disruption in international financial markets required a strong and decisive response by the Government to underpin the commitment of the authorities to Ireland's financial stability.  This Government moved swiftly to put in place a guarantee to ensure Irish financial institutions' access to the normal liquidity and funding for their day to day business, and to give confidence to depositors and wholesale lenders.  The Government quickly demonstrated its resolve to support the financial system in order to support in turn the economy and society, enterprises and families.In tandem with the guarantee, the intensified scrutiny and oversight of financial institutions put in place since the onset of the turmoil in financial markets has been maintained and further strengthened to ensure that high standards of regulation are achieved in Ireland and that the quality of corporate governance applying in all institutions, including lending practices, safeguards the interests of taxpayers.  The goal at the end of this process is a banking system that is fit for purpose for the transformed financial environment in which it will find itself operating in the coming decades.The Government continues to work closely with the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank to monitor, assess and ensure the stability of the system and flow of credit.  The functions set out in the legislation, following consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, are specifically provided to protect the stability of credit institutions and maintain the financial stability of the State.  The legislation provides a detailed framework for the authorities to oversee and guide the assessment of strategic options by the banks themselves.  The Irish scheme is firmly aligned with the main themes of the euro group plan, which contains an option to provide additional capital resources where appropriate to the banks.  The position is being assessed and monitored on an ongoing basis.Each institution must take appropriate steps to ensure their levels of capital are aligned with their needs.  The State has a keen interest in the health and security of the banking institutions because of their role in the economy.  My Department, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator will be in continuing contact with the institutions on their business plans, capital position and liquidity.  If it is the case that an assessment is made by a particular institution, or by the regulator, that higher capitalisation would be appropriate, the first step is for the institution itself to consider all possible options to meet this requirement.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	554	Does the Minister agree there is now mounting evidence credit to strong and viable enterprises is drying up, and there are more and more examples where people have had their overdraft facility cut back and are having to lay off staff in the face of credit problems?  Against that problem does he agree the issue of the adequacy of the capitalisation of our banks is now a major source of focus and one of the reasons they are finding it hard to raise term deposits externally?  Others have moved to higher capital ratios being required.  The banks may meet the minimum criteria set by the regulator but no longer look to be strongly capitalised by comparison with other countries.Does the Minister believe it is within the banks' own capacity to resolve their capital problems?  If, as the Minister says, he believes private sources of funds would be the best first option, does he agree there must be clarity on the Government's approach before people will risk private equity in any recapitalisation?  Government policy — with the new powers — could have a very big impact on private investors' views of putting capital into a bank.

Statistics show the degree of funds attracted to the Irish banks as a result of the liquidity——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I spoke about long-term deposits.

He would appreciate I was going to make the point that the degree of liquidity attracted by the banks through the guarantee was actually greater than the amount of liquidity available to the banks as of 1 September.  On that date, as Deputy Bruton is aware, the difficulties had not yet emerged that led to the giving of the guarantee in late September.On the question of capitalisation, as part of the review of the banking system now taking place, the question of the adequacy of capital ratios must be examined because of the position that now obtains in other European countries.  I have made it clear at all stages that my view and that of the Government is that capitalisation by the State must only be an ultimate and last resort.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	560	The central question is if the approach of the Government, in saying banks must exhaust all other options before there is a question of the State becoming involved in recapitalisation, risks this problem festering?  In the process, genuine businesses could be starved of credit, which will in turn prolong the difficulties in the economy.  There is a worry the Government is sitting back on its oars when other governments have moved ahead with other actions.  I say this without seeking to prejudice what they may be.  We are stuck at base camp one while others have moved on.

We did not rest on our oars in giving the guarantee in the first place.  Our political difficulty in Europe was that we were ahead in giving the guarantee.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	564	The credit institutions financial support scheme provides a guarantee for covered institutions until 29 September 2010.  I have been advised by the Financial Regulator that it recently commissioned PriceWaterhouseCoopers to conduct a review of loan portfolios of the covered credit institutions.  PriceWaterhouseCoopers is currently progressing with this work and the Financial Regulator will keep me advised of progress as appropriate.  Deputy Burton will appreciate this review is highly commercially sensitive.Given the general deterioration in the economic conditions, both national and international, the Financial Regulator has advised that he would expect the current levels of impairment in covered institutions to increase over the next few years.  The expected levels of impairment charges for particular institutions will be dependent on borrowers' financial position and the level of collateral provided.  The regulator's review of the loan books of the covered banks has shown that the covered institutions did not hold any exposures to the US sub-prime mortgages and also they have limited exposures to banks which have recently been liquidated or encountered difficulties, including Lehman's and the Icelandic banks.  It is also important to note that the covered banks continue to be profitable.With regard to the availability of credit, the extended international credit crunch we have experienced has brought home to all of us the pivotal role of the financial system in the economy and in the day to day lives of ordinary people.  One of the stated objectives of the scheme is to maintain financial stability, not for its own sake but in the best interests of the public and the economy of the State.  The scheme helps the banks access additional liquidity which will allow the banks to continue to lend in a sustainable manner, supporting the appropriate availability of credit and favouring business activity in the wider economy of the State, especially trading activities.  The scheme therefore includes the application of strict terms and conditions on covered institutions to ensure the public interest, which includes the general consumer and small business sector, is paramount.It is the responsibility of the covered institutions to ensure they meet capital requirements and I expect covered institutions to take appropriate steps to ensure their levels of capital are aligned to their needs.  My Department, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator will be in continuing contact with the covered institutions on their business plans, liquidity and capital position.The Deputy inquired about the estimated contingent liability of the scheme.  As previously stated by me it is estimated the scheme will cover liabilities of approximately €440 billion.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	565	First, that answer is inadequate given the difficulties faced by the Irish banking sector and because, at present, banks in effect are cutting off the pipelines of credit to many small, medium and large businesses, as well as to many individual borrowers, including those who seek to purchase homes.  This is about Main Street and not our equivalent of Wall Street.  The Minister only appears concerned about the Irish equivalent of Wall Street.  He is not concerned about what is happening to local businesses.  Will the Minister publish the details of the terms of reference of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers review, in which the Financial Regulator stated he intended to drill down deep into the balance sheets of Irish banks?  The Minister should provide some evidence of what such drilling comprises and what it covers.  The reason I stated the Minister's answer is dishonest is that I wish to address the gaps in his answer.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	566	The Deputy did not say that.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I stated his answer was less than adequate.  Allow me to rephrase what I stated.  The Minister stated the regulator knows the Irish banks in the scheme are not necessarily exposed to sub-prime mortgages.  Everyone knows that already because the sub-prime business was only beginning to get off the ground in Ireland.  The Minister also stated we are not exposed to, for example, fall-out from the US banks or Lehman Brothers.  However, he avoided what I wish to know, namely, the exposure of every bank in the scheme to bad-risk construction lending and lending for land speculation.  That is where the risks are, particularly in respect of two of the institutions covered by the guarantee.  The Minister should answer that question.  As for the contingent liability of €440 million, did the Minister not acknowledge to me last Thursday that there is no cross-indemnity between the banks in the scheme, contrary to what the Minister and the Taoiseach had implied?  Is it true that the first port of call on the €440 million now is Joe and Josephine Taxpayer?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I never have visited Wall Street and my fundamental concern in this matter——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	569	The Minister ought to.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	570	——is to ensure the Irish banks have the capacity to ensure the economy remains viable, businesses continue to thrive and consumers can borrow.  As for the Deputy's reference to the inability to acquire housing finance, the Government introduced an initiative in the budget to address that specific issue in cases in which the banks failed to advance credit.  While I would welcome the opportunity to visit Wall Street, there has been too much to do in the Department of Finance since my appointment to take time out and visit such an institution.As far as the terms of reference and the requests made of PriceWaterhouseCoopers are concerned, I will examine the request made by the Deputy and will forward such information as I can within my possession.  As for the exposures of the banks, the purpose of the exercise commissioned by the regulator with PriceWaterhouseCoopers is to assess that degree of exposure and bad risk on the asset side in the loan book.  That element of risk may not necessarily be connected exclusively with construction or investment in land.  It may relate to other loans and advances that financial institutions have made.  However, the purpose of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers inquiry is to establish the extent and depth of such exposure.As for the issue of the cross-indemnity and the guarantee, the Taoiseach and I have always made clear that were any deficiency to arise, the financial sector would be levied for it.  That was made clear at all stages and is reflected in the language of the scheme.  However, the particular reference to the scheme to which Deputy Burton refers is the specific legal obligation here and now on the institutions.  Deputy Burton is aware that no institution would have signed the guarantees under those conditions.

As for the cross-indemnity issue, I repeat it was never the case under the scheme that there was a cross-indemnity.  Deputy Burton is aware I never suggested there was such an indemnity.  However, a general undertaking has been given by the Government that any deficiency would be levied on the financial sector.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	582	Since budget day my Department has received the October data as regards tax revenue and expenditure, which are broadly in line with what was expected.  The October Exchequer returns showed an Exchequer deficit at the end of October of just over €11 billion.The Exchequer returns also showed that in the first ten months of the year, tax receipts fell approximately €4.3 billion short of expectations with all tax headings being behind profile.  In the month of October, there was a tax shortfall on profile of €693 million.  While tax receipts in October have continued the poor performance of recent months, they nonetheless are broadly in line with what was anticipated in formulating the recent budget forecast for the year as a whole.  In this regard, my Department anticipates a further slippage in revenues of approximately €2.25 billion in November and December, reflecting the fact that November is a key month for tax collection.  This will result in an annual shortfall of the order of €6.5 billion.As for the forecasts for 2009, the budget was framed against the most challenging fiscal and economic position for some time.  In 2008, my Department expects approximately €42.4 billion in tax revenue, followed by €42.8 billion in tax receipts in 2009.  This equates to a forecast of just 1% growth in taxes after the introduction of approximately €2 billion worth of additional revenue raising measures in the budget.  My Department does not believe that these forecasts are overly optimistic.  In its view, they reflect the underlying poor economic conditions that obtain at present.All forecasts, irrespective of the budgetary context, are subject to risks and are affected by developments in both the international and domestic economy.  This is especially so in the current circumstances, where it is unclear to what extent the upheaval in global financial markets will have a further impact on economic activity in the world's advanced economies. In this context, macro-economic forecasts for a small globally integrated economy such as Ireland, which also is experiencing a significant housing market correction, are even more uncertain than normal.  However, taking these risks on board, I believe the budget is based on a balanced set of forecasts from my Department.

The Department is projecting a 1% increase in tax receipts  However, although it projected an increase of 3% last year, a decrease of approximately 10% was experienced.  Several economic commentators have predicted there will be a decrease in tax receipts of the order of 9%.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	584	Is there a question?

Although the Government is predicting a rate of 7.3%, other economic commentators are predicting a rate of 8%.  As the Government may have overestimated tax receipts by €5 billion, will the Minister introduce a supplementary budget as a matter of urgency, rather than introducing stealth taxes through the Departments that will provide no confidence to the market and will be highly unfair to the public?  Will the Minister introduce a supplementary budget?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	586	There is no question of the introduction of a supplementary budget because the tax burden has been increased in the budget that was announced this October for next year.  An additional €2 billion in tax will be levied next year.  Members will have an ample opportunity to examine the detailed financial provisions during the passage of the Finance Bill.  Accordingly, an additional supplementary budget next year levying further taxation would in all probability inflict further damage on the economy.  In the current position, as Deputy O'Donnell is well aware, the great majority of our tax items that rest on discretionary purchases, be they houses, goods, alcohol or cigarettes, are seriously down and increases in those taxes would not lead to any increased income for the State.  The only option for the State in terms of further increases in taxation is increased taxation on income.  Increases on income, above and beyond the levy proposed in the Finance Bill, would amount to a substantial disincentive to labour in the year ahead.I have never suggested there should be a mini budget next year.  There has been considerable speculation about it and there was an inaccurate report in The Irish Times on Tuesday,which I am pleased to note it corrected today.  There is no question of a mini budget.  Of course if there is a deterioration in the public finances I will bring appropriate proposals to Government to address that.

He believes he will have a fall in growth of 1% but various economic commentators indicate it will be 3%.  How will the Minister meet the requirements of the European Commission in terms of general Government balance as a percentage of GDP?  Economic commentators say that will be of the order of 8% or 9% and the Minister's figure is 5.5%.  Does he not take seriously the warning from the European Commission?  How can he not introduce a supplementary budget?

The figure stated in the budget is 6.5%.  In its economic assessment the Commission estimated it would be 6.7% for next year, which is not broadly out of line with those of the Government.  There is a divergence of opinion between the Commission and the Government in regard to 2010 but I am satisfied that will be resolved in time as the Commission realises what measures we have adopted and their implications for 2010.

A range of organisations both in the public and private sectors produces forecasts at different frequencies during the year.  When preparing an economic forecast a wide range of different variables has to be considered.  All forecasts are subject to risks and are affected by developments in both the international and domestic economy.  I am pleased the Commission is broadly in line with the Government's forecasts for next year and I am working very closely with it on the operation of the Stability and Growth Pact.

The draft pay agreement, Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, provides for a pay pause of 11 months in the public service.  The private sector pay pause is to last for three months.  Furthermore, public service employers are required to achieve a 3% cut in payroll costs in 2009 and no specific additional provision has been made for the cost in 2009 of the increase provided for in the new draft pay agreement.  The cost of this increase must be met from within the approved allocations.Payroll costs are a function of staff numbers.  As I indicated in the Budget Statement, we must do more with less in regard to public service pay and numbers.  Where there are clear staff surpluses in certain areas, or where policy priorities change, staff numbers must be correspondingly reduced or re-assigned.The Government has already decided that a targeted voluntary early retirement scheme will be introduced for the HSE.  Discussions are under way on the development of such a scheme.  It is essential to extend such schemes, in a targeted manner, to other areas of the public service where surplus staff are identified.  In this context, the Government has decided to conduct a focused review of public sector numbers in all branches of Government to assess whether the resources are being fully deployed in an efficient and effective manner and what economies can be made.  This decision will be implemented when the report of the task force on the public service is received later this month.Public service pay levels can only increase at a rate that is consistent with budgetary discipline and national competitiveness.  I am satisfied the measures put in place support this stance.  As I have mentioned, we are keeping public service pay, along with other major expenditure categories, under ongoing review.  Should further corrective action be necessary, it will be taken.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I am seriously alarmed at the approach being taken by the Government on public sector pay.  In the past three months the Minister has committed to €2 billion extra pay, to be paid by taxpayers, between the September payment just ten weeks ago and the commitments to be made in the next two years.  Can the Minister afford to make that payment?  Does he believe the public finances can afford that payment?  Surely if we learned anything from benchmarking it was that one has to put a reform agenda on the table before one makes pay commitments rather than afterwards.  Why has the Minister made those commitments and is only now talking about a review within the public service and of the proposed reform and new policy agendas to get better efficiency?  Surely he should have taken the reverse approach and brought forward before the budget a radical reform agenda, which would see the restructuring of very expensive administrative overheads in many State agencies.Does the Minister not think it is lunacy to preside over a situation whereby when the HSE is short of money it closes beds and leaves staff to whom we are paying top dollar sitting around doing very little when patients are turned away?  What sort of public pay policy is it that results in that situation?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The agreement was the result of negotiations with the social partners, which did have regard to the difficult economic environment.  It is accepted by all the parties involved that the talks were among the most challenging and complex yet faced.  No specific additional provision has been made for the costs in 2009 of the increase provided for in the new draft pay agreement and those costs must be made from within the approved allocations.Early last July when I announced a round of savings throughout Departments, payroll and administrative expenses, as referred to by Deputy Bruton, were addressed.  The savings then targeted were achieved.  Likewise, in this budget right across the range of Departments, further payroll savings are required and will be achieved.  Public service reform is easy to discuss in the abstract but it requires hard, difficult decisions to be made on the ground.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	602	Does the Minister not agree that it is a parlous situation when 40% of our borrowing this year is going on day-to-day public spending?  If the European Union's projection is correct, and the Minister does not make €5 billion in savings next year, which he has not specified, we will be spending 60% of our borrowing just to keep day-to-day services going.  Are we not on a highly dangerous trajectory, and do we not need to address as a matter of urgency how we run the shop more effectively to ensure we do not waste money in administration and we protect front line services?  Where is the thrust for that in the budget?  What decisions were made in the budget that will deliver that?  I do not see them.

The bulk of the borrowing this year is to fund investment in the public capital programme.  That is where the bulk of the borrowing is concerned.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I said 40%.  The Minister should look at his own figures.

I agree with much of what Deputy Bruton said about the gravity of our position but the realistic way to look at the matter is to accept we are borrowing this year to fund approximately 10% of all our current expenditure.  I agree that is unacceptable.  It amounts in total to a borrowing of €4.7 billion, which will have to be paid for in future.

It is unacceptable but, given the rapid deterioration that has occurred this year, it is unavoidable.  We must take firm steps to eliminate it that will involve public sector reform in addition to taxation.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	615	As the Deputy is aware, the day-to-day management of the debt is handled by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and, as such, it is on its advice that the Government relies regarding the operation of our debt funding.The cost of raising long-term debt in the capital markets can be measured in relative terms compared to other countries.  This is known as the "spread".  In the case of Ireland, its cost of borrowing can be measured against the relative borrowing costs of other states, for example, Germany, The Netherlands, Portugal or Greece.  The spread to Germany is the benchmark measure and it is observed by comparing the yields on bonds of similar maturity.The recent turbulence in financial markets has been severe and this has been reflected in bond spreads.  Only time and an historical perspective will allow a true analysis of the causes and, more important, the relative weight that should be ascribed to the different factors.  As international difficulties have evolved over the past few months, all small and non-core sovereign issuers, such as Ireland, have experienced widening spreads.  Liquidity has been a major factor.  Most investors have focused on German Government debt as it is considered the most liquid investment.  This means German bonds can be readily accessed and traded, and also that there is a liquid futures market in German Government bonds to manage the associated market risks.  However, while spreads have widened against Germany, absolute yields have remained low or even decreased, depending on the timeframe, because of the extent to which German yields have fallen.Ireland's economic success has resulted in a relatively low ratio of debt to GDP and also a low absolute level of debt.  We have not been a frequent issuer of bonds which reflects both the relative size of the economy and the healthy state of the public finances for the past decade.  These positive factors have had the effect of contributing to liquidity difficulties for Ireland in the current market.There are a number of other factors in addition to liquidity that influence borrowing costs.  These include the state of the public finances, the borrowing required and competition for funding in the sovereign debt markets.  It is not possible to state the extent to which each of these factors will affect the spread in the future.The strategy underpinning budget 2009 is designed with the clear intention of restoring balance to the public finances over the medium-term cycle while having reference to the overall economic climate.  In doing so, the Government seeks to restore the current budget to surplus and to limit the level of borrowing required as order and stability return to the Exchequer finances.

Since the Government's guarantee scheme for the banks was introduced in September, the cost of Government borrowing increased by 0.6%.  The borrowing of €18.4 billion will therefore give rise to an additional cost of €91 million in interest payments.  The Minister has devalued the international credit worthiness of the Irish economy.  The reasons, as already stated by the Minister, include the state of the public finances.  The Government has not made the critical hard decisions.  In light of the bank guarantee scheme and the worry in the financial markets over the need for capitalisation of the banks by the Government, it is critical that the Minister introduce proper reform measures.  He will be borrowing in the order of over 35% to ensure a current budget balance.  I suggest he look at this figures again.With a view to lowering the cost of State borrowing, what does the Minister propose to do to inspire confidence in the international market in terms of the state of the public finances, the bank guarantee scheme and the capitalisation of the banks?

Deputy Stanton should note that my reply is in respect of the Vote held by the Office of Public Works only and that funding allocations for disability services pertaining to the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be dealt with separately by those Ministers, who will reply to the Deputy.Some €10 million was estimated in 2009 for the universal access programme, which provides for access to public buildings within the remit of the Office of Public Works.  Given the adjustments to capital allocations in the current economic climate, the funds allocated for this programme will be reviewed in 2009 in light of competing demands.In addition to the specific allocation and associated programme of works, it should be noted that all new buildings being designed by the Office of Public Works, including in respect of the decentralisation programme and all major refurbishments to existing buildings, will provide for full universal access.The 2006-09 capital funding allocation for disability services is €25 million in subhead E of the Office of Public Works Vote.  From 2006 to date, the office has expended €11,716,373 of this allocation.

Is he aware that the 2007 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General states the HSE has diverted funding in the order of €31 million from disability services?  This is causing considerable hardship.  What is the Department of Finance doing to ensure that spending by the HSE can be tracked to maintain the integrity of the Government's commitments regarding disability and mental health, both under multi-annual funding and other service plan elements?  Is he aware that the 2007 national service plan, as finalised, outlined an agreed level of health and personal social services to be provided by the HSE from 2007?  What role has the Department of Finance in signing off on this commitment?

He said that he had put in a saving of €17 million into his July savings Estimate in respect of disability.  In the budget he stated that he would expand it by €10 million.  How are we expected to follow these figures?  It appears to me that €7 million is missing.The Minister also stated that he asked everyone to cut back by 3%.  Surely there are people in the Department of Finance, not in the OPW, who look at the detailed budgets of each Department.  That is what they used to do.  The Minister does not appear to have an answer, however, as to how the detailed budget review is operating.  Can he explain that?

It therefore represents very significant progress in savings protection for credit unions.  In this respect, the strengthening of deposit guarantee arrangements is a clear demonstration of the Government's obligation to protect the whole financial system, to secure its stability and to ensure that all deposits in all Irish financial institutions are safe.In announcing the decision to increase the deposit guarantee level and to include credit union savers in the scheme, I stressed that the Government is committed to the stability of all of the Irish financial system, so that money placed with an Irish credit institution would not be at risk.I believe that the measure provides additional reassurance to all retail depositors in Ireland particularly as the new guarantee level is now among the highest in the European Union.  It was a particular priority for Government to look after the interests of credit union savers and to safeguard their competitive position in regard to the mainstream financial institutions, given the very important role played by credit unions in encouraging savings by all in our community.The action taken by the Government is complementary to the continuing discussions between the Registrar of Credit Unions and the representative bodies for credit unions regarding broader savings protection arrangements.  As Deputies will be aware, the existing Irish League of Credit Unions savings protection scheme, SPS, has played an important role over an extended period of time in helping to support credit unions that have experienced financial difficulties.Stabilisation mechanisms, if properly designed and effectively implemented, can play a very important role in maintaining as a going concern a credit union that is experiencing temporary liquidity difficulties.  It pre-empts the risk of failure and the need to activate the deposit guarantee scheme.There is, however, a shared recognition between all stakeholders that these types of arrangements must be modernised to take account of the evolution of the overall regulatory and financial environment.  It must be an objective for all relevant parties to work together on an intensive basis to come to a common position to the appropriate approach to credit union stabilisation for the future.  My Department will, of course, continue to work with the registrar and the representative bodies to support the achievement of this objective.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I have specific questions.  The Minister will know that should the credit guarantee scheme be called upon the money is recouped subsequently from all those who participate, including credit unions.  Is it preferable that the credit unions should be in a ring-fenced guarantee scheme?  They are entirely different in their risk profile from any of the other institutions covered.  They have, for example, twice as much in deposits as on loan, the opposite to the other institutions.  If they were ring-fenced they would not have a contingent liability.Second, there is a view from the League of Credit Unions that the savings protection scheme it now has should pay the premium into the fund for this protection and that it should continue to interface with the members.  Does the Minister support this view?  This would leave the savings protection stabilisation element as a core element and members would not say that because they had the Government's deposit they therefore do not need to be part of this.  What is the Minister's view?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	663	Deputy Bruton asked questions about legislation that is under preparation in my Department.  One of the great difficulties is that there is not a unanimous view among the different credit unions in Ireland concerning how this matter should be approached.  As Deputy Bruton correctly indicated, the League of Credit Unions has a particular view but there are other substantial credit unions outside the league that take a different view.  The approach of the league has been to have a stabilisation fund which operates as a guarantee to the credit unions affiliated to it.  The approach of certain other credit institutions has been that they want direct participation via the Central Bank or another appropriate institution with regard to the stabilisation moneys they save for deposit protection purposes.There is no consensus within the credit unions about how to go forward in this area.  I am anxious to devise a legislative solution that will accommodate the different concerns involved and that will ensure adequate protection exists for the depositor and adequate recourse will also exist for the taxpayer in respect of the funds that may be required.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	664	I understand the current level of total deposits in credit unions is between €13 billion and €15 billion.  While the Minister may have a more accurate figure, the sum of money involved is certainly substantial.  Given that most of this money is lent out conservatively because credit unions, unlike banks, have limited powers to lend and must operate differently from the banks, is it appropriate that banks and credit unions should be in a common guarantee scheme?  Given that the savings protection scheme operated by the Irish League of Credit Unions has functioned well thus far, is the Minister implying that he proposes to abandon the scheme or will he produce legislation to maintain or modify it?  Should the credit unions and banks be lumped together permanently in a one-size-fits-all scheme?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	665	The position was that no guarantee was in place and the reason the credit unions were included in the guarantee is that I did not want them to be put at a competitive disadvantage to other financial institutions at the time the €100,000 limit was announced.  I consulted the League of Credit Unions before making that decision.Legislation being drawn up will have to embody the principle that the €100,000 guarantee given by the State can look to a designated fund.  The issue is one of developing a consensus within the credit unions about the appropriate way in which the State can look to any particular fund.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	666	What is the Minister's estimate of the amount held in credit unions?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	667	I do not have a figure to hand but I will arrange for the details to be furnished to the Deputy.  I believe it is of the order of €12 billion.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	668	Discussions are under way with the trustees and administrators of the funded pension schemes of the five older universities and a number of non-commercial semi-State bodies with the aim of adopting a new approach to dealing with the liabilities of these schemes.  The semi-State bodies involved are the IDA, SFADCo, FÁS, Bord Bia, the Irish Goods Council, the Arts Council, CERT and a number of regional tourism organisations.  These university schemes have been closed to new members since 2005 and schemes for post-2005 members operate on a pay-as-one-goes basis.  The discussions follow a recommendation by a working group established by the Higher Education Authority which considered the position of the universities' pension schemes.As the Deputy is aware, all funded schemes must now meet minimum funding standards under EU law unless an appropriate guarantee is provided by the State.  This has presented problems for the universities and non-commercial semi-State bodies with funded pension schemes where the Government is, in effect, responsible for the cost of pensions but where this is not clear enough to warrant exemption under EU law.  It should be noted, however, that the Government is acting in compliance with EU law.The schemes in question have been included, pending the conclusion of the discussions with the trustees or administrators of the schemes in SI 295 of 2008, Occupational Pensions Schemes (Funding Standard) (Amendment) Regulations 2008, and are therefore exempt from the funding standard in the Act.  It is proposed, if the trustees and administrators of the schemes agree, that the assets of the schemes be transferred to the State with the liabilities, which would then be met, effectively, by the State on a pay-as-one-goes basis in future.  The pension terms and conditions of the various schemes would remain the same.  If agreement is reached, legislation to give effect to all this would be required.On the basis of the information available at present, it is estimated that the value of the assets of all of the funds in question at the end of 2007 was approximately €2.3 billion and that, in 2005, the liabilities of the schemes in question were also approximately €2.3 billion.  Clearly, these estimates must be updated.The extent of the liabilities is one of the issues which will be clarified in discussions with the schemes.  The liabilities in relation to these schemes are the defined benefits to which the members are entitled and for which the Government is already in effect responsible.  Under the proposal, these liabilities will be met by the Government on a pay-as-one-goes basis, in line with the approach taken on public service pensions generally.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	669	Why does the Minister have a 2007 valuation on the assets side and a 2005 valuation on the liabilities side?  If the Minister has made a formal proposal to take on these funded schemes without knowing what are their net liabilities, it indicates the Department does not assume liabilities with a great deal of foresight.Is it not bizarre that when the State takes on liabilities of this nature, recognition is not given to the budgeting position?  The €2.3 billion in assets the Government will take in will appear as a reduction in its borrowing requirement, whereas the liabilities it proposes to assume, the value of which will clearly exceed €2.3 billion, will not be accounted for anywhere in the Government's budgeting statements.  Is this not a wake up call to factor pension liabilities into our annual Budget Statement in order that we know what they are and what new liabilities we assume when we employ people or make a decision such as that proposed in this case?  Surely the current position must change.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	670	I assure Deputy Bruton and the House that no agreement has been reached to take over the assets and liabilities in the question.  The provisional character of the figures I provided is provisional and I clearly indicated that the figures will have to be revised.  An agreement has not been finalised and we will have to be in possession of all the facts before any discussions about an agreement can take place.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20325	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	671	The letter issued by the Department is not as qualified as the Minister is trying to make out.

Therefore, an issue would arise in any event as to whether the State bore ultimate responsibility for their pension liabilities.On the question of the taking in of assets and payment of liabilities, a decision that will have to be taken by the Government in the context of the discussions and provided an agreement is concluded is the appropriate destination for any such assets.  An issue will arise as to whether the assets should be vested in the pension fund or whether, as Deputy Bruton suggests, they should be taken into the maw of the general Exchequer balance.On the balance of the liabilities which may accrue on foot of future pension entitlements, I concur that it would be a worthwhile exercise to have a more detailed publication of these in the budgetary exercise.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	673	Does the practice described not sound a little like Enron accounting?  One takes in the assets on one's vehicle, namely, the national accounts, while the liabilities are left hanging out in a little note.  Enron used to do this and it was one of the factors that brought down the company.  Funny accounting, like funny financial products, has had its day.The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, announced this measure as a great coup in a note published around the time the Dáil went into recess in July.  We now learn the Minister is having some thoughts — correctly — about what the exercise entails.  Has he established whether any of the pension schemes involved are in deficit?  Is the Department in negotiations, formal or otherwise, with the trade unions, including the trade unions represented among the pension trustees of the funds in question?  If the Minister decides to proceed with this proposal, will legislation be required and, if so, when will it come before the House?

Furthermore, we need to be in possession of the full facts before we proceed to negotiate any such agreements.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	679	The charge for the provision of the guarantee is based on an assessment of the additional funding costs arising for Government from the guarantee scheme.It is estimated that the total aggregate charge paid by the covered institutions over the next two years will amount to approximately €1 billion.  The thinking behind the charging model is set out in some detail in the annexe to the scheme.The charge will be calculated separately each quarter for each covered institution having regard, inter alia, to the amount of its covered liabilities, a realistic assessment of the risks, the steps taken by the institution to reduce that risk, consistent with the objectives of the scheme, the long-term credit rating of the institution and also any material changes to its risk profile, subject to the estimated cost to the Exchequer being fully recouped.Our intention in framing the charge to be made for the guarantees under the scheme was to protect the taxpayers' interest, while not imposing such charges as would add to the problems we are seeking to solve.  At the same time, it was our intention that financial markets would continue to function normally and that no unfair competitive advantage would be given to the covered institutions.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	680	Did the Minister have an opportunity to read an article in yesterday's Financial Times, which said that Ireland needs high coupon rates to attract investors?  It said Ireland “had to offer 25 basis points, or one-quarter of 1 per cent, over average European government bond yields, which was at the high end of expectations”.  Does the Minister agree Irish bonds are now priced in the same way and only slightly below the highest cost in Europe, which is Greece, and that effectively our bond rates are almost 1% over what they were a year ago when Ireland was one of the best risks?  Ireland has gone from being one of the best risks on bonds to being the second highest, after Greece, within one year. The Minister's scheme valued the cost to the taxpayer of the rise in borrowing costs as being €1 billion over ten years, based on an increased spread of 15 to 30 basis points.  Already, as this week's bond issue shows — he was boasting about it in a reply to an earlier question — it is already 0.25% extra.  It has gone up 54 basis points on the Financial Times bond index, as listed in yesterday’s paper.  The Minister keeps boasting about the scheme.  It has addressed the liquidity, but done nothing to repair the holes in the banks’ capital position or address the impairment of asset values.  When we repay our national loan, it will now cost the Irish taxpayer an enormous extra percentage.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	681	Deputies on all sides of the House will have to be aware that the conditions in the international bond market are not unique to Ireland.  We are not in a unique position in international markets — far from it.  We are operating in a climate where several sovereign states have been unable to access international liquidity in any form whatsoever.  We are also dealing in international markets in which several European states have refrained from seeking to raise funds.  It is in that context that I have pointed out that Ireland had successfully floated a loan.As regards the position of the liquidity guarantee to the banks, which was given in late September, I agree with Deputy Burton that it has served the purpose of providing liquidity to the banks, but it does not address the longer term question of how they are to be restored as viable institutions, extending credit on proper terms to Irish consumers and businesses.

He borrowed, in effect, one third of the Government's borrowing requirement for that scheme.  He is basically giving the banks a free lunch because he is not charging them a price that reflects the extra cost taxpayers will have to pay for the borrowing.  Did the Minister and the Taoiseach not keep saying that this was a type of cost-free scheme?  What plans does the Minister have to recover the extra costs that the poor Irish taxpayer will have to pay?  Is he not concerned, given the trend, that Ireland is now down with Greece as being the second worst country in Europe in terms of risk, having been the best?  Does he believe Ireland will lose its AAA rating in 2009?

The reasons for the increase in the basis points referred to by the Deputy are not related to the guarantee given to the banking system by the Government, but to the general international difficulties, which I have already put on the record of this House——

As regards the question about the protection of the taxpayer, the whole basis of the charging mechanism is to ensure the taxpayer is protected against any increase in the basis points, which are attributable to the giving of the guarantee.

The locations in question are Birr, Cavan, Dungarvan, Edenderry, Thomastown, Thurles and Waterford.  In addition, a site has been purchased at Knock, at a cost of €390,000.Approximately €4 million has been spent to date by the OPW on the costs of renting and fitting out of mainly Civil Service properties in advance party locations where permanent accommodation has been deferred pending a review in 2011.  A further €1.194 million has been expended by FÁS in respect of the advance office at Birr, €856,000 was expended by the Health and Safety Authority in respect of its Kilkenny advance office and approximately €305,000 has been expended by Pobal in respect of its premises at Clifden.  Staff in such locations will remain in place.In addition, I am informed by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, that in parallel with the decentralisation process, Enterprise Ireland strengthened its regional focus in recent years and now has a major presence in the Shannon region in addition to its nine other regional offices.  Certain functions previously carried out by Shannon Development under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland reverted to that agency on 1 January 2007 and, as part of this process, a number of posts from Shannon Development transferred to Enterprise Ireland.  The agency strengthened its regional presence by establishing its new regional development headquarters in Shannon and also houses its county enterprise co-ordination unit there.  Six posts were assigned to the new office in Shannon from Dublin to manage this new regional headquarters.  At present, there are 66 staff working in the Enterprise Ireland's Shannon office.  The annual rent on the regional development headquarters in Shannon is €336,600.  The tendered contract sum for the fit out was €1.43 million, including VAT.The Deputy may wish to know that total income from property disposed of in Dublin between January 2004 and December 2007 was €355.9 million.  In addition, property valued at €75 million was transferred to the affordable homes partnership.  The OPW has also agreed joint venture redevelopment schemes with a minimum value of approximately €125 million up to the end of 2007.Further details of non-property costs expended by location have been sought from relevant Departments.  I will write to the Deputy separately in this regard shortly.

Will he agree the public in the regions were sold a pup by Government in respect of decentralisation and that the reason it has not happened two years after the deadline for its completion is that there was no proper planning of the process from the outset?  Does he not feel some shame in turning up in Cavan where there were to be 244 jobs, or Donegal where there were to be 283, or Waterford where there were to be 431, or Cork where there were to be 840, and explaining that the Government has spent the €27 million, but cannot deliver on those projects because it has been, to put it bluntly, incompetent?

As the Deputy is well aware and as I announced in the budget, the programme is not dead, but in light of our changed economic circumstances, certain matters had to be prioritised.   The Government's latest decision means that 6,000 posts were decentralised outside Dublin.  That is an impressive figure in terms of the decentralisation programme.

The bulk of those were people who were already outside of Dublin who wanted to relocate from one place outside of Dublin to another, for example, someone in Sligo hoping to go to Carrick-on-Shannon to be closer to home.  Will the Minister agree that is where the majority of the decentralisation moves occurred?Has the Minister a figure for the total number of civil servants in outposts, who will not be joined by others for decades?  They will rattle around in large Government buildings and offices with only the ghost of Charlie McCreevy to comfort them.  What does the Minister expect the six civil servants here or the seven civil servants there to do?  They could go mad, left alone in a large building in Carrick-on-Shannon, or someplace like that, with nothing to do.Will the Minister please apologise to taxpayers for the waste by the Government of at least €30 million of taxpayers' hard-earned money?  That money could have been used in those towns for hospitals, teachers and all sorts of facilities.  Instead, it has gone to developers and landlords to rent offices that a few ghost figures in the Civil Service can rattle around in.  Does the Minister intend to visit those people and comfort them occasionally and let them know they are not forgotten and that although they are on their own, somebody somewhere in the bowels of the Department of Finance knows they are still there?  After the war, the Japanese soldiers who wandered in the jungles in Sumatra did not know the war was over.  We have poor civil servants rattling around buildings on their own, not knowing that decentralisation is over.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	713	This issue relates to health insurance, the VHI in particular, but not solely.  At the beginning of the week one of the national newspapers reported there was a plan to increase fees and private health insurance by 62% for the elderly population.  This comes hot on the Government decision to remove medical cards from the over 70s.  I would like some clarity on the situation.The country is well aware that a High Court challenge was made against the Minister's interpretation of risk equalisation.  The Minister lost that challenge and risk equalisation is now out of the equation.  However, the principle of community rating is still with us.  I want to ascertain today what plans or legislation are proposed to allow for community rating to continue.  Failing that, what plans are in train to deal with the situation if private health insurers increase their insurance premia?People are already suffering the shock of the loss of their medical cards.  Over 280,000 people over the age of 60 are insured with the VHI alone.  The proposed increases have huge ramifications for them.  The figure of 62% of an increase is in the media, but from where did this figure come?  Many older people have had their premia paid by their children, as an adjunct to their medical card.  Any increase will hurt them hugely.  With regard to those who left the VHI and who now want to rejoin it, what criteria will be put in place for them?  Will they have to pay the premia for the years they lost?  That would amount to a sum most people could not afford.On top of all this, there has been a rumour circulating that the Government will reduce the tax rebate from the higher rate to the lower rate for medical expenses and that instead of being able to claim back 41% of the VHI insurance premium, people will only be able to claim 20%. Many of the people concerned are just over 60 and many are still working, like many 60 to 69 year olds.  Many of these people also tend to use the public transport system.  These people will also be hit by the €200 per person per car, a sum that before tax is the equivalent of €800 a year.  People are being hit on every side.  They want certainty with regard to their health insurance.I wish to ascertain if the Minister for Health and Children will make a statement on the Supreme Court ruling with regard to the risk equalisation and its implications for health insurers.I want to know the Government's view on reports that health insurance companies are preparing to increase the premium for the older population by up to 60% and its plans to relieve this burden.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.Community rating is a fundamental principle of the health insurance market in Ireland.  Following the liberalisation of the market in 1994, political parties and successive Governments have supported the maintenance of community rating.  It is an inescapable fact supported by international evidence that community rating cannot be sustained without schemes to support the higher costs of claims of older or sicker people, in other words, a risk equalisation mechanism.  There may be differences of opinion on how such a mechanism will work but few dispute its need.A primary objective of Government policy on health insurance is that it should be affordable to the broadest possible cross section of the community, including older people and those who suffer ill-health.  This policy objective has been implemented through a substantial body of primary and secondary legislation providing for open enrolment, community rating and lifetime cover.Although the Supreme Court found our risk equalisation scheme to be ultra vires, it did not strike down the principle of risk equalisation and other important elements of the regulatory framework for private health insurance.  However, the decision gives rise to complex issues which need to be addressed.  The Minister is at present assessing all available options.  Since the judgment was delivered, she has engaged in consultations with officials, the Attorney General and the Health Insurance Authority.  She has also received submissions from insurers.  Complex financial, legal and policy matters are involved, however.It is the Minister's intention to bring forward measures at the earliest opportunity to ensure health insurance remains affordable for older and sicker people.  Deputy Reilly will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the details of such proposals at this time.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	722	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this serious issue.  Inspections of apartment complexes should be made on a regular basis to ensure they meet fire safety standards.At 4.30 a.m. last Saturday, a fire broke out in an apartment block on Main Street, Clongriffin, Dublin 13, in my constituency.  The fire is believed to have been started by mindless thugs who threw bangers into an industrial bin in the apartment's car park.  It is shocking that no fire alarm went off in the apartment complex.  If it was not for the fact that several residents returning home at the time noticed smoke and alerted the other occupants of the complex, the outcome could have been far worse.  The fire brigade encountered difficulties in entering the complex because a code was required to unlock the gate.  It is unacceptable that the fire brigade is not given codes to enter apartment complexes.I have been informed that the complex contains no fire extinguishers or fire fighting equipment and that the fire alarms were not working properly at the time of the fire.  Having visited the location to see the damage first-hand, I can confirm the incident was a near miss.  The outcome could have been tragic and I would be failing in my responsibilities as a Deputy if I did not raise this serious issue.  In the aftermath of the fire, I wrote to the manager of Dublin City Council to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the fire.I call on the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to instruct local authorities to send fire inspectors to apartment complexes on a quarterly basis, at the minimum, to ensure the law is not being breached.  Heavy fines should be imposed on rogue management companies and agents which neglect their duties regarding fire safety.  Inspectors must ensure that all apartment complexes have adequate fire safety procedures in place and that fire drills take place on a regular basis.  Residents of the Clongriffin complex report that they never went through a fire drill in the two years they have lived there.I ask that legislation be drafted to set out the responsibilities of management companies in respect of fire safety.  It should be a legal requirement that apartments cannot be occupied until a fire officer has inspected the premises.  Exactly one year ago, Dublin City Council produced a report entitled Successful Apartment Living.  One of the most damning findings of this report was that 75% of private apartment complexes did not have proper fire safety provisions.  This is a frightening revelation given the number of people who live in apartment complexes.  What action has been taken by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the findings of this report?  Have other local authorities carried out inspections to reassure public representatives that fire safety standards are not being breached?The fire that occurred in Clongriffin is a wake up call to the Government.  Approximately 500,000 people reside in apartments managed by approximately 4,600 management companies in Ireland, yet there is no legislation governing them.  We want the Government to make these companies responsible for fire safety.  The legislation is too loose at present and nobody is taking responsibility for this issue.  I want an assurance that local authorities will take the issue more seriously by assigning sufficient staff so that regular inspections can be conducted.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	723	I thank Deputy Terence Flanagan for raising this matter.  He gave us a timely reminder, as winter approaches, of the need to increase vigilance of fire safety and prevention.The provision of a fire service, including giving advice regarding fire safety, is a matter in the first instance for fire authorities under the Fire Services Act 1981.  My Department's role is one of supporting and assisting fire authorities in delivering fire services through the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme and by setting general policy.  My Department has issued guidance to fire authorities and property owners and occupiers with a view to reducing fire risks in apartments and hostels.  The relevant publications are A Guide to Fire Safety in Flats, Bedsitters and Apartments and Fire Safety in Hostels — A Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Hostels.  In this regard, the 1981 Act provides that it is the duty of every person on a premises to conduct him or herself in such a way as to ensure that, as far as is reasonably practical, no person on the premises is exposed to danger from fire as a consequence of his or her actions.Under the Fire Services Acts, fire authorities can pursue enforcement of fire safety matters, including the management of fire safety.  Fire authorities can serve fire safety notices requiring certain works to be carried out and they also have the ultimate sanction of closing premises.  They are conscious of their functions under the Fire Services Acts.  While they do not require a specific instruction from the Minister in this matter, I agree it is necessary to maintain a constant focus on fire prevention.  Deputies may be aware of the annual fire safety week which was organised by my Department last month.  Television and other media campaigns will continue until the end of the year.  I am sure they also noticed in the media a highly visible campaign entitled "Smoke Kills".  It is critical to get the fire safety message across to the most vulnerable groups.  Unfortunately, on average 46 people die in Ireland each year from fire.  House fires account for the vast majority of fire fatalities.  In most of these incidents, a basic level of fire safety education and awareness may have prevented the fire or limited the consequences.I suggest that the community might assist elderly relatives or neighbours by visiting them regularly to help them carry out a very simple fire safety check on their homes.  Overloaded sockets, candles burning unattended, smoking in bed or smoking while taking medication are potential hazards to watch out for.  Other potential hazards include faulty electric blankets, frayed electrical leads and clothes or combustible materials kept too close to a fire or heater.  If carried out on a regular basis, such checks will help prevent the devastation caused to people and property by fire.It is important to get the correct balance between enforcement, engineering and education in tackling the danger posed by fire and I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I know the House will join me in recognising the commitment of members of the fire service throughout the country.  I commend the service, in particular, on its professional approach in dealing with the challenges posed by increased activity over the recent Hallowe'en period.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	725	The Acting Chairman's pronunciation is excellent as always.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  While I have great respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, I am disappointed that one of the many Ministers of State at the Department of Education and Science could not be present.  I am sure Deputy Kitt will do an adequate job of reading out a reply.I speak on behalf of the people in the community around Leamlara national school.  It is a small community in east Cork that had a public meeting this week.  Oireachtas Members were invited to attend and I gave a commitment to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  The school has an urgent accommodation need.  It is a close-knit, model community but there is a problem with the school.  There are six permanent teachers, four mainstream and two full-time, but there are only three mainstream classrooms.  They must use a general purpose room, which was used for physical education but that can no longer be taught in the entire school.  This is contrary to the Department of Education and Science curriculum guidelines.  There are no toilets in that room and children must go unsupervised down a corridor to go to the toilet.  This is contrary to the board of management safety policy.  There is no water in the general purpose room.The frightening aspect is the amount of building in the area in the past few years.  Just behind the school, a new housing estate was built.  The number of children appearing in the estate has increased by quite an amount.  The current enrolment in junior infants is 11 this year but in a few years' time it will be 25 and is due to grow further.  Already the school is under ferocious pressure.  The school has said that its accommodation needs are current, urgent and merit a significantly higher band rating than 2.4.  I cannot understand why it is rated as 2.4 but the Minister of State might tell me.  Significant goodwill exists locally and the community is willing to provide voluntary skilled labour to build the school if the Department will supply the material.  The school wants a meeting with the Department officials to see what can be worked out.The school representatives are willing to meet the Department more than halfway in order to provide accommodation for the children.  One parent told me that her child looks out the window every day to see if it is fine.  This is the only way they can go out to play or have physical education because the physical education room is gone.  This situation is replicated all over the country but I am here on behalf of these children, parents and this community.  I am anxious that the Minister of State relays this request to the Department of Education and Science and arranges a meeting between officials and the local community and the board of management to see what can be done urgently.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	726	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the proposed building project for Bishop Ahern national school, Leamlara, County Cork.  All applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of the Department of Education and Science.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings and site capacity etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exist but there is a high demand for school places, while a band 4 project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  Each band rating has a number of sub-categories which more specifically describes the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.Bishop Ahern national school is a fully vertical co-educational primary school with a current enrolment of 84 pupils.  The staffing level is a principal, three mainstream assistants and two learning support teachers.  The school authority has applied to the Department of Education and Science for large-scale capital funding for an extension project.Consistent with the approach outlined by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, the application was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects and it has been assigned a band 2.4 rating.  This reflects the fact that, while there is a deficit of accommodation, this does not represent a substantial or significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs.  It also reflects the fact that moderate refurbishment is needed.  The next step for the project is the appointment of a design team.Due to the scale of the demand on the Department of Education and Science's capital budget, it is not possible to provide an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  Earlier this year, the school applied for the provision of temporary accommodation for a mainstream teacher and a resource teacher.  Due to the level of demand on the budget for temporary accommodation, it is not possible to approve all applications received and only those with no scope whatsoever to accommodate extra teaching resources can be approved.In the case of Bishop Ahern national school, it has a 92 sq. m general purpose room.  With a teaching staff of four teachers and an enrolment of 85 pupils, a pupil-teacher ratio of 21:1 will apply.  A smaller classroom than that normally provided by the Department of Education and Science would suffice.  The Department holds the view that part of the general purpose room can be cordoned off for use by the extra mainstream teacher on an interim basis until the Department is in a position to make funding available for an extra classroom.  The school already has a 37 sq. m prefab for its two resource teachers, which is almost the size of what is usually provided and this should be sufficient.  The school has, however, appealed the Department's decision in this matter and this is currently under review.While the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, accepts that it is far from ideal for any children to be taught in non-customised accommodation, he hopes the school authority will realise that the Department does not refuse demonstrably necessary funding applications unless it is not in a position to do otherwise and that, unfortunately, the situation with regard to its temporary accommodation application is unlikely to change this year, particularly given the availability of a short-term solution to the issue within the school itself.The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is €581 million.  This represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme at a time of great pressure on the public finances is a sign of the very real commitment of the Government to investing in school infrastructure.  This is already firmly evidenced, however, by our achievements under the last national development plan when an aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading the existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first level and second level.This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects in addition to investment in site purchases, the annual minor works grant to all primary schools, the asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, emergency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment.  An unprecedented €4.5 billion has been allocated for educational infrastructure under the current national development plan.  This will permit the continuation of the enormous progress we have made in the overall provision and improvement of school accommodation.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	727	I want to raise the need for permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada in Leamhcán or Lucan in the Dublin Mid-West constituency.  As the Minister of State and, I hope, the Minister for Education and Science, should be aware, the school opened and received formal recognition from the Department of Education and Science in 2005.  It is currently located on a site owned by County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  It is operating in prefabs on that site that are rented from the VEC.  That site has been identified as a suitable one for the permanent school building and was surveyed for its suitability to provide a two-stream primary school.  The survey report is with the Department of Education and Science since August 2007.The parents, teachers, pupils and board of management of the school are concerned about the lack of progress since that survey was forwarded to the Department.  From inquiries they have made there have not been any discussions between the Department and the VEC on progressing the development of the site.I reiterate that a site is available for the school, which is located in a rapidly developing area.  Four new primary schools were opened subsequent to the opening of Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada in 2006-07.  Two of those were opened as emergency measures to cope with the demand, three of them have permanent accommodation and one of them operates from temporary accommodation.There is a waiting list for enrolment in Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada up to 2013.  The space available in the school is all nearly used.  The school anticipates that it will not be able to enrol a new intake of pupils in 2010 unless permanent accommodation is provided.  There is not space in the school to  accommodate more pupils.  I visited the school and had a look around the building recently and I can confirm that.  If young people who had hoped to go to that Gaelscoil from 2010 onwards still cannot secure a place there, that will be even more pressure on the Department to open further schools as an emergency measure to cope with increased demand.  If the Department provided permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada, that would help meet the demand for future school places in Lucan.The conditions in the Gaelscoil are not satisfactory for the pupils and teachers.  By September 2009 the school accommodation will be utilised to the maximum.  All the rooms will be used as classrooms and there will no additional rooms available such as an assembly hall or other such rooms.  As the Minister of State will be aware, it is difficult to educate children in prefabs and they are costly to run.  They are inefficient in terms of energy costs.  That is important, given the Government's commitment to provide energy efficient school buildings and the issue of reducing costs through such energy efficiency.There is a lack of support for Gaelscoileanna in the country despite the Government's commitment to support the Irish language.  The patron body of Gaelscoileanna, An Foras Patrunachta, which was established 15 years ago, only got funding of €50,000 from the Department this year while Educate Together, which is the patron body of fewer schools, got funding of €140,000 and the CPSMA also got considerably more funding.  More than half of Gaelscoileanna operate in temporary accommodation.  That has been the case for Gaelscoil na Comóige in Clondalkin for some 14 years or so.The Labour Party has made the case that given our economic circumstances, now is the time to invest in permanent school buildings and build the badly needed primary school buildings such as the one needed for Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada.  That would provide jobs for people who would otherwise be on the dole, which incurs a cost for the State.  Investment in permanent school accommodation is an investment for the future and it is more energy efficient than temporary accommodation.  It is wrong for primary school children to be educated in the conditions to be found in this Gaelscoil.  The primary sector is falling behind in terms of the quality of school accommodation.  I accept the Department has overseen the building of some new primary schools at a much faster pace in recent years.  However, the pupils in many primary schools have been left behind in the Dark Ages in terms of accommodation in a way that second level students have not been.  In a country that supposedly prides itself on how it treats its children, the temporary accommodation provided for them is unacceptable. Money spent on rented prefabs is money wasted while money invested in permanent accommodation is an investment in the future.  The Gaelscoil would like to know the up to date position.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	728	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position in relation to the need for permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada, Lucan, County Dublin.The Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, would like to clarify that modernising facilities in the existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge and one which Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, intends to be one of his priorities as Minister for Education and Science.This Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme to almost €600 million this year.  Within the lifetime of the national development plan almost €4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop on the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.In regard to Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada, the school is currently operating in temporary accommodation on a site that is in the ownership of County Dublin VEC.  The Department is in consultation with County Dublin VEC on the possibility of using this site, together with an additional portion of VEC lands to cater for the school's long-term accommodation needs.  Once the site has been acquired, the building project required to address the school's accommodation needs will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.A study has been conducted to determine the feasibility of this proposal.  It is currently under consideration within the Department and the acquisition of the site will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally.  In light of many competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the acquisition of the school site at this time.Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project which indicates the urgency, type and extent of work required at a school.  The band rating system involves all applications for capital funding being assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting, based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners. This project has a band rating of 1.1.I again thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline the current position in regard to the provision of permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada, Lucan, County Dublin.

This enhanced cooperation facilitates appropriate detailed information exchange, liaison with the Governor and Chief Executive of the Regulatory Authority as well as consultation on specific prudential aspects of the terms and conditions to ensure a consistent approach across all the relevant public bodies by reference to the objectives of the Scheme.The implementation of the Scheme is subject to formal monitoring by the Governor and Chief Executive of the Regulatory Authority and its terms are subject to review from time to time, at no later than six month intervals.  The Regulatory Authority has already advised me that, in light of the severe difficulties faced by credit institutions arising from the crisis of confidence in the global credit market, it will continue to intensify its on-site and off-site supervision of credit institutions.  The scheme also provides that I will report to the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service at six month intervals on the level of the charges received from covered institutions and in relation to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme and progress in relation to the purposes of the Act of 2008.The enhanced cooperation I have outlined is supported by clear obligations on covered institutions to submit reports to the Regulatory Authority in relation to a range of matters including liquidity requirements, capital ratios, asset quality, risk exposures and funding costs, and to provide such other reports as the Regulatory Authority may request at my initiative.  There is also significant provision for the regulation by the Regulatory Authority, in consultation with the Minister, of the commercial conduct of the institutions participating in the Scheme.The Government is satisfied that, alongside the powers provided directly under the scheme, the relevant public bodies and in particular the Regulatory Authority have the authority and legal power to take whatever steps are necessary to continue to look after the interests of all depositors and customers of the covered institutions as well as that of the State and the taxpayer.I am satisfied that the  close coordination and liaison arrangements put in place between the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and my Department will ensure  effective management of the Scheme in an integrated fashion by all of the bodies concerned as well as clear lines of accountability with regard to their respective responsibilities.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	730	As the Deputy will be aware, we have put in place a wide guarantee for the banking system in Ireland.  The legislative scheme setting out the terms and conditions for the guarantee to support the long-term viability of the banking system in Ireland and safeguard the interest of taxpayers has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It has also been approved as being in compliance with the European Commission's requirements and is now in place.To date, the guarantee has been successful in stabilising the position of the banking system in Ireland during an unprecedented period in international financial markets.  The overarching objective of the scheme is to remedy the serious disturbance that might otherwise have unfolded for the economy.  It is about taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we have a banking system that as a whole works effectively, efficiently and competitively in facilitating all the day to day ordinary economic transactions of commercial, business family and social life.The Scheme provides a detailed framework for the authorities to oversee and guide the assessment of strategic options by the banks.  If it is the case that an assessment is made by a particular institution that higher capitalisation would be appropriate, it must consider all possible strategic options to meet this requirement.  Each institution must take appropriate steps to ensure that their levels of capital are aligned with their needs.  The State has a keen interest in the health and security of the banking institutions, because of their role in the economy.  Clearly, my Department, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator will be in continuing contact with the institutions on their business plans, their capital position and their liquidity.As indicated the issue of their capitalisation is a matter for individual banks in the first instance, and I don't think it wise to get into theoretical discussions that might be market sensitive.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	731	As Minister for Finance it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the performance or financial position of an individual credit institution.The Financial Regulator is responsible for the prudential supervision of credit institutions and is therefore best placed to access and analyse information regarding an institution's financial position.  The Financial Regulator has advised the Minister that in light of the severe difficulties faced by credit institutions arising from the crisis of confidence in the global credit market, it will continue to intensify its on-site and off-site supervision of credit institutions.  This will build on revised capital and liquidity measures introduced by the Regulatory Authority during 2006 and 2007.  The Financial Regulator will focus on liquidity requirements, capital adequacy, risk management, balance sheet structure and corporate governance.  This may involve setting additional regulatory ratios as appropriate in order to reduce the risk in the balance sheet, reflecting the current domestic and global conditions.  To augment its own resources the Financial Regulator has engaged an accountancy firm to work intensively to examine the loan books of the six banks that are currently covered by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 and report to the Financial Regulator as a matter of urgency.  This examination will result in a detailed comprehensive analysis of the individual loans in the covered institutions.I would also point out that the Scheme provides that covered institutions are required to submit reports to the Financial Regulator in relation to liquidity requirements, capital ratios, asset quality, risk exposure and funding costs.  The Financial Regulator can request covered institutions to submit such reports as are considered necessary to monitor their compliance with the Scheme.  The implementation of the Scheme is subject to close ongoing monitoring by the Governor of the Central Bank and the Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator.There are also significant powers under the Scheme for the Financial Regulator, in consultation with me, to require action in relation to a covered institution's commercial conduct including setting targets on assets and liabilities and liquidity, solvency and capital ratios, and covered institutions must comply with such targets.  A covered institution can be required to limit is exposure to any sector, customer or connected customer in the interests of financial stability or to take specific actions to restructure its activities in compliance with the Scheme.I am satisfied that there is a comprehensive framework in place to ensure each of the covered institutions actively manages its financial position in accordance with the objectives of the Scheme.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	732	I am keeping the public service paybill under continuous review and I have already taken steps to contain its growth.The draft pay agreement "Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009" provides for a pay pause of 11 months in the public service.  The private sector pay pause provided for is to last for three months.  Furthermore, public service employers are required to achieve a 3% cut in payroll costs in 2009 and no specific additional provision has been made for the cost in 2009 of the increase provided for in the new draft pay agreement.  The cost of this increase must be met from within the approved allocations.Payroll costs are a function of staff numbers.  As I stated in the budget speech, we must do more with less in regard to public service pay and numbers.  Where there are clear staff surpluses in certain areas, or where policy priorities change, staff numbers must be correspondingly reduced or re-assigned.The Government has already decided that a targeted voluntary early retirement scheme will be introduced for the HSE.  Discussions are underway on the development of such a scheme.I believe it is essential to extend such schemes, in a targeted manner, to other areas of the public service where surplus staff are identified.  In this context, the Government has decided to conduct a focused review of public sector numbers in all branches of Government to assess whether the resources are being fully deployed in an efficient and effective manner and what economies can be made.This decision will be implemented when the report of the Task Force on the Public Service is received later this month.Public service pay levels can only increase at a rate that is consistent with budgetary discipline and national competitiveness.  I am satisfied that the measures put in place support this stance.  As I have mentioned, we are keeping public service pay, along with other major expenditure categories, under ongoing review.  Should further corrective action be necessary, this will be taken.

Each covered institution is to submit a report to CIROC no later than six weeks after joining the Scheme, and CIROC will then report to me within three months.  An institution which has not complied with the requirements can be directed to amend its remuneration plan accordingly.It is important to emphasise that one of the key features of this part of the Scheme is the requirement to orient the system of bonuses to create the appropriate incentives — incentives that point toward reduction in excessive risk-taking and that promote long-term sustainability.  I believe that this, together with other controls and requirements incorporated in the Scheme, will make a real difference and greatly strengthen our financial system for the future.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	734	The deterioration in the economy's competitiveness relative to that of our main trading partners has been driven by a combination of factors.  These include a strong euro, the global rise in commodity prices and wage increases in excess of productivity.  The relatively high rate of inflation that we have experienced over the last number of years has also played a role.  At this stage, price levels here are more than 20% above the euro area average.Improving our competitive position is essential to facilitate a re-balancing of the economy towards more sustainable, export-led growth and to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a location for inward investment.In recognition of this, and notwithstanding the need to underpin the sustainability of the public finances, the Government took a number of steps in Budget 2009 aimed at supporting the economy's competitiveness.  These included re-affirming our commitment to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax and maintaining and enhancing pro-employment business tax reliefs.  We are also continuing to prioritise productivity enhancing investment under the National Development Plan.  These measures will ensure that the Irish economy is well placed to take advantage of the global pick-up when it emerges.While my Department, along with the Tánaiste's Department and the National Competitiveness Council all take an active role in monitoring competitiveness developments on an ongoing basis, I would point out that national competitiveness is not, however, solely a matter of Government policy.  Rather it is a shared responsibility of all the Social Partners — Government, employers and unions. Regaining our competitive position, which as a small open economy is critical to our economic success, will require each of us to play our part and work together to this end.This means ensuring that externally-driven price increases do not become embedded in our system as that only creates a vicious cycle from which no one wins. In this respect, the willingness of the various parties to compromise and adopt a realistic approach to wage developments in the recent pay talks is commendable.  In addition, it will be important to ensure that improvements in external factors that impact on domestic costs, such as falling oil prices, are passed on.

Details for each individual institution are available in their published financial statements.I do not have a list of the holders of such debt, which means that I cannot comment as to whether they include directors or substantial shareholders in the institutions covered by the scheme.

In terms of next year, GDP is forecast to decline by ¾ per cent, while GNP is projected to decline by 1 per cent.  The Budget day forecasts have not changed.In preparing these forecasts my Department considered the growth prospects in several of our major trading partners, including the United States and the United Kingdom.  Growth in these countries is slowing and is projected to slow further in 2009.A greater-than-normal level of uncertainty is attached to the economic outlook given the highly unusual prevailing environment.  A number of downside risks to the economic outlook were identified on Budget day including the possibility that the global financial market problems would persist, a more prolonged downturn in our major trading partners, the possibility of further exchange rate appreciation and a sharper than assumed decline in the residential sector.  My Department continues to monitor developments and advises accordingly.

The projected increase arises from the growth in public service employment in recent years and from increasing longevity.  Measures to contain the cost of this increase in public service pensions have been put in place in recent years and policy options for further reform are outlined in the Green Paper on Pensions.  These policy options are now being examined in the context of preparing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the long term.

On the 9th of October, I announced the Government was prepared to extend eligibility for participation in the guarantee Scheme to banking subsidiaries in Ireland with a significant and broadbased footprint in our economy.The terms of the guarantee are set out in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 and individual institutions join the Scheme by executing a guarantee acceptance deed in the form specified by me. The terms of the guarantee Scheme apply to all covered institutions and the form of the guarantee acceptance deed is common to the covered institutions except to the extent that a covered institution has or is a subsidiary and that  each pays an individually determined charge factor based on the  factors set out at paragraph 16 of the Scheme.

The legislation expressly provides to the Financial Regulator the power to enter into a settlement agreement with the parties to resolve such a matter.

In that respect there is continuous liaison with the business community through domestic and overseas channels to monitor any potential changes.In terms of the United States of America, I am not aware of any concrete proposals to make changes to their tax legislation. While there has been some speculation in the context of the Presidential election that any new Administration could seek to make changes to the tax code, it is merely speculation.I do not need to remind the House of the importance of US investment to the Irish economy which has been valued by successive Irish Governments over the last forty years. Irish investment in the US is also of significance. In that context it would be remiss of me not to be mindful of the sensitivity of investment decisions to the overall economic environment that would prevail including the tax environment that could undermine such decisions.

It commits the parties to the Agreement to continued co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives, as well as improved productivity across the Public Service.In approaching the recent Partnership talks the Government recognised that while significant progress has been made in advancing the modernisation agenda, many more changes are needed.  There must be a more customer-focused approach to the delivery of public services and a greater emphasis on efficiency and value for money.  Accordingly, the Agreement recognises that the Public Service must review continuously its systems, processes and procedures to ensure that it is responsive and efficient and that it provides high quality, value for money services.  Specifically, the parties acknowledge the requirement for developing the range of service delivery options, for utilising shared services in areas such as HR, ICT and financial management and for developing cross-organisational solutions as a way of addressing problems of service delivery on a ‘whole of Government' basis.The Government was also mindful of the recommendations of the OECD Review of the Public Service, Towards an Integrated Public Service, which concluded that we are on a sound trajectory of modernisation but could further improve the yield from reforms.  The parties to the Agreement commit themselves to implementation of the basic principles emerging from the OECD report.  The Government has established a Task Force to develop an Action Plan for the Public Service taking account of the recommendations of the OECD Review.  The report of the Task Force will be considered by the Government shortly.

For 2009 the Budget forecast a General Government Balance of -6½% of GDP based on tax revenue growth of 1% and gross voted expenditure growth of 1.8%.Since Budget Day my Department has published the October Exchequer Returns which showed an Exchequer deficit of just over €11 billion for the first ten months of the year, including a tax shortfall of almost €4.3 billion.As I have indicated previously, November is a key month for tax collection. While in the ten months to end-October, the tax shortfall is almost €4.3 billion, my Department expects that a further shortfall of the order of €2¼ billion will materialise in the final two months of the year.While tax receipts in October have continued the poor performance of recent months, they are nonetheless broadly in line with what was anticipated when formulating the end year estimated outturn that underpinned the Budget. In overall terms, the assumed shortfall for the year is approximately €6½ billion and this has not been revised in light of the October tax data.Budget 2009 forecast tax receipts of almost €42.8 billion in 2009, which represents revenue growth of approximately 1% as a result of significant revenue raising measures introduced in the Budget.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The Deputy will appreciate that recent media attention to court proceedings for repossessions needs to be interpreted with caution, given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases. Although the number of cases involving applications for possession orders are up in each of the last two years it should be noted that orders are not always granted and do not always represent residential mortgages. Even when orders are granted they are not always followed through and levels remain low compared to historical averages and in comparison to similar jurisdictions such as the UK. In 2007, the number of orders granted by the High Court was a very small proportion — representing less than 0.2% — of the number of new mortgages issued in the same year. Furthermore, cases currently being heard are not confined to one particular year or time period.Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems. Anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying a mortgage or other loan should discuss the matter with the loan provider and seek appropriate advice without delay. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt.  MABS offices, throughout the country, work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future. Funding for MABS in 2009 is €17.9 million. The Department of Social and Family Affairs also funds the demand-led Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme which provides short-term income support to those eligible who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  Support for this scheme was increased in the recent budget.Non-financial supports in place include the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code (the CPC), which applies to all home loan providers operating in the State, requires mortgage lenders to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers and requires that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears irrespective of the amount of the arrears. It also specifies that the regulated entity must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears and the Financial Regulator's CEO has pointed out that the Financial Regulator considers this to include a requirement that lenders agree a remedial action plan with a borrower as soon as it detects arrears starting to emerge and to try to assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen. (For details see www.financialregulator.ie).The Deputy may wish to note that the provisions of the Scheme made under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act, 2008, requires institutions covered by the guarantee in Ireland to confirm their compliance not only with the CPC but also with the Irish Banking Federation's (IBF) Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears (the  IBF's Code).In accordance with the IBF's Code borrowers are advised to contact their lender about any problems they may be experiencing regarding meeting their repayments schedule. It recommends that the borrower contact the lender after one missed scheduled payment (again irrespective of the amount) in order to prevent a situation of mounting arrears arising with negative consequences for both the borrower and lender.Once the borrower has contacted the lender, the latter will consider all viable options and develop a plan for clearing the mortgage arrears. Home repossession should be the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention. In the light of all of the above I am satisfied that adequate safeguards are in place to address the issues raised by the Deputy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	744	Within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  This follows from its role as part of the European System of Central Banks and its functions, as the Financial Regulator, in relation to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.The Central Bank publishes a quarterly note on the sectoral developments in credit. In June 2008, outstanding private-sector credit stood at €392.9 billion.   While property-related lending accounted for 62 per cent of this, this measure includes residential mortgages, and securitised residential mortgages.   During 2006 when all credit was increasing at a rapid pace, lending to households was also increasing rapidly.   This has moderated slowly since then and increased annually by 9 per cent in June 2008. I am informed by the Central Bank that lending to insurance corporations and pension funds only account for a small proportion of private sector credit, around 1 per cent.It is worth noting that lending to households for house purchase is continuing despite tighter lending standards, albeit at a slower, steadier pace than before. I also note from the latest EBS/DKM Affordability Index published on 4th November that affordability for first time buyers continues to improve and that this trend is set to continue over the coming months.Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems. Anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying a mortgage or other loan should discuss the matter with the loan provider and seek appropriate advice without delay. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, works with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future.

The Deputy may wish to note that the provisions of the Scheme made under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act, 2008, requires institutions covered by the guarantee in Ireland to confirm their compliance not only with the CPC but also with the IBF's Code of Practice.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	745	Following a decision by the Government on the implementation of recommendations in Report No. 38 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, schemes of performance-related awards were introduced for the levels of Deputy Secretary and Assistant Secretary in the civil service, the Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner ranks in the Garda Síochána and the ranks of Brigadier General and Major General in the Defence Forces.The schemes of awards are based on performance by reference to demanding targets. The pool for performance awards is 10% of the pay bill for the group concerned. Within that overall limit individuals can receive payments of up to 20% of pay (although payments at that level would be very rare).I have no role in the decisions on awards. Recommendations for awards under the scheme are made, in the first instance, by the relevant Secretary General or other designated post as appropriate. These recommendations are then submitted to an independent body, the Committee for Performance Awards (CPA), which includes a majority of private sector members.  The main roles of the Committee are to monitor the application of the scheme of performance-related awards and to bring independent judgement to bear in approving objectives for the persons covered by the scheme and in approving recommendations for awards.Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the schemes, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the Committee (available on the website www.finance.gov.ie.) The annual reports provide a commentary on how the schemes have operated each year and the CPA make suggestions about how aspects of the scheme can be improved.I am satisfied that the CPA is fulfilling its remit in relation to the schemes. There are separate schemes of performance-related awards for senior staff of local authorities and the health service. The Committee for Performance Awards in the Local Authority sector deals with the assessment of performance for senior managers in local authorities. For senior managers in the health service, the board of the HSE/relevant agency makes awards based on the agreed criteria. The scheme is quality assured by an Oversight Committee which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children.Schemes of performance-related pay may also apply to the Chief Executive Officers of non-commercial State sponsored bodies (and in some cases, to the second tier of management). The Review Body considered that certain conditions should be in place in non-commercial State-sponsored bodies before schemes of performance-related awards were introduced. Where a Board considers that these conditions can be met, the Board of the body concerned may submit a draft scheme to the relevant parent Department. If the parent Department is also of the view that the necessary conditions can be met, it submits the draft scheme to my Department for approval. Once schemes have been approved, the Department of Finance does not have any role in the awards made by the Boards of the bodies concerned. These schemes are also based on the achievement of stretched targets and provide for a maximum bonus of 20% of pay. The guidelines provide that awards of between 15% and 20% should arise only in the most exceptional situations where performance has surpassed all reasonable expectations and has resulted in the achievement of a major goal of the body. Decisions on the level of payment to be awarded are the responsibility of the Board of the body concerned.I have no plans at present to introduce schemes of performance-related awards for other public service staff.

The banks will be releasing accounts and information over the coming months.  The Financial Regulator clearly takes a direct interest in this issue, with a view to ensuring financial stability.  I understand that the Regulator is engaged in an exercise at present to review the loan books and business plans of the guaranteed institutions.As regards the capital position of the banks, each institution must take appropriate steps to ensure that their levels of capital are aligned with their needs.  The State has a keen interest in the stability of the banking institutions, because of their role in the economy.  Clearly, my Department, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator will be in continuing contact with the institutions on their business plans, their capital position and their liquidity. Under the guarantee scheme, institutions can be required to adjust their capital ratios if that is required for the maintenance of financial stability.

An important aim of the Scheme of Guarantees we have introduced is to ensure that we have a banking system that as a whole works effectively, efficiently and competitively in facilitating all the day-to-day ordinary economic transactions of commercial, business, family and social life. The scheme therefore includes the application of strict terms and conditions on covered institutions to ensure that the public interest, which includes the general consumer and small business sector, is paramount.By putting guarantees in place we have removed a major obstacle to financial institutions continuing to play their proper role in facilitating enterprises and individuals with credit.

While in the ten months to end-October, the tax shortfall is almost €4.3 billion, my Department expects that a further shortfall of the order of €2¼ billion will materialise in the final two months of the year.While tax receipts in October have continued the poor performance of recent months, they are nonetheless broadly in line with what was anticipated by my Department, when formulating the end year estimated outturn that underpinned the Budget. In overall terms, the assumed shortfall for the year is approximately €6½ billion and this has not been revised in light of the October tax data.Budget 2009 forecast tax receipts of almost €42.8 billion in 2009, which represents revenue growth of approximately 1% as a result of significant revenue raising measures introduced in the Budget.

The Evaluation Unit in my Department reviews these spot-check reports and may also directly undertake its own spot checks of individual capital projects either as part of this review process or on its own initiative.In this context, The Evaluation Unit has also undertaken a substantial programme of direct spot checks of individual capital projects encompassing over 20 projects across six different Departments — Transport; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Education and Science; Health and Children; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Arts, Sport and Tourism.On completion a final report on each spot-check is submitted to the relevant Department.  As may be expected, these reports can raise issues from time to time and as a result do provide advice to Departments on aspects such as the planning, appraisal and execution of specific projects by reference to the VFM framework in place, which Departments are expected to consider and action as appropriate.

The Government took the decision to safeguard all deposits of those credit institutions wishing to participate in the scheme following advice received from the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator as to the impact of the turmoil in the international financial markets on the Irish banking system.I should say that the objective of the guarantee is to provide confidence amongst senior investors in the wholesale capital markets.  In recent years, as a result of tightening credit spreads, traditional investors in senior unsecured debt have increased their exposure to non-deferrable dated subordinated debt ("Lower Tier 2") in search of additional yield.  Today, the overlap in the investor base for both senior and Lower Tier 2 is extremely high. Therefore, we feel it is important to the success of the guarantee to include dated subordinated liabilities in order to preserve capital market access for the Irish institutions going forward.

The Deputy will appreciate that this review is highly commercially sensitive and accordingly the Financial Regulator will not be publishing the results of the PwC work.

The FOI Act enables members of the public to obtain access to information held by public bodies,  to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy. Currently a member of the public can seek access to any record held by a public body covered by the Act, including information held by Government Departments relating to the Public Capital Programme.  However, there are exemptions set out in the Act that protect certain types of records that would contain, for example, commercially sensitive information and where the public interest would not be served by the release of such information.In relation to projects in the Public Capital Programme, Cost-Benefit appraisals of these projects are prepared by the individual Departments and Agencies undertaking the projects.  Such appraisals are prepared to facilitate and inform the internal decision making process.  It has not been the practice to publish these appraisals as they generally contain commercially sensitive information, the publication of which could be prejudicial to the State's capacity to get best value for money in procurement of capital projects. In these circumstances, I would not consider it appropriate to require that details of such appraisals be published or made available under the FOI Act.

This account will act as a reserve for any payment that may be made under the scheme.  The scheme further provides that any amount standing to the credit of such an account at the expiration of the scheme will be paid to the Exchequer.The current estimate of the income from the scheme over the two years is €1 billion.  However, the level of income that will actually arise will depend on factors such as the institutions covered by the scheme, the level of covered liabilities and the charge applied to individual institutions.  The scheme provides for the payment of the charge on a quarterly basis by each covered institution.

In the immediate wake of its introduction, I have been informed that the level of deposits received by the covered institutions have largely reversed the liquidity losses in previous weeks with total net inflows of around €25 billion to date.  Subject to the rules of the scheme, any net increase in the level of deposits by the covered institutions will also increase the level of liabilities under the scheme.  The scheme requires that balance sheet growth of the covered institution is not excessive.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator will be in continuing contact with the covered institutions in relation to their levels of liabilities and liquidity.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	757	In my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. The day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Financial Regulator, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions. The Financial Regulator is also obliged to treat as confidential the information it holds on regulated entities.  However, he has advised me that on the basis of the latest figures available, all insurers meet the statutory solvency margin requirements. He has also advised me that monthly monitoring of solvency positions will take place where necessary.It should be noted that the Financial Regulator approaches prudential regulation from a risk perspective and tries to target its supervisory resources on those businesses with a higher risk profile and with the propensity to have the greatest impact in the event of a failure. This approach dovetails with the broader financial stability agenda in which my Department, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator work closely. This agenda takes account, on an ongoing basis, of the general financial well being of the insurance industry and provides the basis for an appropriate response to changing circumstances and developments.

It is a matter for each Department to manage its capital allocation to maximise impact and value for money. The Value for Money Framework put in place by Government over recent years will help ensure that value for money is attained and that public capital investment is delivered on time and within budget.In the current economic climate, capital expenditure will be prioritised towards critical infrastructure projects.  As you are aware, resources are allocated, inter alia, towards major inter-urban motorways, public transport, water services infrastructure, education, social housing and health infrastructure.

I wish to refer the Deputy to the statement by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. John Hurley, issued on 3rd October 2008, which makes it clear that the Government's decision to guarantee depositors in and lenders to Irish financial institutions was taken after close consultation with the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, and sets out the context. The Statement is available on the Central Bank Website at the following address www.centralbank.ie.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	760	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.As the Deputy is aware, the day-to-day management of the debt is handled by the National Treasury Management Agency and as such it is on their advice that Government relies in relation to the operation of our debt funding.The cost of raising long-term debt in the capital markets can be measured in relative terms to other countries. This is known as the ‘spread'. In the case of Ireland, its cost of borrowing can be measured against the relative borrowing costs of, for example, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal or Greece. The spread to Germany is the benchmark measure and it is observed by comparing the yields on bonds of similar maturity.Since September 2008 the turbulence in financial markets has been severe and this has been reflected in bond spreads. Only time and a historical perspective will allow a true analysis of the causes and, more importantly, the relative weight that should be ascribed to the different factors.  As international difficulties have evolved over the past few months, all small and non-core sovereign issuers, such as Ireland, have experienced widening spreads. Liquidity has been a major factor. Most investors have focused on German Government debt as it is considered the most liquid investment — this means German bonds can be readily accessed and traded, and also that there is a liquid futures market in German government bonds to manage the associated market risks. However, while spreads have widened against Germany, absolute yields have remained low or even decreased, depending on the timeframe, because of the extent to which German yields have fallen.Ireland's economic success in the past has resulted in a relatively low debt to GDP ratio and also a low absolute level of debt. We have not been a frequent issuer of bonds which reflects both the relative size of the Irish economy and the healthy state of the public finances for the last decade. These positive factors have in fact had the effect of contributing to liquidity difficulties for Ireland in the current market.There are a number of other factors in addition to liquidity which influence borrowing costs. These include the state of the public finances, the level of borrowing requirement, and competition for funding in the sovereign debt markets. It is not possible to say to what extent each of these factors will affect the spread in the future.The following per cent yields on Ireland's 10 year bonds were observed in the secondary market since September 2008:1-Sep29-Sep1-Oct3 -NovIreland4.4934.4924.5814.771All of the factors detailed above have been absorbed into the pricing of insuring Irish Government bonds against default.  At time of writing this works out at €11,370 for 10 years per million insured. This was approximately €6,650 at the beginning of October and €3,710 at the beginning of September 2008.  However, the credit default swaps (CDS) market is neither liquid nor transparent and, as a result, prices quoted are volatile. CDS spreads are a cost to the investor — they do not directly affect the cost of debt to the Exchequer.Despite the difficult and volatile market conditions since September, the NTMA has continued to be successful in raising finance for the Exchequer.  Over €2.5 billion in short term funding was raised in October and this week the NTMA issued a new €4 billion three-year benchmark bond.  The bond was oversubscribed within 36 hours and close to 100 applicants participated in the transaction. The successful launch of the bond in these conditions confirms the confidence of investors in the Irish Government bond market.Finally, the strategy underpinning Budget 2009 is designed with the clear intention of restoring balance to the public finances over the medium term cycle while having reference to the overall economic climate. In doing so the Government seeks to restore the current Budget to surplus and to limit the level of borrowing required as order and stability return to the Exchequer finances.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	761	The Deputy is referring to the proposal by the Commission in the draft Capital Requirements Directive amending Directive, which is currently going through the co-decision legislative process, for improving the risk management for securitised products and addressing significant weaknesses in the so-called "originate-to-distribute" model which has played a central role in propagating the sub-prime crisis in the USA to the financial sector internationally.Basically, it is proposed that firms that repackage loans will be required to retain some risk exposure to these securities, while firms that invest in such securities will be allowed to make their decisions only after conducting comprehensive due diligence.For instance, banks issuing securitisations would be required to retain not less than 5% of the net economic interest in an issue. Similarly, banks would be prohibited from investing in securitisations unless the originator retained at least 5% of the risk.Securitisation has been a useful means of meeting the funding needs of the banking sector.  Accordingly, my Department is in consultation with industry representatives regarding the possible implications of the Commission's proposal for securitisation activities in Ireland and these contacts are ongoing. Moreover, compromise proposals on the draft Directive, including in relation to the securitisation elements, are currently under consideration in the Council Working Group. In the circumstances, my Department has not yet taken a definitive stance in regard to the so-called 5% retention proposal but it will be a priority to ensure that the agreed approach supports the maintenance of financial stability and the appropriate pricing of risk.

Implementation of each proposal is primarily a matter for the responsible Department.The rationalisation of State agencies, which involves amalgamating bodies, reassigning legislative and administrative functions, and discontinuing bodies in some cases, is a complex and sensitive exercise.  Furthermore, rationalisation will give rise to a range of human resource issues, which will be the subject of consultation and discussion with the relevant staff interests as appropriate.Consequently, in view of the complexities outlined above and timing issues, it is not yet possible to give an exact overview of the rationalisation process but there will be savings which will be passed on to the taxpayer.

The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate.

The scheme also includes the principle that any payment not recovered from the institution concerned will be recouped from the sector as a whole over time in a manner consistent with the institutions long term viability and sustainability.  If such a situation were to arise that there was a need to recoup from the sector as a whole, it would be a matter for Government to decide how best to proceed.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	767	In Budget 2009, I announced a significant reduction in the annual earnings limit for tax relieved pension contributions from just over €275,000 to €150,000. This reduced limit will apply for 2009 to all individuals contributing to private pension arrangements. The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits, to determine the value of pension contributions on which an individual taxpayer will get tax relief at his/her marginal income tax rate in any year.The reduction in the annual earnings cap to €150,000 next year will result in a significant fall in the maximum value of tax relief that high earners can obtain on contributions to private pension provision. This change was made to promote greater equity in this area.Apart from the annual limits on the amount of tax relieved contributions that can be made to pension funds, the maximum allowable pension fund that an individual can draw upon in their lifetime from tax relieved pension arrangements, known as the standard fund threshold, also acts to restrict the build-up of tax relieved pension benefits. In that regard, in a further policy change introduced in Budget 2009, the indexation of the standard fund threshold in line with an earnings index will not be undertaken in 2009. This will reduce the ability of higher earners to grow their pension funds through tax-relieved pension contributions.

It would be utterly wrong to interpret the points set out in that opinion as a threat to withdraw funds from Irish banks.  No such threat was ever received.The simple reality is that the tone of our engagements with the European authorities — both the Commission and the ECB — has been very positive and constructive throughout this process. The Deputy will be aware that the Scheme has been approved by the European authorities.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	772	Revenue's Customs Service has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation. This Service has particular responsibility for implementing import and export controls at all points of entry/exit to/from Ireland, including ports, airports and the land frontier with Northern Ireland.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in line with best practice in customs administration worldwide, the development of information and intelligence is critical to the successful detection of drug smuggling. This is very important in the case of Ireland and other EU Member States where the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti smuggling checks.  The approach has, of necessity, been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling, especially drug smuggling.I am satisfied that Revenue attaches significant importance to its role in drug enforcement and that Customs staff are keenly aware of their drug prevention role. At corporate level, Revenue's Statement of Strategy 2008-2010, which was launched in February 2008, contains a clear commitment on Revenue's role in the war against drugs.  In addition, Revenue is contributing at Interdepartmental Group level to the formulation of the Government's new National Drug Strategy 2009-2016.A further indication of Revenue's commitment in this area has been the development of specific Revenue Strategic and Operational Plans for Drug Interdiction for the period from 2008-2010. The development of these two plans, together with the recent decision by Revenue to invest further significant resources in this area (such as the purchase of a second Customs Cutter and the expansion of the detector dog programme) is testimony to the fact that this is an area of long-term strategic interest to Revenue and confirms its commitment to delivery in tackling the drugs problem.At operational level, Revenue is fully committed to providing an effective level of protection against drug smuggling at frontiers by systematically applying controls commensurate with the levels of risk identified.  All operations are risk focussed and resources are deployed to combat areas of greatest risk. In this regard, Revenue is continuously engaged in analysis and evaluation of seizure trends, routes and smuggling risks and in consequential resource deployment.In developing information and intelligence, Revenue works very closely with the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Coast Guard Service. In addition, especially in view of the international dimension to drug trafficking, Revenue also attaches importance to optimising cooperation, collaboration and intelligence sharing with authorities in other countries. An example of its commitment in this area has been the recent assignment of Revenue officials as liaison officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague and at the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre — Narcotics in Lisbon, jointly established by Ireland and six other EU partner states. The Centre is already playing an important role in collating intelligence and co-ordinating a better international law enforcement response to the trafficking of cocaine into Europe.In addition to co-operation with other enforcement agencies, Revenue also recognises the importance of co-operation with business interests and the community generally in the fight against drug smuggling. In this regard, every effort is made to maintain good relationships with trade and the community in order to optimise cooperation, collaboration and intelligence sharing. Revenue already has a Memorandum of Understanding programme in place with businesses to encourage them to join the fight against drug smuggling. Revenue also has a Customs Drugs Watch programme in place that facilitates confidential reporting by the members of the community (particularly those living along the coast and those that are living close to airports and sea ports) of any suspicious activity.One measure of Revenue's success in the war against drug smuggling has been the value of drugs seized in the five years, 2003 to 2007, during which a total of 7,770 drug seizures were made with an estimated street value of €219m. In the period January 2008 to date, a further 5,200 drug seizures have been made with an estimated street value of €39m. (The figures from 2003 to date include some seizures made during joint operations with the Gardaí. The significant increase in the numbers of drug seizures in 2008 to date is due to an increase in the detection of medicines and also an increase in the number of drug seizures in the post).Revenue's Customs Service also has responsibility for policing the controls regulating the importation and exportation of cash and they have had some notable successes. While these controls are aimed at criminality generally, there is little doubt that much of the cash seized originates from the drugs trade so it is clear that these activities by Customs are also contributing to the war against drugs.Finally, I have been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied that the current risk based approach, which is in line with international best practice in this area, is the correct approach to follow.

This Government moved swiftly to put in place a guarantee to ensure Irish financial institutions' access to the normal liquidity and funding for their day to day business, and to give confidence to depositors and wholesale lenders.   The Government quickly demonstrated its resolve to support the financial system, in order to support the economy and society, enterprises and families.In tandem with the guarantee, the intensified scrutiny and oversight of financial institutions which was put in place since the onset of the turmoil in financial markets has been maintained and further strengthened to ensure that high standards of regulation are achieved in Ireland and that the quality of corporate Governance applying in all institutions, including lending practices, the safeguard of  the interests of taxpayers.  The goal at the end of this process is a banking system that is "fit for purpose" for the transformed financial environment in which it will find itself operating in the coming decades.An integral part of ongoing regulation is a detailed and ongoing assessment and analysis of the capital adequacy and solvency of all credit institutions within the state to ensure the stability of the system and flow of credit. Further, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Legislation, provides a detailed framework for the authorities to oversee and guide the assessment of strategic options by the banks themselves. The Irish scheme is firmly aligned with the main themes of the euro group plan, which contains an option to provide additional capital resources where appropriate to the banks. Each institution must take appropriate steps to ensure that their levels of capital are aligned with their needs.  The State has a keen interest in the health and security of the banking institutions, because of their role in the economy.  Clearly, my Department, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator will be in continuing contact with the institutions on their business plans, capital position and their liquidity.

In the process of establishing the scheme, there has been regular contact between my officials and a wide range of financial institutions, including the company referred to by the Deputy.The company referred to has chosen, for its own reasons, not to join the scheme and my Department was informed of this decision by letter dated 28 October 2008.  The company has publically stated that this decision was influenced by the fact that its parent company has joined the UK Government Capital Guarantee Scheme and it did not see a need to participate in two schemes.

It is also proposed to exempt those on low incomes from the income levy. Full details on the levy will be set out in the forthcoming Finance Bill.In relation to information requested by the Deputy, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the numbers of income earners in the ranges of income specified are as provided in the following table. The numbers of earners are based on the adjusted data for 2005 projected forward to 2009 terms in accordance with macroeconomic data relating to actual and expected growth in wages and employment.Range of Gross incomePAYESelf-EmployedTotal100,001- 200,000Single14,2004,80019,000Married two earning78,20014,90093,200Married one earning18,0004,40022,400Widowed7006001,400Range Total111,10024,700135,900over 200,000Single2,0002,7004,800Married two earning10,2009,00019,200Married one earning4,5003,8008,300Widowed200300500Range Total16,90015,80032,800Any apparent discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.It should be noted that the income ranges shown in the above table relate to gross income as defined in Revenue Statistical Report, 2006.  They do not include incomes such as income from patent royalties, profits from commercial forestry, income before pension contributions and income from earnings of writers, composers and artists that will be subject to the income levy but are not currently available in the range basis breakdown as requested by the Deputy.It should also be noted that gross income is different to taxable income, also defined in the Revenue Statistics Report 2006, which relates to income after personal reliefs and deductions (including deductions for capital allowances) but prior to the application of tax credits and reliefs at the standard rate.A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.The figures are projected estimates rounded to the nearest hundred and may be subject to further revision.

The charge for the provision of the guarantee is derived from the Government funding cost.While it would be possible in theory to estimate a market value for the guarantee, such an estimate would be based on a number of important assumptions.  In practice, there is no market providing the type of guarantee scheme which we have introduced and it is doubtful if any market price estimate could be made reliably or accurately.

I visited the area in September and met with the President of the Irish Farmers' Association and a number of farmers, and saw conditions at first hand.  The Deputy will be aware that the rainfall this summer was exceptional, and exacerbated what is an already difficult situation in the Callows, due to the extremely flat gradient of the river, which makes it very difficult to devise a cost-effective solution.The Office of Public Works has carried out some clearance of vegetation in the area, and the farmers acknowledge that, while that was not sufficient to prevent the flooding this year, it has improved the situation.There is a proposal to remove silt from the Shannon Cut to try further to improve the situation.  While OPW has some reservations as to how effective this will be, it is prepared to undertake a pilot project to test the efficacy of the measure, provided it is possible to do so in a cost-effective manner.  Some discussions have taken place with the National Parks and Wildlife Service regarding the granting of a licence for this work.  A number of issues have arisen, and OPW is in the process of arranging a meeting with NPWS, the IFA and other stakeholders to discuss the matter.  The meeting will be held as soon as possible, and further progress will depend on the outcome.

It thus provides an accurate assessment of the fiscal performance of a more complete "government" sector.  The GGB does not reflect the position of commercial State sponsored bodies as these agencies are classified as being outside the General Government Sector.We have been keeping the European Commission informed about economic and fiscal developments in Ireland and I briefed Commissioner Almunia on the emerging situation in September.  I have also provided my colleagues at Eurogroup and ECOFIN with an outline of the evolving budgetary position.  The European Commission's autumn Economic Forecast published on 3 November indicates that a number of countries are expected to breach the 3% reference value over the next three years.  The Commission has indicated that it now proposes to initiate an Excessive Deficit Procedure for Ireland in the light of the projected general government deficit of 5.5% of GDP for 2008.  This is the norm for countries exceeding the 3% reference value and it begins a process that will lead to consideration by the Commission and the Ecofin Council of the position in the coming months.  As part of that process there have also been exchanges with the Commission at official level in relation to the factors which might be considered relevant in their consideration of the Irish situation.

The Budget sets out a medium-term strategy with the clear intention of stabilising and restoring balance to the public finances as soon as possible by, amongst other things, reducing and prioritising public expenditure and adjusting taxation levels to reflect the changed realities.There have been no changes to the aggregate Budget forecasts.  In relation to spending gross voted expenditure is set at just over €64 billion for 2009.  Taxation measures in 2009 are expected to raise almost €42.8 billion.  With regard to adjustments to taxation and expenditure measures, I have stated my commitment to remaining within the budget parameters.  Government Departments are required to manage within their agreed spending allocations as set out in the Budget.

In addition, I am kept closely in touch with developments through ongoing dialogue at official level.I do not believe it would be helpful to discuss individual meetings or correspondence.  I am sure that the Deputy will recognise the strong potential for misinterpretation and misinformation in the market if I were to publicly discuss each individual meeting that I have held.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	783	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 101 together.In my Budget speech, I announced that the current single payment date for preliminary corporation tax for large companies (those whose corporation tax liability in their previous accounting period is more than €200,000) will be split into two instalments.  This will apply to accounting periods commencing on or after Budget Day, 14 October 2008.  The details of how the new arrangements will work are set out in the Summary of Budget Measures which forms part of the published Budget 2009 documentation.The change to the preliminary tax payment dates will give rise to an estimated once-off cash flow gain to the Exchequer of €350 million in 2009.  The change involving the bringing forward of the payment date in 2009 for individuals paying capital gains tax will generate a further €200 million in 2009 on a once-off basis.  The rationale for these changes is the need to stabilise the public finances and all sections of the economy and community have to play their part in addressing the fiscal challenges we are facing.As regards additional administration burdens on business, it should be noted that well over 90% of companies, that is small companies with a corporation tax liability of €200,000 or less in their previous accounting period will not be affected by the changes to the payment dates for preliminary corporation tax.  Moreover, despite the need to secure substantial increases in tax revenue, the Budget was carefully structured so as not to worsen the competitive position of Irish business and to include measures to support jobs, encourage enterprise and enhance our productive capacity. These additional measures include: an increase in the rate of R&D tax credit from 20% to 25%, a remission of corporation tax and capital gains tax for new start up companies in their first three years of trading where their tax liability in any year does not exceed €40,000, and an extension of the deadlines for the online submission by businesses of tax returns and payments.I should also make the point that the Revenue Commissioners have in recent years introduced many simplification measures designed to ease the compliance burden for business.  The measures have involved legislative, administrative, operational and e-business aspects.  A comprehensive programme to systematically consolidate and streamline the body of older legislation governing the various taxes and duties has made significant progress in streamlining and simplifying the regulatory environment for business.  Less frequent filing obligations and increased registration thresholds introduced in recent years have reduced the administrative burden for thousands of small businesses.  The development of the Revenue On-Line System (ROS) has also been acknowledged as a major contributor to the reduction of the administrative burden on business.Reducing the administrative burden on business has been and continues to be a key priority for Revenue and their efforts in this area have been acknowledged by business representatives.

Section 6(4) provides that the provision of financial support may be effected by individual agreement, a scheme made by the Minister or otherwise.  To date the only financial support that has been provided under the Act had been provided under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 (SI no 411 of 2008).  No financial support has been provided under an individual agreement.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	786	Last year, my Department's Budget 2008 forecast assumed tax revenue growth of 3½% for 2008.  This was viewed as a conservative forecast by many commentators and in fact others, such as the ESRI, forecast stronger revenue growth at the time.  However, tax revenue weakened considerably as the year progressed, reflecting the challenging domestic and international economic environment.  Consequently, the Department of Finance expects an end-year tax shortfall of the order of €6½ billion.  As part of Budget 2009, my Department forecast tax revenue growth of approximately 1% in 2009 as a result of significant revenue raising measures introduced in the Budget.Earlier this year, the Department of Finance published a report produced by a group specifically established to examine the tax forecasting methodologies used by the Department.  The Tax Forecasting Methodology Review Group comprised of experts from the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank and had input from the EU Commission.In terms of the findings, while the Group suggested that the Department of Finance displays a prudent bias in tax forecasting, it did not suggest any major structural recommendations to the way the Department forecasts tax revenue.  However, it did suggest a number of adjustments which the Department is currently implementing.  Furthermore, the Group's report also indicated that the Department's methods were not out of line internationally.  A copy of the Group's report is available on the Department of Finance website at www.finance.gov.ie.

At that stage, the Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation.  However, it would be fair to say that most EU Finance Ministers at that time had reservations about the Tobin tax proposal.  In particular, it was believed that it was not clear whether a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure satisfactory answers to issues relating to the tax, including: difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other (non-taxable) alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.Nevertheless, at a formal Ecofin meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for, and against, a Tobin tax.  This study, "Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation", was published on 14 February 2002.  On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that "while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated".This issue was also raised at EU level in 2005 in the context of the financing of development aid but was dismissed by the EU Commission for reasons such as those already outlined.I do not propose to introduce such a tax as I am unconvinced of its feasibility given the many practical difficulties and potentially negative implications arising from its introduction.

Clear notification procedures are in place and all sick leave is monitored for compliance with sick leave regulations.  For this purpose, sick leave is measured in "duration days" (span of sickness absence from date of first absence to date of return to work) rather than actual working days lost.  Separately, my Department has begun detailed examination of sickness absence, applying international best practice principles.  Our first such examination was done in respect of the calendar year 2007.  According to this analysis, the percentage of working days lost due to sickness absence was 3.90% in 2007 and 4.02% in 2006.  Currently, my Department does not cost the impact of absences.

No. 60 of 2007), which transpose the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) into national law. This would be on the basis that what is concerned in the Deputy's question is a ‘derivative instrument for the transfer of credit risk' within the meaning of that legislation. In such a case, subject to certain exceptions provided for in the Regulations, an Irish firm providing those services would require to be authorised by the Financial Regulator and its compliance with the Regulations and related capital requirements would be supervised by the Financial Regulator. The position is the same for other derivative instruments covered by those Regulations.Equivalent requirements apply in other European Member States (pursuant to the above Directive) and are supervised by the corresponding regulatory authorities in those Member States. Where those firms have a branch in Ireland, the Financial Regulator supervises their compliance with rules applicable to that branch.In terms of any question as to the validity of such contractual obligations, this is a matter for the Courts. Where the contract is governed by Irish law, the relevant Courts would be those of Ireland. Where it is governed by laws other than those of the State, it will be the Courts of the relevant foreign jurisdiction. For example, there is an international practice for many such contracts to be governed by either English or New York law. Generally speaking, there is not a question over the legal validity of derivative contracts such as credit default swaps and they are of common use in the financial markets and wider domestic and international trade. In the specific case of Ireland, the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995 bolsters the effectiveness of such contracts by providing that the set-off mechanisms (referred to as ‘netting') inherent in such contracts are valid, including on an insolvency of one of the parties.

There are no published figures available in relation to the volumes of these transactions.CFDs represent a way of taking a position on a listed company without actually buying or selling its shares. It is clearly desirable that there should be greater market transparency in relation to such activity. The market should know when a person has a significant holding of CFDs. In fact the Regulations which transposed the EU's Transparency Directive (Directive 2004/109/EC) into Irish law require announcements to be made in relation to financial instruments that provide an option to purchase. However, this is an international issue, given that shares can have multiple listings in different jurisdictions.The Financial Regulator has been in consultation with the UK's Financial Services Authority with a view to arriving at a similar approach in both jurisdictions so as to avoid the scope for regulatory arbitrage. The FSA is pursuing some initiatives in this area and when these are confirmed, I will, following consultation with the Financial Regulator, consider the need for legislation in this country.

The Market Notice issued by my Department on 22 October was not prepared as a requirement under any legislative imperative. It was issued under my general authority to issue a public statement on matters within the remit of my Department. Its purpose was to provide a simple and clear statement to market participants of certain key elements of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008. The Market Notice does not and could not alter the Scheme as approved by the Oireachtas and the European Commission.My Department has not had reason to issue a comparable market notice in the past.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	803	In my Budget speech on 14th October, I announced the introduction of a new tax incentive scheme to facilitate the relocation of Seveso-listed industrial facilities which hinder the residential and commercial regeneration of Docklands in urban areas.  The EU Seveso Directive seeks to protect public safety by placing land-use restrictions on new residential and commercial development near locations where potentially dangerous activities are undertaken.The Deputy will also be aware that I indicated in my speech that this scheme will be subject to clearance by the European Commission from a State Aids perspective.In discussions which have been held between officials and the EU Commission about the regeneration of urban docklands, the Commission has indicated that the use of tax incentives to facilitate the remediation of sites vacated by Seveso-type industrial facilities for any future residential and commercial use will not pass the EU State Aid rules because of the ‘polluter pays principle'.  This ensures that an industry that creates a pollution incident (or in this case, which undertakes the land-use that has damaged a particular location) must bear the cost of remediating the property back to a pre-pollution/pre-damaging land-use basis.

The establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman in 2003 and 2005 respectively means that such a framework is now in place.  It provides, with effect from their establishment, for both strengthened supervision of financial service providers and a forum to which complaints about the actions of financial service providers may be addressed.In dealing with the Deputy's specific question, I am aware that allegations of overcharging have been made against certain financial institutions.  Indeed the issue was fully aired at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs in May 2008.  I am aware that certain allegations of overcharging have been resolved through the intervention of the Financial Regulator and other cases have been investigated by the Financial Services Ombudsman.As the Deputy will be aware, I do not comment on individual cases.  Furthermore, as Minister for Finance, I have no role in relation to the investigation of alleged overcharging by any financial services body.  However, I continue to oversee the effectiveness of the financial regulations already in place to deal with allegations of irregularity and intervene, if necessary, to improve the effectiveness of these regulations.

Once that legislation has been enacted, the task of implementing and applying it on a day-to-day basis rests with the Financial Regulator, which is independent of the Minister in the exercise of its statutory functions.Part IIIc of the Central Bank Act, 1942, as inserted by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004, provides the Financial Regulator with a range of options to deal with contraventions of regulatory requirements, including the power to administer sanctions in respect of prescribed contraventions by regulated financial service providers and persons concerned in the management of regulated financial service providers.  It may also refer certain suspected contraventions to other enforcement bodies or agencies, such as An Garda Síochána or the Director of Public Prosecutions for further investigation.Any sanctions administered by the Financial Regulator are published on its website.  In addition, the Financial Regulator records, in its Annual Reports, the number and types of regulatory actions, including administrative sanctions, in any given year.  As far as the question of the number of cases prosecuted against credit institutions in the courts in this context is concerned, I have forwarded this to the CBFSAI, which will reply directly to the Deputy.

The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 provides that a person to whom the provisions of the Ethics legislation applies can request the Commission (or, for a non-office holding Oireachtas member, the relevant Select Committee on Members' Interests) to give advice to the person in relation to any provision of the legislation or to the application, in any particular case, of any such provision.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	807	The matters raised by the Deputy are dealt with at a number of levels.  In the first instance, the Ethics in Public Office Acts provide a framework for dealing with conflicts of interest which can arise in the course of employment, including in relation to the declaration of interests, and the furnishing of a statement of the facts where a conflict of material interests exists, by Oireachtas members, by special advisers and by those directors and employees to whom the legislation applies in the civil and public sectors.  The Ethics Acts also provide procedures under which complaints on suspected contraventions of the legislation can be dealt with, and provides for codes of conduct, such as the Civil Service Code of Standards & Behaviour, breaches of which are dealt with under the internal procedures of the bodies concerned.Criminal law may also apply as the improper use of inside information is a very serious matter, but legislative protections already exist to cater for the type of situation outlined in the Deputy's question. The 2005 Market Abuse Regulations, made by the  Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, transposed the EU Market Abuse Directive (Directive 2003/6/EC) into national law and set down the parameters for tackling insider dealing and market manipulation, collectively referred to as "market abuse". Regulation 4(1) of these Regulations highlights that they apply to any financial instrument admitted, or pending admission, to trading on a regulated market "whether or not any transaction in or relating to the financial instrument takes place on that market". The Regulations apply to everyone, with certain specific exceptions which are set down in Regulation 4(3). Therefore spread-betting on the price movement of any shares admitted to trading on any regulated market, is covered by the Market Abuse Regulations.The Financial Regulator is the competent authority for the purposes of the Directive and the Regulations provide it with all the necessary monitoring and enforcement powers.Convictions for market abuse carry penalties of a fine of up to €10m or 10 years imprisonment or both, as provided for in Section 32 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005.

The filling of posts in any part of the organisation is approached from this perspective. Revenue had 108 staff serving in Athlone on 15 October, including 34 at Executive Officer level. In the year to date, four Executive Officers have been appointed to Athlone from the Public Appointments Service Panel and there are no immediate plans to make any further such appointments.

It is expected to generate a broadly similar or slightly higher surplus in 2008 and in 2009.  The amount of lottery funding transferred to the Exchequer in 2007 to part-fund the various programmes in various Government Departments was €230m while the corresponding amount which will be transferred in 2008 is €260m.  The amount which will be transferred in 2009 is expected to be in line with the 2008 figure.Total expenditure on programmes part-funded by receipts from the National Lottery amounted to €444m in 2007 and is estimated to be €466m in 2008.  Total expenditure on such programmes in 2009 is estimated at €448m.  A table showing allocations by Department for subheads part-funded by the National Lottery in 2007 and 2008 is included in Appendix I of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2008.  A similar table will be published in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009. The ratio of aggregate National Lottery funding to aggregate Exchequer funding in 2007 was 52: 48 while the corresponding ratio in 2008 is expected to be 56:44.  The ratio of National Lottery to Exchequer funding in 2009 is expected to be broadly in line with the 2008 ratio.

Looking at the situation for all Irish credit institutions, which mirrors developments in the sub-set mentioned above, the amount of deposits held by Irish residents in overnight deposit accounts between September 2007 and September 2008 declined by 12.9 per cent.  However, this was more than counterbalanced by the increase in term accounts of 22 per cent, or €18 billion.  This would suggest that Irish people may be moving their deposits from overnight deposits, which generally offer low interest rates, into accounts with much higher interest rates, such as those with an agreed maturity.The Central Bank informs me that the amount of credit accounted for by overdrafts can be quite volatile.  Their statistics show that over the year to August 2008, overdrafts for households increased by €512 million, but decreased by €63 million for non-financial corporates.There is no doubt that banks faced a harder task of raising funds over the past twelve months, due to the difficulties in interbank money markets.  However, analysis of credit institutions' balance sheets show how banks have adapted to this by accessing different sources of funding. For example, borrowing from the European Central Bank has increased, which shows that Irish credit institutions have adequate collateral to draw down this form of lending. Decisive action to protect the stability of the economy and its financial system was taken by the Government with the introduction of the Scheme made under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008. The extended international credit crunch which we have experienced has brought home to all of us the pivotal role of the financial system in the economy and in the day-to-day lives of ordinary people. An important aim of the Guarantee Scheme the Government have introduced is to ensure that we have a banking system that as a whole works effectively, efficiently and competitively in facilitating all the day-to-day ordinary economic transactions of commercial, business, family and social life. The scheme therefore includes the application of strict terms and conditions on covered institutions to ensure that the public interest, which includes the general consumer and small business sector, is paramount.By putting the Guarantee Scheme in place the Government is helping to ensure that financial institutions continue to play their proper role in facilitating economic activity and enterprise and important financial transactions of households.

The banks will be releasing accounts and information over the coming months.  The Financial Regulator clearly takes a direct interest in this issue, with a view to ensuring financial stability.  I understand that the Regulator is engaged in an exercise at present to review the loan books and business plans of the guaranteed institutions.As regards the capital position of the banks, each institution must take appropriate steps to ensure that their levels of capital are aligned with their needs.  The State has a keen interest in the stability of the banking institutions, because of their role in the economy.  Clearly, my Department, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator will be in continuing contact with the institutions on their business plans, their capital position and their liquidity. Under the guarantee scheme, institutions can be required to adjust their capital ratios if that is required for the maintenance of financial stability.

The change could have been made effective from 1 November 2008, the start of the preceding VAT taxable period, however, the later date of 1 December 2008 was chosen in order to give industry more time to adjust their systems to the Budget change.  This provided a lead-in time of almost seven weeks during which traders can adjust to the new rate.While the change in the VAT rate is effective from 1 December 2008, it is important to note that this does not impose any additional obligations on business in terms of their VAT returns.  Businesses will file returns as normal on 19 January 2008.In order to clarify the effect of the change in the standard VAT rate and its implications in different business circumstances, the Revenue Commissioners website contains detailed information in this regard.

However, I am not aware of any concrete proposals to make changes to US tax legislation. While there has been some speculation in the context of the Presidential election that any new Administration could seek to make changes to the tax code, it is merely speculation and I am not prepared to comment on it.I do not need to remind the House of the importance of US investment to the Irish economy which has been valued by successive Irish Governments over the last forty years.  Irish investment in the US is also of significance. In that context it would be remiss of me not to be mindful of the sensitivity of investment decisions to the overall economic environment that would prevail including the tax environment that could undermine such decisions.

Under the Scheme covered institutions are also required to submit reports required by the Financial Regulator to monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  These reports will deal with, inter alia, liquidity requirements, capital ratios, asset quality, risk exposures and funding costs, and be submitted with such frequency and in such form as the Financial Regulator requires.  Covered institutions will also be required to report on their compliance with the scheme itself on a quarterly basis and with the Irish Banking Federation Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code, at such frequency as I may require.The reporting requirements under the scheme are additional to the regulatory framework already in place whereby all Irish licensed credit institutions report their solvency and liquidity positions to the Financial Regulator on an ongoing basis and the Financial Regulator has full legal powers to seek relevant information from the credit institutions in order to fulfil its statutory mandate.The Deputy will appreciate that I will be working closely with the Financial Regulator regarding the reporting requirements under the Scheme.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	818	Improving our competitive position is essential to facilitate a re-balancing of the economy towards more sustainable, export-led growth and to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a location for inward investment.In recognition of this, and notwithstanding the need to underpin the sustainability of the public finances, the Government took a number of steps in Budget 2009 aimed at supporting the economy's competitiveness.  These included re-affirming our commitment to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax and maintaining and enhancing pro-employment business tax reliefs.  We are also continuing to prioritise productivity enhancing investment under the National Development Plan.  These measures will ensure that the Irish economy is well placed to take advantage of the global pick-up when it emerges.National competitiveness is not, however, solely a matter of Government policy. Rather it is a shared responsibility of all the Social Partners — Government, employers and unions.  Regaining our competitive position, which as a small open economy is critical to our economic success, will require each of us to play our part and work together to this end.This means ensuring that externally-driven price increases do not become embedded in our system as that only creates a vicious cycle from which no one wins.  In this respect, the willingness of the various parties to compromise and adopt a realistic approach to wage developments in the recent pay talks is commendable.  In addition, it will be important to ensure that improvements in external factors that impact on domestic costs, such as falling oil prices, are passed on.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	820	I have met with the relevant institutions and there is ongoing contact between the Financial Services Regulator, the Central Bank, the credit institutions and officials of my Department.The Deputy will appreciate that when I introduced the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Legislation to this house, I made it clear that the disruption in international financial markets required a strong and decisive response by the Government to underpin the commitment of the authorities to Ireland's financial stability.  This Government moved swiftly to put in place a guarantee to ensure Irish financial institutions' access to the normal liquidity and funding for their day to day business, and to give confidence to depositors and wholesale lenders.  The Government quickly demonstrated its resolve to support the financial system, in order to support the economy and society, enterprises and families.In tandem with the guarantee, the intensified scrutiny and oversight of financial institutions which was put in place since the onset of the turmoil in financial markets has been maintained and further strengthened to ensure that high standards of regulation are achieved in Ireland and that the quality of corporate Governance applying in all institutions, including lending practices, safeguard the interests of taxpayers.  The goal at the end of this process is a banking system that is "fit for purpose" for the transformed financial environment in which it will find itself operating in the coming decades.The legislation provides a detailed framework for the authorities to oversee and guide the assessment of strategic options by the banks themselves.  The Irish scheme is firmly aligned with the main themes of the euro group plan, which contains an option to provide additional capital resources where appropriate to the banks.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	821	From the outset of the financial market difficulties in August 2007 EU Finance Ministers have taken a number of steps to address the difficulties in financial markets and Ireland has of course been a full participant in that work.In October 2007 Finance Ministers agreed on a set of common principles and a roadmap of further actions to enhance financial stability arrangements and the ability of authorities to respond to serious disturbances in financial markets.  This programme involves reviewing along with the EU's international partners how to further improve transparency of complex financial instruments, valuation standards, the prudential framework, risk management and supervision and market functioning including the role of rating agencies.  Arising from this work, EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed an extended Memorandum of Understanding on financial stability contingency planning between financial supervisors, central banks and finance ministries that incorporates common principles and practical guidelines for cross-border cooperation. This came into effect in June 2008.At their meeting on 7th October 2008 EU Finance Ministers agreed common principles to guide the actions of Member States aimed at preserving confidence and stability in financial markets. The Finance Ministers welcomed the EU Commission's continued commitment to act quickly and apply flexibility in state aid decisions within the framework of the single market and state aid regime. The Commission has issued guidance for Member States on how decisions within this framework can be rapidly assessed.The prompt actions by international central banks, including the European Central Bank, to provide major injections of liquidity have contributed to greater stability in financial markets internationally, though markets continue to remain subject to significant uncertainties. The ability of Irish banks to access liquidity from the European Central Bank has been a major benefit and provided a significant strength in assisting the Irish financial system to withstand difficult financial conditions over the last year.

However, it is now clear that we have entered a period of lower economic growth than was envisaged when the Programme for Government was drawn up.

The ability of Government to deliver on all aspects of the programme must be seen in the context of this overriding priority.

That information is used for internal staff management purposes. The identification of suitable groups against which it can be meaningfully benchmarked is currently being explored.As in the case of all organisations, allowance is made for leave entitlements in determining overall staffing complements. There is no specific system in place in my Department to estimate the costs of lost input  or cover which is only provided in exceptional cases. Accordingly, absences rarely give rise to direct additional costs.  I would also like to refer the Deputy to my response to Questions 237 and 238 raised by Deputy Leo Varadkar on 21 October 2008 which addressed the matter of sick leave absence levels in my Department and offices under its aegis.

In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matters raised by the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	837	Regulation (EC) 1408/71 provides, inter alia, that people who are insured with or covered by the health care system of one member state may access health care in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances. Article 22 (1) (c) of the Regulation governs the referral of patients for public health services to another member state. In accordance with this article, a person eligible for health services in Ireland must be authorised by the HSE to go to another member state for treatment in the public health system there, where certain criteria are met. When authorisation is granted, Form E112 is issued by the HSE and is confirmation that the HSE will bear the cost of the treatment.It is a matter for the HSE to determine whether authorisation for treatment abroad should be granted. Therefore, any individual who is eligible for health care in Ireland and who wishes to obtain treatment in another EU member state in accordance with these entitlements should apply to the HSE for authorisation.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	839	Achieving and maintaining the highest possible standards of hygiene in our hospitals and health care facilities generally is a priority for this Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Hygiene and infection control measures are key to the prevention of the spread of Healthcare Associated Infections in our hospital system.I am informed that as part of the standard infection control policies within the hospital, Letterkenny General Hospital will be carrying out an internal review of the circumstances leading to and consequent management of the recent cluster of MRSA cases in its maternity unit.  This is normal infection control practice.It should be noted that it is not unique for babies to test positive for MRSA, whether in a hospital setting or at home in the community.  On this occasion what was different, was that 3 babies tested positive for MRSA within a very short timeframe.  Again, although unusual, this is not unique.  The infection control protocols and the pro-active actions of the hospital resulted in all the babies being identified and treated in a very short period of time.  There was also clear and open communication with all the families involved.  The source of the colonisation was also identified and measures were taken to ensure that no further babies could be colonised from this source.  It must be stressed that although the babies were colonised, at no time were they ill or have a blood stream infection.Despite some attempts and speculation aiming to link these cases to any previous cases of MRSA within the hospital, this cluster of MRSA was a discrete event.  The hospital kept the HSE and my Department advised of the measures it was undertaking throughout its management of this issue.  The Hospital has clear clinical governance processes which allow for the review of incidents such as this and enable the hospital to learn from the process.

The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people's care needs are met in the primary care setting.Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties. In 2007,  the HSE Vote included almost €37 million in baseline funding for these services and the Executive has advised that this figure is available again in 2008. This figure does not include the fees of the participating doctors.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for this service, it is the appropriate body to provide the information sought by the Deputy . My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	845	The National Disability Strategy specifically provides for a targeted Investment Programme, which was announced in the 2005 Budget, of some €900m capital and revenue funding for the period 2006 to 2009, to build capacity in priority areas of support services for people with disabilities. Under the Multi-Annual Investment Programme additional funding of €75m was allocated in both 2006 and 2007 and €50m in 2008.  In the 2008 Budget, €50m was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to fund a range of additional services under the Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability.  Although the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed due to a financial review, I am pleased to inform you that the Executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that it is now in the process of rolling out the planned developments.  The HSE has indicated that due to the delayed start to some of these developments, it expects to spend €33m of the €50m by the end of 2008.  The resulting €17m time related savings were included in this Department's budgetary consolidation measures announced to the House in July 2008.In Budget 2009, an additional €10m was allocated to the HSE.  The funding for 2009 will provide for 90 additional therapy posts in the disability services area, targeted at children of school going age.With regard to the yearly expenditure incurred to date on the Programme, this is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

It is intended that this additional funding will enable the services provided to children with special educational needs to be enhanced and strengthened.  The additional €10m allocated to the HSE will provide for 125 additional therapy posts in the disability and mental health services, targeted at children of school-going age.  This will provide an additional 90 posts in the disability services area, to include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists for children's disability services.  There will be 35 additional posts for the child & adolescent mental health services, including clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and speech & language therapists for new and existing multidisciplinary teams.

In September 2006, the Commission replaced the individual local authority taximeter areas with one single national taximeter area.With regard to taxi ranks, decisions regarding the location and operation of taxi ranks on public roads, as well as the provision of funding for taxi ranks, are primarily matters for consideration by the relevant local authority.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 1 June 2001 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e why he should not be deported.His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. The person concerned submitted an application for EU Treaty Rights. The person concerned was informed by letter dated 8 July 2004 that his application had been refused.

The Convention is provided for in legislation in this State by virtue of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997 and the process is administered by my Department.The process requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between the relevant  jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered.  A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and their continued detention here.I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has not as yet received a formal application for a transfer to Ireland in respect of this person from the United Kingdom authorities.  My officials have contacted the UK authorities responsible for such repatriations regarding this matter and they have stated that they have not received an application from the person concerned either.  If she has not already done so, she should now apply for a transfer via her Prison Governor in the United Kingdom.I would also like to inform the Deputy that officials of my Department have brought this matter to the attention of their colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Department of Foreign Affairs have indicated that the person concerned has not sought consular assistance from them.  However, the matter has now been brought to the attention of our Embassy in the UK who will make further inquiries.

A significant proportion of all absences relate to statutory entitlements or conditions of employment.  In relation to these leave entitlements (annual leave, maternity leave, parental leave, carer's leave, force majeure leave, bereavement leave, etc.), the question of benchmarking against best standards does not arise.  In relation to sick leave absence, the Comptroller and Auditor General is undertaking a Value for Money Audit on sick leave absence across the Civil Service and I look forward to reading his Report in due course.  In the meantime, I am satisfied that my Department's level of sick leave absence at 4% is comparable with other public sector organisations.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	898	The issue of extraordinary rendition has been raised on numerous occasions in this House.  As has been made repeatedly clear, the Government is completely opposed to the practice of the extraordinary rendition of prisoners.  I wish to reiterate at the outset that none of the various investigations into allegations of extraordinary rendition have revealed any evidence, or even resulted in a specific allegation, that any person has on any occasion been subjected to extraordinary rendition through Ireland.   The Government has received clear and specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.  These assurances are of a clear and categoric nature and have been confirmed at the highest level . I am confident that this would continue to be the case under a new US administration.  The Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Aspects of International Human Rights.  As part of its remit, the Committee has reviewed the Programme for Government commitments in relation to our total opposition to extraordinary rendition.With a view to strengthening as necessary the legislative provisions, the Committee is to review the statutory powers currently available to the civil and police authorities regarding the search and inspection of aircraft, in the context of the obligations on the State under the Chicago Convention.  We have stated on a number of occasions that the Gardaí have full powers of search and inspection where they have reasonable grounds for suspicion. In keeping with the Programme for Government and in the light of international developments, we believe that this is an opportune time to confirm that the legislation is as effective as it can be in this area, and to address, if necessary, any area where it may be improved.The Committee has agreed that early contact should be made with the new US Administration to seek a clear statement of intent that extraordinary rendition would cease and would not resume during the new President's term of office.  I would emphasise that, while we have no reason to doubt the existing assurances in respect of the use of Irish airports, what we are looking for is a clear overall policy statement which would commit the new Administration to end the practice of extraordinary rendition wherever it may be occurring.In addition, commitments are also being sought in regard to the early closure of Guantanamo Bay and to the clear prohibition of intensive interrogation techniques such as water-boarding which are internationally considered to constitute torture.  I have asked our Ambassador in Washington to follow up on these issues as a matter of urgency.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	899	Israel is a key partner of the European Union in the Mediterranean, and an active member of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.  The relationship between the EU and Israel is governed mainly by the EU-Israel Association Agreement and its associated Action Plan.  The eighth annual meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council was held in June 2008, and the current EU-Israel Action Plan is due to be completed in April 2009.On specifics, the co-operation between the EU and Israel across a range of technical and practical fields, such as transport, energy and social affairs, has been very good. Indeed, Israel's highly developed institutional structures and public administration have enabled it to lead the way among Mediterranean countries in many cooperation projects.With the completion of the current Action Plan in April next, it is logical that its successor will seek to build on and to deepen existing cooperation. In this regard, Israel has presented ideas on how relations might develop further.  The EU has agreed in principle to this approach, but discussions on what might be involved have only just begun and will inevitably take some time.As regards dialogue on political and human rights issues, these form an essential part of the EU's contractual relations with its neighbours, including those in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.  Of their nature, this often involves disagreement and hard talking. In this regard, the EU has often been strongly critical of Israel in relation to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, the process to reach a viable two State solution, and the rights of the Palestinian people. Importantly, this dialogue has provided the EU with a formal and regular channel to convey its views to Israel on these crucial matters, although of course the issues in question are also raised in many other fora.The EU has stated that it sees deeper engagement on all these issues as an essential element of the enhancing of EU-Israel relations.  This should include a strengthened political dialogue, stronger involvement of the EU in the peace process and in monitoring the situation on the ground, and the establishment of a full and separate subcommittee of the dialogue dealing with human rights issues.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	900	The relationship between Ireland and the United States is deep, close and enduring. Successive Presidents and their Administrations, and Ireland's many friends on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle, have made an enormous contribution to bringing peace and economic prosperity to this island.Following the US Presidential election on 4 November 2008, the President and Taoiseach have written to congratulate President-elect Barack Obama on his victory.  The Government look forward to working with the new President and his Administration in the years ahead to underpin and deepen further the economic, cultural and social relations between the United States and Ireland.  Likewise, we will continue to work closely with the bipartisan Friends of Ireland in Congress, chaired by Congressman Richard Neal.This close cooperation is, of course, underpinned by the network of relations with members of Congress and their staff maintained by the Embassy in Washington.  The Ambassador and his colleagues attach the highest priority to their work in this area, and, following yesterday's US elections, will be active in ensuring that Ireland's interests continue to be effectively advanced with the new Administration and Congress.  In this regard, the level of staffing in our missions in the United States, and our Honorary Consul system, is kept under ongoing review.Aware of the need to constantly update the relationship, and recognising the changing circumstances on both sides of the Atlantic, our Ambassador in Washington has been asked by the Taoiseach to lead a strategic review of Ireland/US relations, and to report on this by the end of the year.  The review is intended to facilitate the further development of this important relationship, and to explore how our already close ties might be further enhanced in the future. Considerable work on the review has already taken place and the Ambassador has invited organizations and individuals across the United States to contribute their views.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	901	The presidential campaign in the United States has just concluded.  President Barack Obama will take up office on 20 January 2009 and the new Congress will meet for the first time on 6 January 2009.  The campaign of the President-elect put forward a range of proposals on the US economy, trade and taxation.  However, it is too early to know how these proposals will take shape and, therefore, what their implications may be for Ireland.The Embassy in Washington, in co-ordination with the IDA, will continue to monitor these issues closely and to keep the Government fully informed of any possible developments so that, if necessary, appropriate action can be taken quickly and effectively.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	902	My Department monitors absence through the Civil Service's Human Resources Management System (HRMS). All absences are recorded on HRMS, which is administered centrally by the Department of Finance.  The recording of absences is managed by my Department's Human Resources Section.  All HQ-based staff at grades up to, and including, Higher Executive Officer register their attendance using a flexi clock.  At more senior grades and in our Missions abroad, attendance is monitored and reported on directly by line managers.The average levels of absenteeism within my Department during the past five years are set out below.  Each figure given is the total number of days lost to absence expressed as a percentage of the total available working days for staff in the Department.2003:  1.98%;2004:  2.28%;2005:  2.57%;2006:  2.76%;2007:  3.58%.In general, most absences in my Department are short-term in nature and do not require cover to be provided.  Where a long-term absence arises, the question of cover is considered on a case-by-case basis and, if needed, such cover is drawn from existing resources. In some cases, an absent officer may be replaced temporarily by a junior colleague, usually from the same Section, who is paid an acting-up to higher duties allowance.  The allowance is equivalent to the difference between the junior colleague's existing salary and the first point of the salary scale for the grade at which they are acting up.Staff on certified long-term sick leave are entitled to full pay for a maximum of six months in any one year and half pay thereafter, subject to a maximum of twelve months' sick leave in any period of four years or less. Uncertified sick leave absences in excess of the limits prescribed by the Department of Finance may result in disciplinary action, including the withholding of salary increments.  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is currently undertaking an examination of the management of sickness absences in the Civil Service. My Department is cooperating with the Office in this regard.

This tracking is done in consultation with line managers in the Department as appropriate.  A significant proportion of all absences relate to statutory entitlements or conditions of employment such as annual leave, maternity leave, parental leave, bereavement leave etc, where the question of benchmarking against best standards does not arise.While the Department monitors sick leave absences it does not benchmark them against best standards but, as the Deputy will be aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General is currently carrying out an examination on the management of sickness absences across the civil service and the Department which has provided information to the C&AG in this exercise will implement any recommendations arising from this examination.

I understand that this system is used by all Government Departments and that, while it does not have a specific facility to benchmark absences as referred to by the Deputy, it does enable my Department to review and monitor the attendance patterns of staff and to take follow-up action, where required.Any cost arising in relation to providing cover where staff are absent from work is nominal, as dedicated cover is only provided for staff in the case of maternity absences. In such cases, a higher duties allowance is paid to the lower grade to act up in place of the officer on maternity leave and the consequential lower post remains unfilled. Estimating any lost input due to absences and the taking of appropriate action is the responsibility of line managers in my Department, who review progress in respect of the implementation of their annual business plans on a regular basis.With regard to data relating to absenteeism in my Department, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No 404 of 21 October 2008.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	913	It is currently estimated that the balance of the social insurance fund will be approximately €3.4 billion, based on an expected annual deficit of €223 million, at end 2008. For end 2009, the balance is estimated to be €2.5 billion, based on an expected annual deficit of €900 million. A projected outturn for 2010 has not yet been finalised.These estimates are similar to those of the second Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which was required under Section 10 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, and published on 17th October 2007 in conjunction with the Green Paper on Pensions.The findings of the Review included:That the Fund will move from being in surplus to running a deficit in 2009;That on foot of the annual deficits from 2009, the accumulated surplus of the fund will be exhausted by 2016.However, in the light of current economic circumstances it is now expected that the accumulated surplus will be exhausted prior to 2016.In this regard it should be noted that legislation provides that the exchequer is the residual financier of the fund and exchequer contributions to cover any shortfalls in contributions were the norm for over forty years.  No exchequer contribution has been required since 1996 as the fund has been in surplus on foot of contributions from employers and workers. Any shortfall in the fund, in meeting the cost of benefits paid, would in the normal way be addressed by exchequer subvention.Issues relating to social insurance contribution rates, payments, and possible future exchequer subventions to the fund, would have to be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	914	The primary purpose of credited contributions is to preserve the continuity of a person's insurance record during periods when they are unable to work and pay PRSI in the normal way.  In order to qualify for credited contributions, absences from work would generally have to be for reasons outside of the person's control, such as periods of proven illness or registered unemployment, or periods during which they may be entitled to certain other social welfare payments.Credited contributions are not generally available in circumstances where a person voluntarily ceases insurable employment on a temporary or permanent basis. This reflects the contributory principle that underpins the qualifying conditions for all social insurance payments. However, a person taking time off work to care for children up to 12 years of age, or an incapacitated adult, may be entitled to avail of the homemaker's scheme whereby such periods can be taken into account for state contributory pension purposes at age 66.One of the qualifying conditions for contributory pensions requires that the applicant must have a minimum yearly average number of paid or credited contributions throughout their working lives.  Therefore, any prolonged gaps in insurance cover are likely to have significant consequences with regard to pension entitlement.In the case of short-term benefits such as job-seekers allowance, illness, and treatment benefits a person may retain entitlement to such payments for a limited period after their last PRSI contribution but entitlement would then lapse unless further reckonable contributions are recorded on their behalf.Subject to certain statutory conditions, it may be open to a person on a career break to pay voluntary contributions.  However, it should be noted that voluntary contributions are reckonable only with regard to state contributory pension, transition pension and widows/widowers contributory pension.

As an alleviating measure, the age for entitlement to the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) would be increased from 16 to 18 years from the same date.   These measures were estimated to save €5.6 million on the Department of Social and Family Affairs Vote while giving rise to a cost of €1.4 million on the HSE Vote.  Accordingly, the net saving to the Exchequer in 2009 was expected to be of the order of €4.2m.As I have already announced, these measures will not now proceed.  The consequential impact on the Social and Family Affairs Vote equates to 0.04% of expenditure and will be accommodated by on-going efficiencies across the whole range of the Department's activities next year.   It will not be necessary to introduce further measures affecting entitlements or payments.  The amount of €1.4 million which will not now be required for the DCA measure will be transferred from the HSE Vote to the Social and Family Affairs Vote in the Revised Estimates.

As part of the process of preparing this policy, the Department researched examples of best practice available in Irish and UK organisations.   The inclusion in the Policy of practices such as return to work interviews, a Health Promotion Policy and supports for staff who are returning to work after a long term illness reflects this research.The Department prepares reports for managers on a quarterly and annual basis of all sick leave absences that occur in the Department in order to support them in the management of attendance.  These reports contain information in relation to numbers, duration, lost work days etc arising from work absences.In addition, the Department uses the Administrative Productivity Training (APT) method of work measurement which is used to identify, measure and quantify workloads and to determine staffing requirements.  This provides for a core figure of staffing for each business unit in the Department.   The measurement includes a set 14.3% absence reserve. This absence reserve covers all normal levels of annual, sick and special leave.

The programme focuses mainly on infrastructural projects comprising the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings.In the period 2000 to 2008 the Department has spent approximately € 1,000,000 on refurbishment and capital projects in Rockhill and € 320,000 in Lifford. The majority of the expenditure in Rockhill was required to maintain and conserve the fabric of what is a listed building, thus protecting its structural integrity.

This system provides a suite of reporting tools for monitoring and analysing absence data.  Absences arise for many reasons, such as annual leave, sick leave, worksharing and career breaks.  Absenteeism is usually defined as the time lost attributable to sickness or any other cause not excused through statutory entitlements or conditions of employment.  A report on sick leave in my Department for recent years is as follows:YearLost Time Rate20064.4%20074.8%These rates compare favourably against international public sector norms.  My Department has in place a range of measures to identify, manage, monitor and control absenteeism due to sickness, including the measures and initiatives adopted to promote well being and attendance.  In managing sickness absences, my Department also employs an Employee Assistance Officer and avails of the services of the CMO in respect of medical issues.

These regulations, which apply to all rented dwellings including dwellings let by housing authorities, are currently under review and I expect to bring forward updated regulations shortly.Through funding for remedial and regeneration programmes, significant improvements are being made in bringing the quality of older elements of the social housing stock up to modern standards, including from an energy efficiency perspective.  In particular, my Department introduced a major initiative in 2004, providing for the installation of central heating in those local authority rented dwellings which lacked such facilities. It is a requirement under this initiative that all eligible works must include, where necessary, measures to ensure the energy efficiency of the dwelling, such as attic insulation to Building Regulation standards, draught proofing to existing windows and external doors, and the lagging of exposed pipe work and hot water cylinders.By end 2007, my Department had co-funded the installation of central heating and associated energy efficiency measures in some 19,600 houses at a cost to the Exchequer of €94 million. A further €26 million has been allocated in 2008 to continue the programme.In addition, I have recently announced that a full audit of the public housing stock will begin in 2009, to lay the foundation for a programme of retrofitting, where required, to deliver modern standards of energy efficiency.  €5 million is being provided in 2009 for a number of retrofitting pilot projects, which will inform the approach to the wider roll-out of the retrofitting programme in due course.Furthermore, local authorities and voluntary/co-operative housing bodies have been invited to submit proposals for demonstration projects for the delivery of sustainable energy efficient housing developments that will exceed the anticipated 2010 standards of the Building Regulations Part L.  Funding of €20m will be made available to support this ‘Towards Carbon Neutral' programme, significantly advancing the knowledge and experience base in the design, construction and use of high performing energy efficient housing.

One of these conditions is that the ICC must report on each hare coursing meeting held.In relation to the 19 hare coursing meetings referred to in the question, my Department has received reports on 14 of these meetings to date.  The reports for the meetings scheduled to take place on 1 and 2 November 2008 have not yet been received.The number of hares killed or which subsequently died at the meetings reported upon was 22 compared to 27 at the equivalent meetings held last year.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  I have no role in private sector broadband infrastructure investment undertaken by broadband service providers.  However, it is hoped that the facilitation of greater competition in the sector via the introduction of broadband from different technology platforms, will encourage more rapid enabling of all exchanges for broadband.I would add that in addition to fixed landline broadband, otherwise known as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or broadband over telephone lines, broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms including cable, fixed wireless and increasingly mobile.  I understand that Belclare already has broadband on offer from a number of service providers.

Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to  ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect Education, while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure,  could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding  restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these  are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need  to manage Exchequer resources prudently.Specific information in relation to the detailed staffing allocations that  individual schools will have for the commencement of the academic year 2009/10  cannot be determined until the allocation processes have fully concluded.   There is nothing exceptional in this.  The allocation processes include  appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due  to them under the staffing schedules.  This is particularly relevant at  post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any  specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  At post-primary, there is  no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that  schools retain teachers, though over quota, and in addition discrete  allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils  with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties and these  allocations can also alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to  any over quota position.Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their  enrolment as of 30 September.  My Department has commenced processing this data  although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation processes  including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.

Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and  ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect, education, while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure,  could not be entirely spared.

However, these are the  inevitable result of the challenging international economic environment and the  need to manage Exchequer resources.With regard to the removal of certain support services grants received by  Protestant fee-charging schools, I wish to re-emphasise that the Protestant  Block grant remains in place. Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will  continue to receive, this grant, which amounts to €6.25 million in the current  school year.This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.  It is distributed  by the Secondary Education Committee among needier Protestant children.   Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority,  which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual  schools on the basis of pupil needs.The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance that I, and this  Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of the Protestant  faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.In retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate  arrangements that were agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme  was introduced by Donagh O'Malley and, at the time, it was the payment of the  block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that  distinguished them from those Catholic schools that chose to continue to charge  fees.It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue to my Department as a  result of the withdrawal of support services grants from Protestant  fee-charging schools in 2009.It is important to note that the purpose of these grants was not to offset fees  for disadvantaged Protestant students.  Rather, they covered a range of support  services.I have had to take decisions on a number of grants that have impacted on the  funding of schools generally.  With the Protestant Block grant protected, I can  see no justification for treating the Protestant fee-charging schools in a  special way, particularly given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not  been in receipt of the grants in question at all.

Cork that the children in question are availing of a public transport  service and that the combined travel and waiting times for these children are  within the guidelines of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme.As a general rule, special school transport services are not established in  areas where scheduled public services already exist.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	948	I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 to 260, inclusive, together.The School Completion Programme is a key component of DEIS ( Delivering  Equality of Opportunities in Schools) the action plan for educational  inclusion, which discriminates positively in favour of children and young  people who are at risk of early school leaving. The Programme supports 468  primary and 224 post-primary schools in 124 School Completion Programme sites  across 26 counties, focusing on young people between the ages of 4 and 18  years, which aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation  levels in the education process. Funding is provided to projects based on an  integrated approach involving the schools, parents, relevant statutory,  voluntary and community agencies to devise and implement strategies for the  whole-school, targeted strategies for individual students, and those who are  already outside of the formal system. Provision includes in-school,  after-school and holiday time supports to enhance the young person's readiness  to benefit from education.€28.8 million was allocated to the School Completion Programme in 2007 with  €31.1 million allocated for 2008. The programme is funded on a multi-annual  basis under the National Development Plan (NDP) and was assisted under the  European Social Fund (ESF) up to 2007.As the Deputy will be aware, the Education budget for 2009 has been increased by some  €302 million. Notwithstanding this, a number of tough and difficult decisions  have had to be taken, which have seen a number of spending cuts across the  education sector. Funding for the School Completion Programme in 2009 will  remain at the same level as in 2008 and Projects will be notified of their  allocation for 2008/09 shortly.€526,600 was allocated in total to the projects referred to by the Deputy for  2006/07 and 2007/08.  The level of funding allocated to projects is dependent  on the submission of their annual Retention plan, taking into account the level  of educational disadvantage in the schools involved in each project, the target  group selected for intensive supports, the salaries of personnel employed and  the overall level of funding available to the programme.A response to correspondence received by my office from the project to which  the Deputy refers will issue in the next few days.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	949	My Department makes a specific allocation of teaching posts in respect of  guidance to schools in the second level system. This allocation is based on the  pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year.As a result of the decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance  from September 2005 an enhanced guidance allocation provision has been put in  place from the commencement of the 2005/06 school year. This enhanced provision  means that in the case of schools in the Free Education/Block Grant Schemes,  the level of allocation ranges from 8 hours per week for schools with  enrolments below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment  of 1,000 pupils or more. The additional posts included provision for a further  improvement in the allocation of Guidance hours for post-primary schools  participating in the DEIS programme — Delivering Equality of Opportunity in  Schools. The allocation for these schools now ranges from 11 hours per week for  schools with enrolments below 300 to 55 hours per week for schools with an  enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. There are currently a total of 708 whole  time equivalent posts allocated for guidance in post primary schools.

It was originally intended that my Department would acquire  the lands directly and negotiations were progressing on that basis. The  school's Patron indicated that he was willing, in principle, to acquire the  lands in order to advance the project subject to the Patron receiving a  guarantee in relation to the timing of the building project.For my part, I wrote to the Patron indicating that if the Patron was in a  position to confirm that the lands would be acquired then my Department would  commence the appointment of a Design Team.My officials met with representatives of the school and the Patron earlier this  week to discuss, inter alia, the site acquisition.  The Patron's representative  formally confirmed to my officials that the Patron would purchase the required  lands for the new school.  I am advised that in response my officials indicated  that the Department will  now formally write to the Local Authority to apprise  same of the updated position.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	952	The building project for the school to which the Deputy refers is in the early stages of architectural planning.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	953	The issue of the re-introduction of third level fees, to which the Deputy refers, should be viewed in the context of the wider funding of higher education.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is investing unprecedented levels  of public funding in higher education.  In 2008 some €2 billion is being  invested in our third level sector.  In contributing to the achievement of  national policy goals for social and economic development into the future, it  can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for  our higher education sector. It is appropriate to raise questions around how  future additional resource needs can be met and in particular how our higher  education institutions can be supported in their development ambitions through  a widening of their non-exchequer sources of income.  The introduction of a  form of student contribution, which would only be applied to those who can  afford to pay it, is one possibility that merits debate.My Department is, at present, conducting a review of policy options relating to  the introduction of a form of student contribution.  It is my intention,  following completion of the review currently underway, to bring proposals to  Government in relation to the available options.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	954	The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect the education sector, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.Vote 26: Education & Science was increased by €302m which was a real achievement in the current economic climate and was one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009.On Budget day I made it clear however, that even with the increased allocation in 2009, tough and difficult decisions had to be taken in order to work within this level of resources. I took no joy in making those decisions.  They would not have been taken if we were not facing such ominous financial circumstances.In the circumstances outlined above, I am not in a position to reverse any of the decisions taken.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	955	The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.The detailed staffing allocation for the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation process has fully concluded.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation process including notification to all primary schools will commence early in the New Year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	956	The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it.  We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts.  By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment.  This will be done on a case by case basis.The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically.  Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.

In July 2006, my Department agreed, that contractors who retrofitted safety belts in accordance with installation standards approved by the Department of Transport, were eligible for a grant equivalent to half the cost of retrofitting their vehicles, subject to a maximum grant of €3,000 for a large vehicle.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	959	There are 56 fee-paying schools in the State, of which 21 are Protestant, two inter-denominational, one Jewish and the remainder Catholic.With the exception of the Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools, fee-paying schools do not receive capitation or related supports.Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, the Protestant Block grant, which amounts to €6.25 million in the current school year.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.A similar arrangement exists for the Jewish school and amounted to €43,684 in the 2007/08 school year.  This arrangement will continue also.The arrangements for minority schools reflect the importance the Government attaches to ensuring that students can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.Prior to Budget 2009, minority religion schools were eligible other non-pay grants.  It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue to the Department from their withdrawal in 2009.Teachers in all fee-charging schools are paid by the State, and this arrangement pre-dated the introduction of free education arrangements.  The cost for the 2007/08 school year was €100.12 million.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	961	Overall the number of primary and post-primary teachers in schools in September 2009 is projected to be about 200 fewer in each sector compared to September 2008.The estimates are calculated on the basis that approximately 900 additional posts in primary schools and 320 such posts in post-primary schools are needed due to demographics and the continued growth in provision for children with special educational needs in schools.The estimates are also calculated on the basis that the 900 additional primary posts will reduce by 340 (to 560) as a result of the reducing demand for language support teachers and reduced requirements because of decreases in pupil numbers in certain special classes.In addition to the normal increases and decreases set out above, there are also policy changes announced as part of the Budget and 2009 estimates that provide for decreases in teaching post numbers arising from changes to the staffing schedules that allocate teachers to schools, the re-imposition of the ceiling on the number of language support teachers per school and the withdrawal of teaching posts which have been historically provided under previous disadvantage schemes to non-DEIS schools.  It is estimated that these will decrease the number of teaching posts by approximately 760 posts in primary education and 560 in post-primary education.Thus while it is estimated that there is of the order of a 200 net decrease in the number teaching posts in both primary and post-primary education, this also means that there will be a higher turnover of teachers to reflect the overall changes of allocations and teachers moving to new posts as a consequence of reflect the changes.  The figures, both for increases and decreases in the estimated number of teaching posts, relate to possible ranges for the impact of changes to the staffing schedules and the effectiveness of redeployment.  The net pay allocation for teachers' salaries and pensions will increase by almost €300m in 2009 as a result of a combination of pay increases, increased pension costs, increased enrolment in 2009 and the full year costs of the salaries of extra teachers appointed in September 2008.An additional €40m has also been allocated for the continued growth in the provision for special needs in primary and post-primary schools providing for the full year costs of additional Special Needs Assistants in the system this September as well as provision for additional posts next September.

However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	965	I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 and 279 together.The National Disability Strategy supports and reinforces equal participation in society of people with disabilities.  Its elements include — the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, the Disability Act, 2005 and its associated Sectoral Plans published in 2006 by six Government Departments, the Citizens Information Act, 2007 and a commitment to a multi-annual investment programme for disability support services.The Deputy will be aware that although my Department does not have a Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, appropriate education services are supported as a central element in the Government commitment to supporting those with special educational needs/disability.This support is provided across a wide spectrum of initiatives within the education sector.  At school level, in addition to the teachers provided in the classroom, significant additional supports are also provided to enable schools to cater for the needs of students with special educational needs.  Such supports include additional resource teaching support, special needs assistant support, special transport arrangements, enhanced capitation and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.When the overall annual spend in 2008 to support persons with special educational needs is considered, including the €25m funding available under the multi-annual investment programme, my Department will spend an estimated €900m in total by the end of this year.The equivalent spend for 2006 and 2007 are €706m (€11m available under the multi-annual programme) and €838m (€20m available under the multi-annual programme) respectively.Following the announcement of Budget 2009, I am pleased to report that in excess of €1 billion will be available next year to support children and adults with special educational needs.With these levels of investment, it is clear that significant progress has been made in educational provision for people with special needs in recent years.  This progress has been achieved through the additional investments made by successive Ministers for Education.  Advances in the level of dedicated provision to support children with special educational needs include:Schools are now allocated extra resource teachers and special needs assistants to enable them meet the special educational needs of students. In the region of 19,000 staff in our schools work solely with children with special needs.Special Needs Assistant posts have increased from under 300 in 1997 to almost 10,000 in 2008.Primary schools are staffed up-front with additional teachers to cater for the most prevalent special educational needs — removing the need for assessments and delays in recruitment.The level of training available to teachers has improved significantly. The establishment of the Special Education Support Service to provide expert support, professional development and training opportunities in special education for school staff has been very significant.  In 2007, the service was in contact with over 15,000 teachers.  The range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to professionals in the special needs area has also significantly expanded.The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) aims to facilitate, for all students, the development of their potential and maximise the benefits of their educational and other experiences, having particular regard to those with special educational needs.  NEPS supports schools and students in the development and delivery of appropriate interventions for children with special educational needs.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was established to co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special needs.  The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  This has completely transformed the application process for extra supports for the better.Assistive technology, specialist equipment and building adaptations continue to be provided as necessary.  Special school transport arrangements, currently costing €50m per year, will continue to be made.There has been a particular focus in recent years on improving services for children with autism.  In the past year alone, about 100 extra special classes for autistic children have been set up, bringing the total number sanctioned to over 330 classes, andEarly educational intervention is now provided for children with autism from 2½ years of age.  There are now 35 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by my Department.  Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism aged from 2 ½ years to 5 who are unable to access an early intervention class.As announced on Budget day, in the current financial circumstances it is not possible to proceed with full implementation of the EPSEN Act in 2010 as originally envisaged.  Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.I am particularly pleased that, in order to strengthen and enhance services, and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date, the Government provided €20m in 2009 — €10m for education services and €10m for health services.In my Department this additional funding will provide for an expansion of the NEPS service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service as well as enhancing the capacity of the NCSE to co-ordinate the provision of services to children with special educational needs.  In addition teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs and there will be further investment in teacher training in this area.An integrated approach is being adopted by the education and health sectors to target these additional resources to the areas of greatest need.  Progress in both sectors will be kept under review by the Office for Disability & Mental Health and the Cross-Sectoral Team during 2009.
