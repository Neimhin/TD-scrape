          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I am glad to note the Government accepted our offer of waiving ordinary Taoiseach's Question Time to deal with this matter.  I will not play petty politics with an issue of fundamental importance to the Irish economy.  I am deeply concerned about what has happened since an illegal substance found its way into the human food chain.  I note the European Union has turned down the Government's request for compensation for processors to get the pork and bacon industry back in full swing and products back on the shelves of retail outlets here and abroad.  The Taoiseach is aware that pig farmers are among the most regulated in any agri sector and are required to have specific housing, temperature control, breeds of animals and concentrate feed to get the best product.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">This is not their fault or the fault of the processor.  It is critical that the industry be allowed to return to work.  What is the Government's response to the refusal of the European Union to allow for a compensation package for processors who are not bluffing on this occasion and who simply cannot meet the financial pressure of disposing of stock already <i>in situ</i>?</p>
          <p eId="para_8">Information received an hour ago on the results from cattle slaughtered showed that of a total of 3,000 slaughtered, eight of 11 herds are clear and three are above the legal limit for PCBs in beef.  This has significant implications.  How does the Government propose to deal with the situation where a product recall is not envisaged?  How will confidence be restored for consumers at home and abroad in two fundamentally important issues for the Irish economy?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_9">The results from samples taken from 11 of the 35 restricted herds do not have significant implications.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is satisfied that while there was technical non-compliance in three herds, eight were clear.  The level of increased levels of PCBs over proposed levels in beef does represent a risk to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">There is no reason for a product recall of beef because the number of cattle in the herds identified as having used the feed is less than 0.08% of the total herd, which is less than one tenth of 1%.  The reassurance given by the director of public health and the chief medical officer in the Department of Health and Children confirms there are no such implications.  It is important that we listen to the facts and scientific advice and take proportionate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Regarding the pork situation, Deputy Kenny suggested support was turned down.  That is not correct.  An official from the European Commission has outlined its position.  We are in discussion with processors to devise the parameters of a general scheme which will be submitted to the European Union.  I am confident that private storage will receive assistance.  We will make the case for other aspects of the scheme to help processors once this is agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The purpose of the discussion, which has been ongoing since yesterday evening, is to assess the level of product to be turned and then to work from that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">As the Food Safety Authority of Ireland deputy chief executive said today at a press conference that has just ended, we are awaiting the risk analysis results of the European Food Safety Authority on the secondary products between the gate and the market which are still at the distribution points and are still in storage.  Those results are expected this evening or tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">We want to make sure that the steps taken on Saturday to recall all pork products were based on the analysis of known facts and on the advice of the competent authorities, including the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children, and the chief veterinary officer of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The analysis and the advice reflected the high levels of contamination detected; the difficulty, if not impossibility, of separating meat from the ten production units concerned from the rest of the output of the relevant processing plants; the need to secure confidence in Irish food and the stringency of the control and regulatory arrangements that underpin food quality here; and the likelihood that in the absence of a recall, importation bans would be applied by individual countries or by the European Union.  The public health aspect of this relates to the effects of the cumulative consumption of dioxins, rather than any immediate consequences of the specific consumption of dioxins.  That has been explained by the medical officers concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The priority now must be to seek to resume the processing of pork and its immediate restoration to the markets.  Half of the output is consumed domestically and 80% of the rest is exported to the UK.  That must reflect the focus of marketing and other efforts when production resumes, as we hope it can.  The resumption of processing is essential to the 400 pig producers, given the rapid accumulation of animals and the welfare issues which would arise in the absence of an outlet for them.  We are in discussions with processors on their position.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">The Taoiseach should be grateful that I have not taken a narrow political line on a matter as important as this.  I am not talking about the reassurances given by the health officials, because I respect their expertise and their professionalism in this matter.  I am talking about consumer confidence.  As Minister of State for trade many years ago, I recall having to deal with some aspects of this, and it is incredibly difficult to have confidence restored when something is damaged.  The Taoiseach will recall the difficulties we had with exporting beef to Egypt, and these problems were not sorted out by politics, but science.  We had to prove beyond yay or nay that the product was first class and that we could stand over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I am concerned to hear the Taoiseach talk about devising the parameters of a scheme for submission to the European Union.  Have I been incorrectly informed that the EU has ruled out a compensation package for processors here?  Has that been confirmed to the Taoiseach?  What does he mean when he talks about discussing the parameters of a scheme to get the industry back processing?  He is aware that pigs are in the line and that the system cannot wait because the cycle is so short.  These processors need to get back to work now.  They cannot do that due to the financial pressure that is on them.  If they are to resume processing following what the Taoiseach calls the analysis of the parameters of a scheme, how long will that take?  Is the scheme ready in the Department?  When does the Taoiseach propose to take this to the European Union for its consent?  When can he deal with the allegation that the EU has ruled out a compensation package?  When can the processors expect to get back to processing pigs?</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Is the Taoiseach happy that the Government and the Department have been fully in compliance with the requirements of European rules and regulations on notification?  I made reference to the Government's response to the discovery of dioxins in pork.  I accept the statement issued by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, in which the authority's medical experts confirmed that there is no risk to public health from beef.  They have said that this is consistent with the precautionary approach taken to date.  Is the Taoiseach happy that the approach and the response are consistent?  Is he happy that the Government's approach will restore confidence to consumers?  We are aware that Bord Bia's marketing budget for next year has been cut.  I assure the Taoiseach, on the basis of my personal experience, that it is incredibly difficult to restore confidence among people in other countries after it has been damaged.  International damage was done in our case.  I can testify that bacon products from Great Britain and Denmark were available on shelves throughout the west yesterday.  The Government faces a real crisis in dealing with that lack of confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">How does the Government propose to deal with the crisis in the pork and bacon sector?  What resources will it give to Bord Bia to remarket our pork and beef products, of which we have all been proud over the years, in other countries?  How does the Government expect to restore consumer confidence in these two critical products, which are of such importance?  I would like the Taoiseach to respond to these questions as generously as he can.  I ask him to confirm that he is fully satisfied that the Government and the Department have been absolutely compliant with EU notification and information requirements.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_20">I will certainly reply as factually as I possibly can.  In no way is the purpose of these discussions to erode confidence in the products mentioned by the Deputy.  The precautionary principle, which is being applied in the pork and beef situations, is the proper principle to apply in the interests of maintaining confidence in Irish products.  A decision was taken on foot of the facts as they had been scientifically established and the advice given by the requisite authorities on the action to be taken.  In the case of pork, discussions with processors are continuing as we try to get processing up and running as quickly as possible.  It is important that we do that for the industry.  We are in discussions with the European Union, obviously.  The Minister will talk to the Commissioner, Ms Fischer Boel, at 5 p.m. today.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">When I was asked last night to give an update on the discussions with the processing industry, I indicated the areas of the schemes we were talking about.  We are discussing how to purchase, how to take the products that have been recalled off the market, how to provide a means by which processors can proceed with their activities and how to deal with the requirement to deal with animals that are still in the restricted units.  It is obvious that they will have to be disposed of and there is a need to proceed with that.  There is also the question of aids to private storage.  That will be a very good marketing support mechanism, obviously.  When slaughtering resumes, some stock will have to be put in storage pending the normalisation of the market over the coming weeks and months, which is the fervent hope of the industry.  The discussions are ongoing.  As I said when I replied to the Deputy's initial question, which contained a sort of definitive suggestion that our request had been turned down, we are in the process of devising the scheme that will form the basis for the discussions between the Commissioner, Ms Fischer Boel, and the Minister.  The provision of aids to private storage is an aspect of this matter that should get support.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">The Deputy referred to precedent when he raised the possibility of direct aid from the State being regarded as a state aid to the industry during this emergency situation.  It is obvious that the EU needs to understand our case. That is the aspect in which the EU needs to be involved.  We have also kept it involved from the regulatory point of view as the Deputy has suggested in terms of anything that was coming up.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">It is important to point out that from the time when the indicative test of a sample of pork fat, which was routinely taken under the Department's national residue monitoring programme, was found to be positive for the presence of contamination, we have seen the daily work that was taken by the Department as a result of that to the point where we finally had confirmation of the presence of dioxins in pork samples at 3.40 p.m. on Saturday.  Everything was done as one would expect.  The Deputy will know from previous unfortunate experience we had in the past with BSE, for example, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is quite expert in this area and its ability to deal with that competently is well understood.  I believe the same applies here in respect of the detection taken, the dealing with it comprehensively and in a proper fashion and with the right notifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The other point the Deputy made was on what is to be done about restoring confidence in the marketplace.  Of course we will do everything we possibly can.  If one looks at the pork industry, 50% is for home consumption.  Of the other 50%, some 80% goes to the UK.  Taking those together, Britain and Ireland represent the ultimate location of 90% of the pork.  We will work very hard with the industry and with major customers to provide all the assurance we can, using the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, our attachés in various markets and the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassies in whatever way we can to ensure there is an accurate understanding by everybody of what has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The reason for the product recall was to avoid a situation where bans would be imposed, which would mean we would be chasing the issue rather than dealing with it, as we are now.  That has been welcomed by both colleagues in EU member state governments and people in other parts of the world for the proactive nature of what we have been trying to achieve.  It has brought a serious problem for our own industry here in terms of the pork business and the processing business, and we are in the process of trying to deal with that as we speak.  Those discussions continue with a view to trying to see if we can bring them to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_26">I watched the press conference just given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I was relieved to hear him state it will not be necessary to withdraw beef products based on the examination that been done of 11 of the herds that have been inspected.  However, we still have a major problem with pork.  I agree with the comments that have been made that the critical issue to all this now is consumer confidence.  When I went to my local food market yesterday evening, the shelves where the rashers and sausages used to be were bare and there was a big black notice explaining why.  As long as the pork products are not on the shelf, consumer confidence will continue to diminish.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Three things are critical and urgent.  First, we need to get pork products back on the shelves again.  Second, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food needs to make a clear statement that it is safe to purchase and consume pork again.  Third, that statement needs to be backed up by a similar statement by the European Commissioner.  Can the Taoiseach tell us when pork products will be back on the supermarket shelves?  When will the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food be in a position to give the assurance to our domestic consumers and consumers abroad that Irish pork is safe to purchase and consume?  There is not much point in having our diplomatic service and our food promotion agencies working night and day to promote Irish pork products if the pork products are not available to be purchased.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">I remember the BSE crisis, which arose because of a problem with the foodstuff fed to cattle.  I was a little surprised that this problem arose, again, from a problem with the foodstuff fed to livestock and which is, therefore, entering the food chain.  I was doubly surprised to read that the feed plant at the centre of this issue had not been inspected for a year.  Is it true no inspection was done on the Bunclody plant for a year?  Even if it had been inspected by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the problem might not have been identified because the problem with the fuel does not come under the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but is in the EPA's remit.  Is there an inter-agency problem?</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I was also surprised that a report in one of today's newspapers said the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food explained this on the grounds that it was low risk.  We are about to pay a very high price for the low-risk approach that was being taken to the inspection of this foodstuff recycling plant.  I would like some explanation of what inspections were carried out and if the results of the last inspections will be published or made available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_30">The Deputy is correct that we want pork products back on the shelves as quickly as possible.  An assurance can be given that, post-recall, all Irish pork products on shelves at home and abroad will be proper and appropriate products.  Those ten production units on the nine farms identified as being in receipt of the contaminated feed are restricted and no product from those farms will find its way onto the food market.  It is correct to say that as soon as we can get processing back up and running we will be able to give that guarantee.  That is the reason the discussions we are having are so urgent and are ongoing.  That assurance can be given.  The source of the contamination, the feed, and the pork fat which was contaminated as a result, will not come on the market because of the restriction on the units concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">The place that manufactured this dough, which was fed into a composition of a crumb that was part of the feed of pigs and cattle on the 38 units, 45 herds of which are being examined, was inspected in 2007.  It was an annual inspection.  The EPA would deal with the question of the oil.  The manufacturer was obliged to use suitable oil for that purpose.  It is clear at this stage of the investigation that it was an unsuitable oil product and this seems to be the source of the contamination.  The FSAI has said that is the likely source, and those investigations continue.  The owners are being spoken to about that to get to the bottom of it.  The oil should not have been used by the owners of the plant.  It has had this outcome.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the FSAI have reacted to that and we are in this position as a result of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_32">The Taoiseach says the owners of the Bunclody plant are being spoken to in an effort to get to the bottom of it.  Has the Taoiseach got to the bottom of it?  Does the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food know exactly what happened here?  When can a statement be made setting out what caused the problem?</p>
          <p eId="para_33">With regard to the return of pork products to the market, I understand discussions with the processors are ongoing.  Does the Taoiseach agree that with every passing day and hour that pork products are not back on sale, consumer confidence both here and abroad is being diminished?  There is an urgency about getting pork products back on the shelf not only to restore consumer confidence, but to secure the industry and people's jobs by getting things moving again.  The longer this is delayed, the more damage will be done.  We understand that what happened happened.  There will be time to go back over what happened in Bunclody.  Action had to be taken to recall the products, but I am not seeing a sense of urgency — although I do not want to be critical in this regard — about getting the product moving again.  I would like to offer the Taoiseach a second opportunity to give the House an indication of when we are likely to see pork products back on the supermarket shelf.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_34">Of course there is an urgency to this, but it is also necessary to show a degree of calm and demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the Government's response as a means of bolstering confidence.  We should not project beyond the scientific facts of the situation, because people will start to add two and two and get six, and that is not a good thing, particularly when one is talking about consumer confidence.  I have been anxious, from the time this came before us for a decision, to establish the facts, take the relevant advice and decide the action to be taken based on that advice.  That is what we have done throughout this process in order to ensure clarity and prevent a fog of confusion from building up around the matter.  People often head off on tangents that lead them away from the central issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">The central issue is that we have identified the source of the contamination and the units that received the feed.  We have restricted those herds from going into the food chain.  We then had to apply the precautionary principle with regard to the products that were already on the market.  A product recall was carried out.  Confirmation was given that there was no risk to public health.  This was verified by the Food Safety Authority and the Department of Health and Children.  People may take strong reassurance from all these facts, which have been communicated.  Everyone, including the media, is to be thanked for the responsible way in which this matter was reported and communicated to the public, because this is important.  I acknowledge that and I am grateful for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">With regard to the cattle herds affected — the number is now 45, as has been explained by Mr. Rogan — it must be worked out from the database whether any of these cattle has gone from one herd to another.  Mr. Rogan explained the reasoning behind this at the press conference.  Again, there is an emphasis on a comprehensive approach and zero tolerance of any suggestion of contamination.  The swiftness of these actions and the comprehensiveness of the approach has been recorded and responded to internationally, and this has won us support in places whose markets we wish to retain.  These are important considerations.  Had we not taken that approach, unilateral decisions would have been taken by individual EU member states and other states regarding the banning of pork products, with all the difficulties that would entail.  Thus, markets remain open on the basis that we issued a product recall.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Deputy Gilmore also mentioned the need for urgency in getting the matter resolved on the processing side.  We are now dealing with secondary processors and the risk analysis by the European Food Safety Authority.  The authority will come to a conclusion on the matter either this evening or tomorrow and will, it is to be hoped, verify the safety of a range of products that are not yet on the market, but are in the process of going to market.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The issue of contingent liability is an important matter about which processors might be worried.  This is one of the considerations being dealt with in the discussions.  We are trying to put in place a scheme with three simple elements.  These are first, the question of destroying those herds, either beef herds or pig herds, which have been contaminated.  Second, dealing with the issue of secondary processing through the risk analysis procedure of the EU which will give immediate scientific clarification of a range of products which are regarded as being non-problematic, safe and marketable.  This would be important in terms of third, ensuring we get to the position of restoring activity in processing plants, achieving the necessary throughput into the production line as pigs become available and ready for slaughter, and onto the shelves in a matter of days, very soon thereafter.  These are the three areas of activity in which we are engaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and colleagues and all the State employees.  There has been a lot of talk in other contexts about the public service.  I thank public servants for their expertise, for the clarity of the advice we are receiving and for their ability to implement those advices once the decisions have been taken by the requisite Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">I have been engaged on this matter from last Saturday afternoon when the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, informed me about the situation on Friday evening coming back from Brussels.  Since Saturday afternoon we have been on top of this situation to the greatest possible extent.  I am also grateful to Members of the House who have shown reticence and responsibility in the interests of accurate information being made available to the public so that we can overcome this real challenge to important aspects of our food industry which employs many people, some of whom are personally known to me.  I am anxious to restore that employment in those processing plants as soon as is possible and feasible.  Those discussions are ongoing.  I can assure the House that I regard this as a matter of the utmost urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I am giving the Taoiseach notice that I will not be accepting a guillotine later this week on the Health Bill 2008, the legislation to withdraw medical cards from persons over 70 years of age.  This is an issue on which many Members will want to speak.  I am advising the Chief Whip of that in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Up to ten reports have been laid before the Dáil by the Chairmen of the Oireachtas Committees on European Scrutiny and European Affairs.  In view of the importance of these reports, will the Taoiseach consult with the Government Whip on setting aside time at some appropriate occasion for a decent debate on them?</p>
          <p eId="para_56">In light of what Deputy Charles Flanagan raised, can the shocking tragedy of a young child allegedly taking the life of an innocent man on the streets of Dublin be the subject of a response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  Obviously that cannot take place today but perhaps tomorrow or Thursday.  This issue has sunk to a tragic low and is redeemable in the sense of dealing with those social dysfunctions and tragedies that occur where innocent life has been lost.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_21">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_58">The Gas (Amendment) Bill is on Report Stage, which could be taken next week perhaps.  I am not sure but it is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">The shooting in East Wall on Sunday night is a deeply disturbing development.  Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mr. O'Kane and the local community.  What makes it deeply disturbing is the apparent youth of the people involved.  The Garda Síochána is carrying out a full investigation into the circumstances of this tragic death and I do not want to say anything that impinges on the investigation.  A number of persons are in Garda custody.  We will seek to learn whatever lessons there may be in these tragic circumstances.  The important thing in the short term is that those responsible, whatever their ages, are brought to justice.  I understand the Garda investigation is making steady progress.  It may be possible, through a private notice question or an Adjournment debate, for the matter to be taken on another day if the Ceann Comhairle so decides.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">We have made a commitment that we can have a debate each month on the report Deputy Kenny mentioned.  While I note what Deputy Kenny has to say on the health Bill, it is important from the Government's point of view and in the interest of certainty and the clarity of the situation to have the matter enacted before the Dáil rises this term.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_22">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_61">I agree with Deputy Kenny.  The Labour Party will not agree to the guillotining of the Bill, which is being introduced here to take the medical card from pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">I join Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach in expressing sympathy to the family and friends of the victim of the awful shooting in East Wall, Mr. O'Kane.  I appreciate that the Garda investigation is under way.  No one here wishes to say anything to compromise that or a subsequent trial, but elements of this case suggest that anti-social behaviour has morphed into violent gun crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">The programme for Government contains a number of specific commitments in respect of anti-social behaviour.  We were to get a regime where stay away orders were to be introduced, banning orders that could ban people from particular areas, new provisions in respect of parental responsibility and anti-social behaviour teams established.  Nothing has been done about any of these promises made in the programme for Government.  Six or seven criminal justice Bills are listed for publication and it would be helpful if the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could say something about what is happening to the commitments the Government gave about strengthening measures to deal with anti-social behaviour in the programme for Government and whether these will see the light of day.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_23">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_64">A number of important criminal justice issues have been brought forward by the Administration and I am sure there are more to come to try to deal with the problems that are arising in modern society.  On the question of anti-social behaviour and anti-social behaviour orders, the legislation requires that a sequence must be followed before one can be issued.  This involves formal warnings being issued before an order comes into play and additional steps in the case of children.  I understand that, up to the end of October, 907 warnings were issued to adults and 548 to children under the legislation.  In addition, 12 behaviour contracts have been entered into for children.  Where it is necessary for gardaí to seek behaviour orders, they have done so and three have been obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">We must be realistic about what such orders can achieve.  They were never intended to nor can they address, unfortunately, the problem of gun crime.  The point is taken that we must continue to review to the greatest extent we can to maximise effectiveness within the resources available.  The Minister has spoken out strongly against a growing gun culture in our society and he has indicated his intentions in that respect regarding the question of handguns, etc.  While there is no room to be complacent and there is always room to listen to ideas as to how the situation can be improved, that would be an accurate assessment of the up-to-date situation.</p>

        <heading>Recall of Irish Pork and Bacon Products: Statements. </heading>
        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_52">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_105">I am glad to have the opportunity to make a comprehensive statement relating to the circumstances that led to the weekend's recall of all Irish pork and bacon products and the developments since then.  The focus of my statement will primarily be on the role of my Department, while my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Wallace, will focus principally on the public health issues and the involvement of the Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Like the Taoiseach, I compliment various Members on their contributions on the national airwaves over the weekend regarding this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The incident, which resulted in the confirmed presence of dioxins in pork fat, first came to light on Friday, 28 November, when a routine sample of pork fat, taken as part of my Department's national residue monitoring programme was shown to be positive for the presence of non-dioxin-like marker PCBs.  The Department moved swiftly in response to this test result to identify the source and scale of the contamination and to contain the incident.  Additional samples of pork as well as samples of feed were analysed and the original pork fat sample was sent to the Central Science Laboratory in York for further analysis for the presence of dioxins.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Having determined that the source of the contamination was a feed ingredient, library feed samples were taken from the feed manufacture's facility and the farms to which the contaminated feed was sent were traced and placed under movement restriction.  Since then, farm to farm movements from these farms have been traced and a number of additional farms have now been placed under restriction.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">At 3.40 p.m. on Saturday, 6 September, the Central Science Laboratory in York confirmed the presence of dioxins in the pork fat samples and the decision was taken immediately that all Irish pork products from pigs slaughtered since 1 September should be recalled.  The 1 September date was chosen on the basis of the evidence available to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  In the first instance, an analysis of the dioxins demonstrated that the exposure of the pigs was recent and therefore 1 September was identified as a reasonable precautionary date.  The analysis of the feed samples taken from the feed manufacturer for the presence of PCBs supported this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">Significantly, following the publication by the Department of a press release on Thursday, 4 December confirming an investigation into the source of a contaminant in animal feed and the restriction of a number of farms, the Dutch authorities contacted the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland with regard to their own independent investigation into the presence of PCBs in pork fat samples, the origin of which they had been unable to determine, although Ireland was one of the countries from which product was sourced.  These investigations indicated an increase in dioxin levels in mid-September, further strengthening the case for a 1 September date.  It is important to stress that at no point was the Department responding to information provided from other member states and we were contacted only after we put information in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The decision to have a full recall of pork and bacon was taken to reassure consumers that Irish pork and bacon products available on the market following the recall would be perfectly safe to consume.  I am entirely satisfied this was the appropriate response to the confirmed presence of dioxins and I believe that it will provide the necessary reassurance to consumers as soon as Irish pork products reappear on shop shelves, which it is hoped will happen in the coming days.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">The national control plan for Ireland, which is approved by the European Commission, covers all the controls in animal health and welfare, food safety and feeding stuffs controls.  Under this plan, the Department operates the national residue monitoring programme and the national feed inspection programme.  The national residue monitoring programme involves a risk-based sampling regime, where upwards of 30,000 samples are taken from animal tissues at farm and primary processing levels.  These samples are tested for a broad range of residues including banned hormones, authorised medicines and a large number of contaminants.  The feed inspection programme involves approximately 2,200 inspections per annum throughout the feed chain.  The inspections cover a range of areas, including imports, mills, mineral mixture plants, retailers of animal feed as well as farms.  The level of inspections carried out complies with and, in many cases, exceeds the requirements of EU legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The premises from which the contaminated feed originated is one of 45 registered food business operators.  Very few problems have been found in such premises previously and, as such, they are regarded as low-risk and subject to one or two inspections annually.  The premises in question was inspected in 2006 and 2007 and was scheduled for an inspection in late November or December 2008, which had not yet taken place.  Ireland's national residue monitoring and national feed inspection programmes are audited by the EU's Food and Veterinary Office and the most recent audit of the national feed inspection programme took place in May this year and the subsequent report reflected very favourably on Ireland's testing regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The Department's ongoing investigation into the source of the contamination has centred on a single food business operator and is being assisted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Garda Síochána.  The particular focus of the investigation relates to the type of fuel used in a burner which heats surplus food material for use as animal feed.  This process is regarded as relatively simple.  Preliminary test results on samples of the oil taken by the Department for analysis suggest that the operator may have been using an inappropriate kind of oil for this process.  Further investigations are being undertaken by the EPA on the oil used.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">In the meantime, the farms placed under restriction remain under restriction and no animals have been allowed to move off these farms.  I am acutely conscious of the particular difficulties that the absence of any processing is causing for pig producers, many of whom I know have thousands of pigs ready for slaughter this week.  The Government is particularly anxious that processing recommence as soon as possible and is particularly conscious of the impact on the thousands of workers employed at pig producing plants throughout the country as well as the many producers who are anxious to move animals for slaughter.  It is in everybody's interest that slaughtering recommences quickly and that we get back into the market, restore consumer confidence and protect what is a vital element in the wider Irish agrifood sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">To this end, the Taoiseach and I, along with officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, have been engaged in constructive discussions with representatives of the processing sector and producers with a view to putting in place a financial aid package that would facilitate the early resumption of processing.  These discussions are continuing and progress is being made and I remain optimistic that we can reach agreement that will ensure that slaughtering resumes this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">I know there has been anxiety surrounding the outcome of analysis on samples taken from a representative sample of 11 of the 45 cattle herds under restriction.  Preliminary results became available from my Department's central veterinary research laboratory last night and have been assessed overnight by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The outcome of this assessment is now available and I am extremely pleased with the results.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">This afternoon, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland confirmed that the results for marker PCBs are such that it is satisfied there is no public health concern.  Of the 11 herds, eight were clear and the remaining three, although technically non-compliant, are not at a level to pose any public health concern.  The levels found were significantly less than those found in the pigs last week.  We will maintain our precautionary approach and a number of proportionate measures will be taken to provide further reassurance as follows.  Any animals or herds shown to be above the proposed legal limit will be taken out of the food and feed chain.  Any product from these herds will not be released into the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The European Commission is being informed of the results and testing of the remaining herds is continuing.  The results received to date are such that the measures set out above are sufficient.  On the advice of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, there will be no product recall as there was in the case of pork and bacon products.  I am pleased and relieved at today's results and I have directed Bord Bia, other State agencies and our embassies worldwide to ensure this positive message is conveyed and the world-class product we have is promoted aggressively at home and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Obviously, the confirmation of the presence of dioxins in pork and today's results from the beef samples are a major disappointment for this House, the industry and our country.  We have a responsibility as a Government to act to protect public health, provide consumer confidence and to safeguard a vital industry.  This requires a balanced and proportionate response.  I am satisfied that we have acted swiftly, decisively and responsibly.  I am confident, based on the expertise and advice provided by the Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland that the actions taken do not in any way compromise public health.  Rather, they will provide consumer assurance and, with the assistance of a new Bord Bia labelling system, Irish pork and bacon products will be back on the shelves quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The measures we have taken are an indication of our commitment to the public health of our citizens and to the reputation of our agrifood sector.  We have, at all times, acted responsibly and proportionately.  I am optimistic that the negotiations with processing and producer interests will deliver an outcome that facilitates the resumption of slaughtering as a matter or urgency, in the interests of the thousands of employees, producers and processors and, not least, in the national interest.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryWallace" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_53">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Mary Wallace)</from>
          <p eId="para_121">I welcome the reassuring confirmation given by Mr. Alan Reilly of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, at this afternoon's press briefing that there is no risk to public health from beef.  Nevertheless, consistent with the precautionary approach taken to date and to provide reassurance to consumers, the following actions are being taken: any animals in herds shown to be above the proposed legal limit will be taken out of the food and feed chain, any product from these herds will not be released onto the market and the European Commission is being informed of the results.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">On Saturday, 6 December, following the confirmation of the presence of dioxins in some Irish pork products, the FSAI required the food industry to recall all such products from the market as a precautionary measure.  As Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion and food safety, my priority is public health.  Although the health risks for people exposed in the short term to dioxins do not provide cause for concern, the potential effects of continued high cumulative exposure over time led to the precautionary withdrawal of pork products from the market.  The high levels of dioxins, between 80 and 200 times the legal limit, found in the pork products necessitated such a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">I have been advised by both the chief medical officer, CMO, of the Department of Health and Children and the FSAI that scientific data and evidence do not support concerns on the health of people exposed to dioxins over a short period.  The CMO has issued clear advice on this issue to the public and to general practitioners in correspondence.  The advice is that Irish pork products produced between 1 September 2008 and 7 December should not be consumed; that any risk arising to health from the consumption of Irish pork products prior to the product recall is extremely low; that there is no need for people to seek direct medical advice; that it is not expected that the exposure in this incident will result in symptoms; and that the recall of pork products was to avoid cumulative exposure over a prolonged period which could lead to a harmful build-up of dioxin in the body.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">An expert group has been convened by the FSAI to provide advice to the CMO on toxicological and medical issues.  This group is also engaged in ongoing consultation with the European Food Safety Authority, the World Health Organisation and counterpart health risk assessors in the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency.  It is undertaking a risk assessment of maximum likely exposure levels and is drawing on the experience of the Belgian incident in 1999 where dioxin-contaminated feed was introduced onto chicken and pig farms.  The level of dioxin found in Belgian pig fat was similar to that reported in Ireland and the duration of exposure to contaminated produce in Belgium was slightly longer.  No adverse health effects have been reported in the Belgian population, with studies showing that the levels and duration of exposure were insufficient to increase the dioxin levels in the body.  The expert group is meeting regularly to monitor the current situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">To allay any public fears, the FSAI has opened an advice line, published a questions and answers sheet on its website and issued a series of press releases aimed at providing up-to-date information to both consumers and industry.  The FSAI has also issued instructions to assist environmental health officers, who have been working since the weekend with retail outlets on the withdrawal of unsafe products.  The Irish authorities' actions have been validated by the favourable international response.  The French Agriculture Minister, Michel Barnier, has welcomed Ireland's actions, stating that we "reacted very rapidly".  Ms Androulla Vassiliou, the European Commissioner for Health, has expressed satisfaction with Ireland's actions and has indicated that no further action is required by the Commission.  The European Commission is satisfied that Ireland has acted in a correct manner.  Likewise, industry representatives have welcomed the quick response from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Analysis of the situation is ongoing.  This evaluation process must be completed to ensure that all affected product is identified and restricted before post-recall product can be placed on the market.  Furthermore, robust arrangements must be put in place to underpin and facilitate the release process.  These steps are fundamental in terms of protecting public health and retaining consumer confidence in Irish pork products.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Notwithstanding the extremely low risk to public health, the prompt action taken by the Irish authorities in initiating a recall will ultimately protect Ireland's hard won reputation as a world class producer of safe and high-quality foods.  I join with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Taoiseach in thanking all the experts for the clarity of their advice and their hard work at the weekend.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_54">
          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_128">Notwithstanding the enormous economic impact of the crisis in which we are currently engulfed, it is important to emphasise that it is, first and foremost, a public health issue and, thus, an issue of consumer confidence.  As a lay person, I am reassured by the comments I have heard from eminent scientists, including the former chief executive of the FSAI, Dr. Patrick Wall, deputy chief executive officer of the FSAI, Mr. Alan Reilly, and Mr. Houlihan, the CMO at the Department of Health and Children.  That reassurance is important to the public because therein lie the foundations on which we can rebuild confidence in the industry.  Through that, we can rebuild the markets which are undoubtedly closing to us as this crisis evolves.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">In the context of that expert advice, it is important that we do not hide our light under a bushel.  The State, whether through the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Health and Children, the FSAI or a combination of all three, should be proactive in taking out radio and television advertisements and public press notices in an effort to reassure the public that the Irish food industry is open for business and that our products are safe.  This is critical to the task of re-establishing confidence, which, in turn, is critical to the re-establishment of the pork market, of which the domestic market is a significant element.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">It is inadequate merely to extrapolate from the Belgian experience and conclude, on that basis, that all is well for the Irish consumer.  It is important that we have quantitative research so that we can reassure the public on that basis.  Available advice indicates that it should be possible to get that quantitative research into the public domain within a short period of time and thus further add to the incremental process of confidence rebuilding that is imperative if we are to come out of this difficult economic situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Those who are part of the pig industry in its broadest sense, whether primary producers, processors and their many employees or those affected by the ripple effect into other food sectors, are innocent victims of this development.  While a plant in County Carlow may be the source of contamination that has brought the pig industry to its knees, it is patently obvious that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, through its failure to monitor adequately this premises, has led us to this situation.  It beggars belief that such a facility can, in the words of the Department, be considered "low risk" when the food chain was central to our last major food scare in the 1990s, after which a range of new regulations was introduced in 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">I am not interested in a blame game between the Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Neither are producers and consumers.  What they want is accountability in respect of the systems failure that gave rise to the situation in which we find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">These new regulations, coupled with previous global incidents of contamination in the food chain with PCBs, namely, the Brazilian citrus pulp crisis and the Belgian crisis of 1999, clearly point to a systems failure in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It only adds to the abject failure within the Department to state that even if this facility had been subject to greater scrutiny by the Department the appropriate test for dioxin in the food product would not have been conducted because the cost of dioxin tests is in excess of €1,000 each.  It should be pointed out that no scrutiny of this facility had taken place in 2008 and there was only one visit in each of the years 2007 and 2006, notwithstanding the lessons we should have learned from the Belgian crisis and the BSE crisis about the importance of the food chain.  Considering the enormous cost the State is now facing that is small change.  I am conscious that the meaning of "small change" was determined on the Government benches by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey's, reference to the €50 million cost of the e-voting machines.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The failure to detect this problem at source is compounded by the Department's subsequent failure to detect the problem on the individual farms that were supplied by this facility.  These farmers are innocent victims but the farms are licensed by the Department as they need a licence to blend their own compound feed.  There is a double layer of failure in the Department on this issue.  I appreciate that detailed investigations are ongoing but the bodies charged with regulatory and enforcement responsibility, including the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, must answer for how a product such as PCB oils, which has been banned from production since the mid-1970s, has turned up with such devastating consequences for the Irish food industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Farmers in all sectors, including the pig sector, have invested enormous amounts of time and money in a traceability system that has been shown not to work in the pig sector.  Otherwise, why should there be a 100% recall of product for a 10% incidence of contamination?  What will be the Minister's sales pitch now to farmers across all sectors who still invest in traceability?</p>
          <p eId="para_136">I note the recent announcement of the confirmation of PCBs in the beef sector.  Farmers were sold the idea that if there was a crisis in the food sector, traceability would ensure it would be possible to recall, selectively, the product that is contaminated.  Clearly, there is a system failure in the traceability system which will exercise the minds of the Minister and his senior officials in the days to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">To say farmers are angry about this systems failure is a gross understatement.  They are subject to the most stringent multiple unannounced inspections regime. They may not like it but they have worked with it on the basis that it safeguarded their livelihoods.  Their sense of betrayal and anger is palpable.  As an individual pig farmer said to me over the weekend, "This will not only finish my business, it will take my family home".  The pig sector is a capital intensive enterprise operating at minimum margins and has only been in profit for four of the last 18 months.  As a result of the systems failure in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, these farmers, their processors and thousands of ordinary working people face the prospect of the dole queue.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">Given the recent announcement by the Minister that PCBs above the legislative limits have been confirmed in the beef sector, the decision not to recall product raises serious questions about the proportionality of the response in the pig sector.  Since last Saturday, notwithstanding the decision to recall 100% of product, officials from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Department of Health and Children and others have been at pains to reassure those who have consumed pork products that there are no negative health consequences.  If that is the case, and given the decision not to recall beef products, which I support, because we are led to believe traceability is operative from farm to fork, I believe the Minister has questions to answer about his response in the pig sector.  I hope there will be an opportunity to tease this out in greater detail in subsequent questions to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The damage to our €9.2 billion food industry — accounting for 9.7% of exports and 8% of employment — and to consumer confidence at home and abroad is very significant.  Any analysis of the international news spin on this issue makes clear how our competitors will use this against us.  Against this background and following the budget, Bord Bia faces an 8% cut in funding.  In addition, it is being asked to take on the marketing duties originally carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Time is of the essence when dealing with this issue so I am anxious to hear from the Minister, before the end of this week, if not today, details of an additional funding arrangement for Bord Bia so it can immediately begin the fight back to reclaim markets that have been closed and operations to restore confidence both at home and abroad.  As I said earlier, the home market for the pork industry is very significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">In addition, a major political and diplomatic initiative will be required, in terms of contacts at the highest levels, including ambassadorial, ministerial and heads of state, in respect of the lucrative markets that have already been closed to us.  In the coming hours, intensive diplomatic manoeuvring and negotiating will also be required at EU level to ensure that market remains open to our products.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">This marketing initiative is of course predicated on the processors getting back into business.  I listened in anticipation last night for a conclusive statement that the Government had agreed a package with the industry that would enable it to get up and running today.  Now the Taoiseach is talking about negotiations in Europe about a framework.  The Minister is aware from experience in his constituency that animal welfare issues will quickly loom on individual pig farms.  Pigs that were due to be slaughtered today were to be replaced in the units by store pigs, which were moving along the conveyor chain.  Indeed, sows that are farrowing today are due to have their piglets moved up the line.  Pig production is a continuous conveyor belt.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">We need joined-up thinking.  What is required is diplomatic and political action and a marketing initiative from Bord Bia.  However, that will be useless if the processors are not back in business.  The Taoiseach's remarks about seeking funding from Europe on this issue had all the hallmarks of a kick to touch.  I wish him the best but this industry has been waiting for days to start processing, when so much hangs in the balance in respect of access to markets and employment.  The processors and their employees from Cavan to Cork and all points between need to get back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Another casualty in this situation is the organic and artisan food sector, which is dear to the Minister of State's heart.  Farmers in that sector have had no contact with any of the product that has been contaminated but they are affected by the 100% recall of product.  The proportionality of that recall is under question.  Producers who had no access to or contact with contaminated product should be given immediate clearance from the Department's veterinary service to get on with their business.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">A number of other issues were not addressed by the Minister.  One is the appropriate manner for disposing of the enormous volume of product that will be returned to the processors.  Yesterday, I called to a small artisan producer, whose cold room is already filled with produce that is now officially deemed to be waste.  It is being stored side by side with product that is fit for the market.  These processors are facing into the Christmas market and are desperate to get this product off their premises so they can get back to business as quickly as possible.  How will that waste be dealt with appropriately?  An extensive cull is required in the pig industry, covering all individual farms on which animals have been contaminated as a result of the contaminated feed.  How will this cull be carried out?  How will the animals be disposed of?  Will incineration or rendering be used?  The Minister did not provide information on this issue.  To address this problem in a comprehensive manner he must close the significant information gap.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Lest Deputies forget, consumers also have rights.  None of the Government's statements referred to consumers' entitlements to refunds.  The initial advice given to consumers crystallised the absence of forethought and planning in the ministerial announcement on Saturday.  The original advice was to dispose of all pork products.  We now find, however, that consumers are entitled to a refund at the point of purchase.  Consumer entitlements have been dealt with shoddily and treated as an afterthought.  The disposal of the returned products and the manner in which the cull will be carried out are critical issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I assure the Minister and his Government colleagues that they will receive total co-operation from the Fine Gael Party in protecting the interests of the agrifood sector.  We must also be assured, however, that in the days ahead the defects I have identified in respect of the Department's inspection regime will be remedied in order that we can have full confidence in its operation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_55">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_147">I will share time with Deputy Willie Penrose.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">I express solidarity with all pig producers in the organic and non-organic sector, craft butchers, processors and every worker who has been adversely affected by this crisis.  Public health and consumer confidence must be restored immediately.  This will be the indicator of the future viability of the pigmeat industry.  Producers have been unfairly plunged into a crisis which is not of their making.  Farms which purchased contaminated feed did so in good faith and on the basis that the product was licensed.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The pork industry is the fourth largest in the agriculture sector and is worth approximately €400 million per annum.  I understand exports of pigmeat were worth €212 million in 2007.  In that context, we must take cognisance of the fact that only ten of a possible 400 producers have been affected by contaminated feed.  I understand the producers in question produce less than 10% of the overall kill.  The minimal number of producers affected should help restore public confidence because if the figures I cite are correct, 90% of the pig kill is beyond reproach and scientific evidence will show that the risk to human health diminishes significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">We cannot underestimate the importance of the meat industry.  Having listened carefully to the Taoiseach and Minister, I note that neither of them referred to a timeline for the return of pork to the shelves.  I understood from the Taoiseach that the European Food Safety Authority must make this call from a scientific perspective.  I call on the authority and European Commission to make allowance for the importance of the meat industry to this State.  These institutions must act as soon as possible to ensure products are placed on the shelves again and public confidence restored.  If the European Union will not provide a compensation package, at least Commissioner Kuneva and the EFSA should issue a statement within 24 to 48 hours indicating that production can commence again.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">The true test of patriotism, if I may use that word, is to stand in solidarity on this issue.  We should not use it to score political points off the Minister.  We all know family farmers or workers in processing plants whose livelihoods depend on a viable pig and beef industry.  At the same time, however, fundamental questions must be asked of the Department.  I call on the Minister to act with greater urgency and to implore the European Commission to make a statement forthwith to enable the industry to start working again.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">While the Government was correct to introduce a total recall of pork products, if the problem affected less than 10% of producers and 90% of pork products are thereby deemed to be safe and fit for human consumption, the Minister should have made a statement in the 24 to 48 hour period following the total recall indicating that production could recommence.  He should clarify the reason this has not been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">If the traceability system was working adequately and the one-step-up, one-step-back principle was being adhered to, it would have been possible to isolate the relevant producers and stop their production.  This would have allowed other producers who never used this material to continue to provide product for the market.  This issue must also be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The national feed inspection programme is a rigorous regime applied to all primary producers, whether pig or beef farmers.  Everything which reaches the farm gate is subject to the most stringent inspection controls in the world.  Why did the inspection process for feedstuffs fail in respect of the producer in question?  The systems failure which occurred has significantly diminished the potential of the pig and pigmeat industry.  The sector will take a long time to claw its way back to its previous position.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">We need to show solidarity with all the players in the industry.  This is a national issue on which the Labour Party will support the Minister in every step of the process.  Nevertheless, the problem must be handled with a greater sense of urgency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_156">I was here in the late 1990s and the early 2000s when matters of great significance and national importance, the foot and mouth disease and BSE crises, arose.It is important we are constructive, put all shoulders to the wheel and act in solidarity to ensure the pivotal role of the agricultural industries is secured.  As a consumer I am reassured by what I am hearing, particularly regarding beef production.  I come from the heart of the beef producing area.  If anyone wants assurance, I intend to eat steak tomorrow and as a consumer myself that is the best assurance I can give.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The total recall of pork products and by-products at the weekend was of significant concern and showed that the Government acted quickly.  It is now a matter of major concern to pig producers and processors, butchers and employees in factories and on farms, and also involves suppliers and hauliers.  It is having significant adverse consequences across the country and affects up to 6,000 people.  I know some of them.  I am aware of lay-offs in Rosderra.  I know the owners of that plant and went to school with some of them.  There are 850 employees who have been laid off there indefinitely, and other lay-offs could bring the number under protective notice to 1,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">They will be unemployed for a period of time unless agreement is reached between the Minister and the industry on the nature and extent of an aid and rescue package.  There is an urgency to making progress in this regard.  There are 6,000 jobs in the pork industry.  I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me the level of progress made by the Government and his colleagues in the European Commission to try and secure a rescue package to ensure the survival of an industry which provides significant employment in rural areas.  This has been done over a number of years and is being done now.  It is very difficult to bring industry and jobs into a rural area and we cannot underestimate its importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I heard the announcement that three of the 11 herds have only twice the level of PCBs and it was reassuring.  I did not realise 45 farmers were involved; I thought there were only 30.  I know a significant number of farmers involved, and they were also involved in discussions on the foot and mouth disease and BSE when those crises erupted.  As far as I was aware, a comprehensive traceability system was to be put in place in 2002.  It was to apply across the food industry and was to be put in place with no ifs, buts or maybes.  A question now arises as to how the traceability and identification system fell at the very first hurdle.  It was a like a well-bred horse who comes onto a track and goes down the first time she is given a run.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">I recall debating this issue in great detail.  I know some of the officials and they would recognise me from some points I raised on this matter.  Farmers are subject to intense and rigorous examination and inspection, some of which are on the spot and others they would be forewarned about.  They are now wondering as primary producers, with all they are subject to, if a systems failure led to this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">As Deputies Creed and Sherlock stated, only ten out of fewer than 500 pig farmers are involved.  Notwithstanding the issue of secondary processing, should it have been possible to isolate the problem and not have a countrywide shutdown because the producers cannot be identified?</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I will provide the Minister with an example of the consequences of this as sometimes one picture is worth 10,000 words.  I come from an area with a large pig farming enterprise.  It is currently slaughtering 1,100 pigs per week and creates employment locally for 30 people, which is a small fraction of the total number of employees but is significant in a local area.  Its pigs would never be fed biscuit or bread meal.  All the pigs are fed a cereal-based diet, 60% of which it grows itself and the rest it sources from local farmers.  All its pigs are quality assured to the highest standard in the UK and Ireland.  Some €185,000 of perfectly safe pork produce is sitting in cold storage awaiting a Government decision to release it back onto the market.  Every day the Government delays in supporting the processors another 250 pigs are added to the backlog of pigs for slaughter.  I was told today that in a number of days animal welfare will become an issue as all its pig accommodation will be full.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Another problem is that factories require pigs within a certain weight.  The farmer said to me that the longer the Government leaves Irish produce off the shelves, foreign produce has more opportunity to take its place.  That is the issue.  It is real life and not fiction.  I am reassured by the comments of Dr. Patrick Wall whom I hold in very high regard.  The priority now must be to get the system up and running again to ensure Irish produce and processed pork meats are on the shelves of retailers at home and abroad.  Otherwise, as a farmer said to me, vital market share will be lost as alternative sources of pork and bacon will be obtained from European competitors.  The longer it drags on the more devastating the consequences will be for the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I referred to the beef industry and thankfully the news is good.  There is an excellent, comprehensive and rigorous traceability system in place from the farm to the fork, and that is something we always advocated.  The Minister said less than 0.2% is involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I wish to raise the issue of employees.  I call on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to provide additional personnel and officials to handle the large number of people who will make applications for unemployment benefit.  There are already significant backlogs for people already seeking unemployment benefit.  I ask the Minister to ensure, in the run-up to Christmas, that if people are still unemployed they are not left penniless.  I am aware that people may not return to work immediately.  I need to have that matter clarified.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_168">As I said in my initial reaction to the current crisis, the priority must be to limit the damage done to the sector and to protect the many livelihoods and jobs that are affected.  The scale of the losses incurred by individual pig farmers and suppliers have been significant and is an issue that needs to be dealt with.  We have already seen large scale temporary lay-offs and there is a likelihood that if the correct measures are not taken today further lay-offs will follow.  That is why it is vital that processing and supply to shops begins again immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">There are approximately 7,000 people employed in the industry, including approximately 1,200 on farms, as well as other jobs in transportation and retailing.  We have seen a significant proportion of the processing work force temporarily laid off and a threat of more losses.  There is no reason why things should develop in that manner but it depends upon the industry picking itself up and resuming production.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The crisis over the contaminated produce could not have come at a worse time as farmers have already experienced steep falls in the prices paid to them by the factories over recent months.  Unfortunately, this was attributed in some degree to the lack of domestic consumer demand for Irish pork.  It will not be helped by what is currently happening and makes it all the more important that the right measures are taken, and are taken quickly, to ensure the sector gets back on track.  It also highlights the need to address various issues regarding the marketing of Irish pork and the labelling of pork products.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The export market is also an important aspect of the industry and is equally affected by the current difficulties.  The fact that the European Commission has not banned Irish pork is to be greatly welcomed as a ban would have had catastrophic consequences.  However, it raises another issue regarding the actions that were taken here.  The impact of the current crisis in overseas markets needs to be addressed.  What is happening will have immediate effect, as it has had here on the availability of pigmeat, but there is potential for it to cause longer term damage if the withdrawal of Irish pork undermines overseas consumer confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">That is why it is essential the Government does all in its power to restore the confidence of overseas customers, and it must begin to do this immediately.  An Bord Bia will have a vital role to play in this.  The overseas market is crucial, as we export approximately 60% of our produce and those exports were valued at almost €400 million in 2007.  There are many jobs and many livelihoods dependent on the export market alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Some sections of the British media have treated the issue in a manner that will not help to redress the damage done, and may cause further damage in the long term.  One newspaper, infamous for its role in a number of miscarriage of justice cases, ran a sensational headline referring to toxic Irish pork, while another newspaper referred to pigs here being fed plastic bags.  These are gutter headlines from the gutter press.  That sort of reporting could do immeasurable damage to Irish exports to Britain, which is undoubtedly its intention, and the authorities here must ensure that this stops and that consumers in Britain are provided with the proper information, if necessary by demanding retractions in the newspapers concerned or by placing advertisements.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Another issue that must be addressed is whether the ban, the slaughter of the pigs and the withdrawal of produce from retailers was an over-reaction to the discovery of the contamination.  Professor James Heffron of University College Cork, one of the leading experts in this field, stated that if the data collated by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland proves that the levels of dioxins were within the acceptable limit, then there was no reason to order the withdrawal of pork products from sale.  He stated that these dioxins are in the atmosphere anyway, and if there were similar amounts likely to have been consumed in the small number of products that were sold, then no harm will have been done.  From the very moment the measures were announced, people were being advised that there was no need to be too concerned and no need to seek medical advice.  Therefore, there was and is no real threat to public health.  On a lighter note, I am sure we all know people who had large fries on Sunday morning, in spite of the announcement that products be thrown out.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Based on previous studies into dioxin contamination, both from food and from the chemical plant explosion in Seveso, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has stated that the health risks involved are minimal and will remain so even for anybody who has consumed contaminated produce.   The question therefore must be posed as to whether the withdrawal of all pig meat products was necessary, or whether something like a public health warning might have been more appropriate.  We could have been told the facts as they were known on Sunday morning, the level of risk involved and that it was up to us whether we chose to consume the products affected.  It should have been a judgment call, and on balance, following advice from different groups including the chief medical officer, the correct decision was taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">We are currently experiencing a massive shock to the sector, with so many workers being laid off in the run-up to Christmas, and with farmers, butcher shops and butcher suppliers suffering losses.  There is an urgent need for a financial package that takes cognisance of all the sectors that have lost out heavily.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">There is also an issue with traceability.  Was there a failure in the system? Instead of determining exactly which farms and which animals were contaminated and then tracing the supply line through the processors involved, the entire sector became affected. Once it was known which farms had used the feed, should it not have been possible to determine exactly where the processing of contaminated animals took place, what products resulted from this, and to which retailers or exporters they were sent?  In that way we could have ring-fenced that part of the sector that is free from contamination.  Were officials able to establish this?  If not, why was that the case?  If they were able to trace the destination of the feed and the location of the slaughter of contaminated animals, why then was it not possible to impose more limited restrictions?</p>
          <p eId="para_178">One other issue which might be considered peripheral has also come to attention in the midst of this crisis.  Some retailers were still selling pork products that were labelled as Irish last Sunday.  They were able to do so because the actual meat was produced in other countries but it was packaged in Ireland and then labelled as Irish.  That is a major flaw in the current labelling system and it needs to be addressed in the interests of promoting Irish food produce and for wider health and safety reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The entire sector is going through a very difficult period.  We need to work collectively to address it.  The Government must be proactive in coming up with a financial package that will alleviate the terrible hardships that people are enduring, especially the producers at the lower end who are in urgent need of support.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"><b>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</b> Pig production remains an important part of farming and processing in Cavan and Monaghan, so the Minister will know that there is great local concern about the current crisis, apart from its national implications.  The crisis has already had a major impact, with 140 people put on protective notice at McCarren Meats in Cavan and a further 50 workers temporarily laid off at Feldhuesin Clones.  There have also been layoffs at the Rosderra Meats plant at Stradone.  There were announcements of further layoffs this morning at plants elsewhere in the country, bringing the total number of workers laid off in the sector to around 2,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal contain the main source of pigs that are sent to processors across the Border, which highlights the all-Ireland aspect of this problem.  The Sinn Féin Minister in the Northern Executive, Ms Michelle Gildernew MLA, has overseen the response to the crisis in the Six Counties.  We have been advised that eight beef farms were identified as having used the contaminated feed, and that the relevant restrictions were imposed on them.  No pig farms in the Six Counties received supplies of the contaminated feed.  According to reports today, the food safety authorities in the Six Counties are satisfied that the levels of contamination in the affected beef herds are below that which would pose any risk to human health.  Therefore, there will be no need to impose restrictions there, and we have noted the same assurances here today regarding the relevant beef herds in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">In her contribution this afternoon, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, stated the evaluation process needs to be completed to ensure that all affected product is identified and restricted before post-recall product can be placed on the market.  We as Deputies and the wider public need answers, especially those involved in the sector.  How long will this evaluation process take before we see post-recall product placed back on the market?</p>
          <p eId="para_183">There are many concerns for producers, processors and those who are involved in the preparation of high added value products dependent on pork and bacon.  What compensation will these groups receive?  Who will pay for the significant losses that each of the groups has suffered?  Who will be paid?  Can the Minister give assurances that each of those groups, an integral part of the overall industry, will be fully recognised, respected and compensated?  People are facing absolute ruin if there is no urgency adopted by the Government in indicating the necessary assurances that compensation will be secured, either from the EU or from ourselves if we have to stand alone on this.  Many of these groups are currently distressed and in need of cash, especially in the run up to Christmas, due to the demands of creditors and a need for cashflow to sustain their businesses.  Will any approach be made to the Irish financial institutions to put together a package that will address the needs of this sector during the current crisis?  Access to funds at this stage is critical to the survival of many of those groups I have described.  Can the Minister also note that while empty shelves are bad enough, it is probably only a matter of hours rather than days before we will see foreign pork and bacon produce on Irish shelves in supermarkets throughout this State?</p>

          <p eId="para_185">While it will be hard to try to reintroduce Irish produce to the shelves, its displacement by foreign produce will make it even more difficult.  It is clear that some Irish companies will fold as a consequence of all of this.  The critical objective is not just to see pork and bacon products back on the shelves, accompanied by consumer confidence and all the necessary assurances, but to ensure that Irish pork and bacon products are back on the shelves without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">A number of matters have been addressed, but I would like to ask about other matters that have not been covered.  The House deserves to know what action will be taken against the supplier of the contaminated feed.  That question was not answered in the Minister's address or that of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace.  My colleague, Deputy Ferris, has made reference to reports that inappropriate oil was used in the burning or heating process.  Is it the case that plastic coverings were not removed from pans and loaves of bread that were used in the processing of animal feed?  That question should be answered in the House this afternoon so there is no further uncertainty.  If it is the case, what danger does it present for animals and for the consumer, who is the end user?  To what extent can the Minister be certain that others in this business are not also involved in unacceptable bad practices?  What steps are being taken to examine the activities of others who have the same supply role as the producer of feed in this case?  I ask the Minister to make it clear in his response to Deputies that, arising from this tragic experience, he intends to ensure that from this day forward, nothing other than best practice will be accepted and the necessary inspections and guarantees etc. will be in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I will be very brief.  Does the Minister accept that every minute that passes while Irish produce is absent from supermarket shelves from Tokyo to San Francisco to Moscow will make it more expensive to restore such produce to overseas markets?  For that reason, does the Government accept the State is culpable in the closure of these plants as a result of contamination?  Is the Government prepared to pay the price to ensure processing plants reopen as quickly as possible?  I remind the House no inspection has taken place at the Carlow plant to date in 2008.  Are inspections organised at such plants by appointment?  Farmers do not receive notice when their farms are inspected.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">I would like to conclude by asking about compliance with EU regulations and possible contact from third countries.  Is Ireland in compliance with all EU regulations in areas like food safety?  Prior to last Saturday, did any EU member state contact the Irish authorities to express concern about PCB levels?  If so, at what level did such contact take place?  Did it take place at Food Safety Authority of Ireland level, at Government level, at veterinary level or at any level within the Department?</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_190">I compliment Members on their positive and constructive contributions to the debate on this important issue.  I assure Deputy Creed that no member state contacted the Department or the Food Safety Authority of Ireland before Friday of last week.  We issued a statement on Thursday night to indicate we had restricted farms where non-dioxin marker PCB levels had been found.  It was subsequent to that — some time on Friday — that the Dutch authorities contacted us to inform us of the pattern of dioxins they had found in pork products that had gone through that country.  The first publicity in regard to this potential incident was the press statement on restricted farms that was released by the Department on Thursday night.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I fully appreciate the points that have been made about the opening of the markets.  As soon as this debate concludes, I will return to the Department to meet processors.  The House may be aware that the Taoiseach and I met representatives of the processors, the Irish Farmers Association and individual producers in the Department at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Saturday evening.  We discussed at length the difficulties that would arise from the decision that was about to be announced.  We emphasised the need for all of us to work together to try to get processing up and running again.  We shared the concern the Deputy has expressed about the "pig cycle", if one wants to call it that.  We discussed the numbers that are coming down the line.  We are all conscious that animal welfare issues can arise quickly in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I am concerned that Deputy Creed, like Deputy Sherlock, who referred to the matter in his opening remarks, may have misunderstood the Taoiseach's comment about waiting for the European Food Safety Authority to give us clearance.  That comment related to produce with a small percentage of pork, which is a different issue.  The Department issued a notice to the trade on Sunday evening.  We discussed the disposal problems that have been mentioned by Deputy Creed with the retailers on Sunday evening.  The trade notice that was issued on Sunday evening advised those involved in this trade how they could get back into production the following day.  On Sunday night——</p>

          <p eId="para_200">No.  The facility was due to be inspected in late November or early December of this year.  It is important to make sure that the House is clear on this, as there may have been some misinformation in the public domain in this regard.  In accordance with EU legislation, the Department's national feed inspection programme is part of the overall integrated annual control plan for this country.  A specially trained unit in the Department is devoted to feed inspections.  The Department takes 1,800 samples per annum from the complete range of feed materials.  A total of 7,200 laboratory analyses are carried out.  That is done.  Our control programme was audited in May 2008 within the overall framework of the EU Food and Veterinary Office.  Our systems, inspections and work are audited by the office on an annual basis.  The last audit report, which relates to May of this year, commented favourably on the systems and workings of the Department's programme.  It mentioned that the residue programme has noted a continual decline in the presence of residue in Irish produce.  This risk-based sampling involves taking over 30,000 samples from across the food chain and testing them for over 200 possible contaminants.  The frequency and geographical distribution of the samples taken is laid down in the regulations that come under the EU framework.  The regulations are rigidly followed by the Department as part of an EU-approved programme that has been audited and favourably reported on by the European Union.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">I have three questions.  Will there be a new regulatory framework dealing with non-food grade oil, as I understand it?  My second question relates to the routine sample of pork fat.  The Minister stated on 28 November that a routine sample of pork fat taken as part of his Department's national residue monitoring programme was shown to be positive for the presence of non-dioxin-like marker PCBs.  Is there routine testing for PCBs on an ongoing basis throughout the food industry?  On Friday, 28 November we were told that this indicative testing took place.  On 4 December the Department issued a press release confirming an investigation into the source of a contaminant in animal feed and the restriction of a number of farms.  The Dutch authorities contacted the Department and the FSAI regarding their independent investigation.  When they communicated that, how long had the Dutch authorities' investigation been in train?  When was the rapid alert system kicked into action?  This is also an important point.  The Minister has told us this all happened on this island, effectively.  However, there is a school of thought that suggests the rapid alert kicked in long before this process and we need some clarification on that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I want to give clarification on the last point.  The information that was put in the public domain originated from the analysis, work, research and testing carried out by our authority.  On Saturday the rapid alert system kicked in and all member states were alerted.  However, all member states received the contents of our statement of Thursday evening.  Subsequently — sometime on Friday — the Dutch authorities contacted my Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  They stated at that time that in examining pork products that had come through from different countries they noticed a pattern in the latter half of September that indicated dioxin levels.  That was when the comparison arose.  That is how that happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Ireland operates a residue contamination monitoring programme that is approved by the European Commission.  As part of the monitoring programme, indicator PCBs are sought in samples taken from animals.  Detection of PCBs in Irish meat would be considered to be an unlikely event.  When it arose we sought further analysis that was done in the Central Science Laboratory in York.  That was the chronology of events.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">In this afternoon's national news one of the farmers' organisations instilled fear in many farmers and the nation generally owing to a lack of information on the issue of dioxin in beef.  I ask the Minister to address that fear as soon as possible by putting the proper information in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I was contacted by a representative of four pig farmers in north Donegal who had sent their product to be slaughtered across the Border.  I ask the Minister to give assurances that he will do as much as he possibly can to ensure this issue south of the Border is not used against pig producers south of the Border and in particular in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">When will the new labels be available to processors?  Is there any danger to pork that has been in storage since before 1 September?  When can we expect to see pork products back on the shelves again?</p>

          <p eId="para_221">I was not aware of any statement on the beef issue.  We only got the results back from the FSAI just before lunchtime and we put them in the public domain right away.  I believe it was very important to reassure our consumers and the people involved in the beef industry.  The very strong confirmation from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland of no risk to public health from beef was very important and was welcomed by Deputies Kenny and Gilmore during Leaders' Questions earlier.  I put on the record of the House that results have been received for marker PCBs in beef.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is evaluating the results of the samples taken from 11 herds from the 45 farms that have been restricted as a result of having received potentially contaminated feed and it is satisfied there is no public health concern.  That is the accurate information.  I was not aware of any information to the contrary.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Deputy Blaney asked about storage capacity.  Obviously processors will need to go out and earn market share again.  As we all know every day that is lost causes further difficulty.  We will work with the industry should there be any storage capacity problems.  That is one of the issues we have been discussing.  I instructed Bord Bia, the other State agencies with offices overseas and our embassies to embark on an information exercise to get the proper information to the consumers in the markets that we value so much and that so many of our processors have worked so hard to gain.</p>

Consumers, farmers, processors and the 850 employees in Rosderra Meats in County Offaly are entirely blameless for the situation in which they find themselves.  Every hour we wait will make it more difficult to get operational again as I am sure the Minister is aware.</p>

If a Government programme is put in place we will need to get state aid approval anyway.  We outlined to the European Commission that this is an emergency that is outside the control of the particular industry.  We outlined that we would naturally seek support for aid to private storage and that we would also seek financial support for whatever programme or programmes we finalise.  We alerted the European Commission to it, outlining to it the possible routes we might take.  We hope to finalise talks with processors as early as possible.  While I do not want to keep repeating <i>ad nauseam</i>, it is extremely important that processing gets going again for the sake of employees and for the sake of the industry regaining market share.  Obviously the animal welfare issue will also come down the road at us fairly rapidly if processing does not resume.</p>

Is there any way the Minister can protect the industry here particularly from imports?  On my way to Dublin I spoke to a small food producer who produces sausages, rashers and black puddings.  It is a very small industry outside Cashel with traceability.  It is wrong to say there is no traceability in the pig industry.  The Minister has not asked about traceability enough and checked what traceability these people have.  I have here written codes for times they received products and the suppliers, yet the Minister called it all back.  The Minister and his officials have much to answer for regarding what they have done to the pig industry.  I am very concerned.  I stood with this lady outside her door this morning.  She employs seven people and has been in production only two years.  She is one of the most thorough and efficient people I have ever met in business.  The Government has many questions to answer on what I believe is very important.  What is the Minister doing about the displacements that will come in from outside countries?  Will he go further on traceability in the bacon industry?</p>

Every party representative I know who spoke on behalf of his or her party echoed that strongly on Saturday night.  Earlier I paid tribute to them.

When did the Minister get the results of that laboratory testing in York?  The notice was issued at 3.40 p.m.  Was it issued from York?

We are told that one inspection was scheduled for the end of the year and conveniently this has not happened.  Given the fact that this particular facility — I do not know about the others — had a local authority licence for recycling other materials and that a range of activities were being carried on, does he accept that the level of inspection was not acceptable?</p>

The validation process with regard to a dioxin facility — if I can put it that way — is expected to be validated by February or March 2009.  That process has been happening for some time.  It is not a question of establishing a laboratory and then expecting it to give the results.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">Pigs are identified by farm of origin, they are not identified individually.  Traceability of pork at slaughter and afterwards is on the basis of batch produced which may be a day's production.  My understanding is that this is the system operating throughout the world.  If a big customer for a plant had a particular requirement for absolute traceability in regard to all primal cuts, there could be a production line devoted entirely to one particular customer or it could be a half day's slaughtering, processing or whatever.  When the pig is slaughtered and processed, that foodstuff meat goes in many directions.  Sometimes a customer may require that specific traceability for the primal cuts and that can happen with the current systems.  The traceability of pigs is concerned with the moving off the holdings to the processing plants.  Our identification system is totally in accordance with the European Union regulations and those systems have come into place in recent years.</p>

With regard to her point about Backweston laboratory and the dioxin facility, I am assured that it would have been a delay of a day at the very most.

Will he indicate what steps, if any, he is considering to take or has taken to ensure cash flow and credit from the Irish banks for those involved in the sector?  This is particularly apt given the Government's critical involvement with the Irish banking sector after the recent so-called rescue package.  Will he indicate how quickly the evaluation process will be concluded in order to allow post-recall products back on to the market?

          <p eId="para_389">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_390">That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_391">Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order 2008,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_392">copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 25 November 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion on the Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order 2008.  At present the management and development of the inland fisheries sector resides with the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional fisheries boards.  Members are aware that elections to the regional fisheries boards are due to take place on 16 December 2008 following an extension agreed by the Oireachtas last year.  However, I propose, subject to the approval of the Dáil and Seanad, to make an order postponing elections for a further year.  If this is not done, the existing boards will fall.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">It is not my intention for these boards to continue in existence indefinitely and I am making this proposition with the real prospect of having a restructured streamlined alternative in place for the inland fisheries service during 2009.  This will be delivered in the context of the Government's rationalisation of State agencies generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">In 2005, on foot of an independent review of the inland fisheries sector in Ireland, my predecessor announced plans for significant restructuring of the sector.  However, due to the complexity of the legislation required to implement the proposals and competing priorities, it did not prove possible to introduce the required legislation within the original timeframe envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The proposals put forward in 2005 met with a lot of opposition from all stakeholders and this alternative initiative was considered to represent a deliverable prospect for real change within the sector.  Representatives from the central and regional fisheries boards worked with officials from the Department in developing these proposals and the legislation required to give effect to them in the early part of 2008.  The Minister's consideration of the finalised proposals was, however, overtaken by the review of State bodies by the Department of Finance, announced in July.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">On foot of that review, the Minister for Finance announced in the budget on 14 October that the Government had decided to reduce the number of State bodies and agencies by 41.  As part of this rationalisation process, a new national inland fisheries body is to be established, which will replace the existing central and seven regional fisheries boards.  The eight existing trout and coarse fisheries co-operative societies will also be affected under these restructuring proposals.  This decision has superseded all other proposals under consideration for the future of the sector and will be implemented without delay.  A deadline of August 2009 has been set for the vesting day of the new organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Following the announcement on budget day, I, along with the Minister and officials from the Department, met with the CEOs of the central and regional fisheries boards to outline the Government decision and ensure their support in implementing it.  Following that meeting, a small group, chaired by the Department and with representation on behalf of the existing boards, was established to guide the implementation of the decision.  The group comprises two officials from the Department, the CEO and HR director of the Central Fisheries Board and two of the regional fisheries boards' CEOs.  This group is developing the key features of the new model and has advised on the legislative provisions required to deliver the new regime.  It will also devise appropriate transitional arrangements to ensure the smooth changeover to the new structures next year.  The group is meeting for the fourth time today and I am pleased to say is making good progress towards meeting the target of August 2009 for the establishment of the new body.  I am confident that an effective system can be put in place under the auspices of the new body which will ensure that the important work relating to the inland fishery resource will be implemented efficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">While the proposal involves the creation of a single national authority, the Government is committed to maintaining a strong regional input into the management of inland fisheries.  It is clear from the nature of the inland fisheries work that the new body will require a strong regional presence.  Amending legislation will be required to give effect to the new structures and in this regard the Department is well advanced in the process of drawing up a draft scheme of the Bill.  It is hoped this will be submitted to Government for approval in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I reiterate that the terms and conditions of employment of the staff of the central and regional fisheries boards will not be any less favourable than those currently obtaining.  It is intended that staff will be afforded specific statutory protection in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Outside the context of providing the legislation necessary to facilitate the new structures, a separate examination is also being undertaken as to how the existing 17 pieces of legislation governing the inland fisheries sector, which date back to 1959, can be modernised and consolidated into a single statute.  As the House will appreciate, there is a considerable amount of work involved in such an exercise.  A sub-group of the National Fisheries Management Executive has been established to ensure that those dealing with the consolidated legislation at an operational level will have an input into proposals for the new legislation that will govern the sector.  This group is working closely with the Department on developing legislative proposals and will examine areas such as licensing, rates and conservation imperatives as part of their deliberations.  I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals for that legislation late next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">In the meantime, the focused effort of the Department will be on the legislation enabling the establishment of the new inland fisheries authority.  It is my intention, subject to Government approval, to publish the draft heads of the Bill as soon as they have been approved.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I recognise the valuable contribution made by the existing members of the boards to the inland fisheries in their regions.  I thank them all for their efforts over the years.  Given the significant changes that will be experienced by the sector in the coming year, I am anxious that they would be given an opportunity to maintain that important role not only in ensuring a continuing input to the work of the regional boards, but also in ensuring a smooth transition to the new structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Accordingly, I am proposing to postpone the elections to the regional fisheries boards for a further year in accordance with section 15 of the Fisheries Act 1980.  I wish to advise the House that postponing the elections until 2009 is the only mechanism available to me within the existing statue to provide for the continuation of the existing boards until the establishment of the new body next August.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The order will extend the term of office of the existing board members for a further year or until vesting day of the new authority, which I expect to be in August 2009, at which time the boards will cease to exist.  The order will also result in the postponement of elections to co-operative societies.  This will facilitate the continued contribution from those individuals directly involved in overseeing the service, who will have a key role to play in advancing the restructuring of the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">While I am fully committed to the restructuring of the sector, I recognise that there will be challenges in bringing it about.  The changes to the sector will be progressed on an open and transparent basis.  I thank the members of the implementation group, who have been working hard in that regard.  Last week, I met members of the fishing industry, where we discussed the process of restructuring and I was happy with the support I received from them.  I thank Members for their co-operation and I trust the House will pass the motion approving the order to defer the elections.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_407">I wish to share time with Deputies McHugh, D'Arcy and Ring.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I thank the Minister of State for coming back to me since last week's committee meeting to clarify a number of outstanding issues in this regard.  However, Fine Gael will not support the order because it facilitates government incompetence.  The elections should have taken place two and a half years ago.  We had the same debate as last year when we were informed the only mechanism available to the Government was to postpone the elections for a year to restructure the sector.  A year later we are being asked to the same.  This is not part of the Government's rationalisation plan, even though it has been put in that category.  Three years ago a good report supported by Fine Gael recommended the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector.  However, we have lost patience with the Government's capacity to do this.  We are being asked again to take another leap of faith and to trust the Minister to do what he says he will do this time when this could have been done over the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">We also have concerns regarding the composition of the restructuring implementation group because no outsider is involved to introduce new thinking or experience from abroad.  The group comprises two departmental officials — an assistant secretary and a principal officer — and four, granted they are excellent, officials from the central and regional fisheries boards.  Many good people are working in this sector but if restructuring is to take place and something new is to be done to improve the system and provide efficiencies, new thinking is needed.  An examination of the sector in other countries must be conducted and we need to benefit from their experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The Minister of State is saying that if everyone agrees to restructure, no one will lose his or her job and everyone will retain his or her current working conditions.  We had a similar debate when we agreed to set up the HSE.  Every official was told on the record in no uncertain terms that he or she would retain his or her job and nobody would be inconvenienced but the HSE is a now a mess and similar assurances are being given to fisheries board staff.  People who are working well in the sector should have an input but if we are serious about restructuring and achieving efficiency through an improved system, the Minister of State cannot make a grand statement that nobody will be inconvenienced or upset regarding his or her working conditions.  That does not make sense in the context of restructuring to improve the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I am concerned about the way the Minister of State is going about this and, in particular, that the Government is unable to meet the deadlines it sets for itself.  We have no faith it will do so this time either.  On that basis, we cannot wave another green flag enabling the Government to continue on the road to restructuring the inland fisheries sector because of our experience of its delays and incompetence to date.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_412">I welcome the Minister of State. I refer to the issues I raised at the joint Oireachtas committee meeting last week.  The Government needs to develop a mentality that it has bought into the Good Friday Agreement, which clearly provides for an integrated marine strategy.  This presents a serious challenge because it will create additional layers of bureaucracy.  However, the Government needs to reach out to capable people, for example, in the Loughs Agency who are willing to work with it in partnership.  I do not mean in a tokenistic way because there are ways we can co-operate and share expertise and create opportunities not only to manage our inland waterways but also to promote tourism through joint marketing.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The Minister of State did not mention meeting members from the Loughs Agency, perhaps he is restricted from doing so because of protocol and so on, but I ask him to meet them.  He needs to work more proactively.  The Lough Foyle basin comes under the auspices of Belfast, Dublin and London, which involves many layers of bureaucracy and difficulties.  However, we should be proactive and acknowledge the proposal for an integrated marine strategy, North and South, which will provide opportunities that should be built on.  We should learn from other examples of co-operation such as that between the PSNI and the Garda.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_414">This time last year the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources attended a meeting of our committee and asked us to facilitate the postponement of the elections.  We said we would go with that for one more year but if he showed up 12 months later with the same request, we would not facilitate him further.  I am satisfied that we are correct.  At some stage somebody must get the Government parties into gear to do what they should.  They have a number of years to hold the elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">With regard to the Minister, never has a poacher turned so quickly into a gamekeeper.  When he was in Opposition, he was very excited about the elections being postponed time after time in his role as a poacher but he has been a gamekeeper since he went into government.  How quickly the Green Party members have become immersed in the politics of Fianna Fáil.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_416">I thank Deputy Coveney for sharing time.  Last week the Minister of State met people from my area regarding this issue.  There is great concern about what is happening.  Governments must show leadership but this is the third time elections have been postponed and that sends out the wrong signal.  Deputy Coveney made a valid point about amalgamating the fisheries boards into one regional board which would be elected, yet people will retain their jobs.  I do not say they should be removed but if boards are being amalgamated, jobs will have to be lost.  Deputy Coveney referred to the HSE and we have witnessed what that has created.  Leader boards have been also amalgamated and the same number of people will administer what has to be administered.  We want more efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">It is appalling that the elections are being called off again.  There is no leadership in the Department and I am beginning to wonder whether the Government parties care about this industry.  That is the part of the problem in this country.  This is similar to the issues relating to pigs and cattle that were discussed earlier.  We have had so much corruption in this country for so long that it is spreading down.  We want real leadership and we want the Ministers and the Government to lead the people.  They are sick and tired of what is going on.  There are enough officials in the Department and in the Parliamentary Counsel's office to draft the necessary legislation.  A committee meeting should not have been held last week before the Minister of State came to the House this week to postpone elections again.  It does not make sense and it sends out the wrong signal.  The elections should have taken place and we should be discussing the necessary legislation to deal with the restructuring.  It should have in place for next year but, instead, it has been put off for another year.  The same people are in place and no leadership is being given.  Nothing is happening and that is wrong.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_418">I wish to share time with Deputy Ferris.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The Labour Party is opposed to this order.  It is shameful for a Minister to come back again seeking a further deferral.  It means it will be nine years since elections were held for these regional boards and this is unacceptable.  Each time the order comes back a new Minister's name is on it, along with a new date, and yet again we have a further deferral.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Reforms have been promised over this period.  The reason the original deferral was proposed was for reforms to be made but this did not happen.  Now the excuse is given that the budget provided for consolidation and change to come about and we are expected to believe all of this will be done and dusted by August 2009.  It is extremely difficult for us to believe that this has any credibility when one considers the track record in this sorry saga.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">There is an "illogic" — if there is such a term — whereby we are being asked to defer elections on the basis that elections will not be held next year.  This raises questions on what we are doing here.  There is an inaccuracy in the order which refers to section 15(4) but it is section 15(3) of the Fisheries Act which is relevant.  I am happy for the Minister of State to make this change as a technical change.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Is a legal issue raised?  I hope the Minister of State has taken legal advice because there is at least a variance between the order and the original Act.  Section 15, which is the section of the Act referred to, allows for postponement.  However, from the wording it appears to allow for one postponement, which was made back in 2005, but not for serial postponement which has led to a different wording on the order from that in the Fisheries Act.  I am curious to know whether the Minister of State has taken legal advice.  He stated this is the only way to defer elections.  It might be worthwhile to know whether he has taken legal advice to see whether what he is doing is sound.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I thank the Minister of State for the information he sent us with regard to the various questions raised, in particular with regard to the audited accounts for 2007.  I appreciate they have finally come through and I ask that they be published as soon as possible.  When this proposal was made in 2006, the current Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was extremely critical of the approach being adopted by the then Minister.  He used sensational words and spoke about a shocking indictment and an act of cowardice.  Now we are presumed to simply entertain the idea that this is fine and part of a reform process and that we should not challenge anything the Minister is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">We have a bad precedent in terms of reform.  We have seen how the HSE came into being and what a disaster it was.  I recall very clearly, because I was spokesperson for health at the time, warning the Minister that she was in danger of creating a new monster and that is exactly what happened.  It was not properly prepared for or planned.  I have concerns that the Minister of State is telling us that everything will be sorted by August but he cannot tell us, and I have raised this at committee meetings, what are the transitional plans for these new structures.  How will regional management and accountability be maintained in these new structures?  What is the redundancy package?  Will there be voluntary redundancy?  What are the staffing requirements for the Central Fisheries Board?  What are the accommodation requirements in terms of the new arrangements and the new agency?</p>
          <p eId="para_425">We need to see good robust management.  We have seen yet another problem arise in terms of Government failure to deliver on an IT facility which promised a major change on how the public could access information.  Government competence is at issue here as much as anything else.  So far, the track record is abysmal.  I am concerned that if we simply nod this through we will facilitate further incompetence in the future.  Will the Minister of State consider the points made here and return with answers?  He has provided some answers but other answers are required on how this change, if it is to be managed properly, will be done within the timeframe.  One sure thing is that it will not be tolerated if he returns again with the same rigmarole and expects us to nod it through as he expects us to do now.</p>

It is an awful indictment that this is the third occasion on which the election to the new structure has been proposed.

          <p eId="para_430">If the existing boards fall it will not be Opposition's fault it will be the Government's fault because it has failed to bring forward the necessary legislation during the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I agree the current structures need improvement.  While the regional boards, with which I have worked through the years, left a lot to be desired at times, in general they were representative in so far as one had access and someone from a coastal or rural community would know somebody on the board whom he or she could contact and who would take issues on board and raise them at meetings.  As Deputy McManus stated, we will have to see what are the proposals and see how representative and democratic it will be.  I have a feeling this will be extremely centralised and one will not have the same accessibility as one has through the regional boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I also agree with the points raised by Deputy McManus regarding the legal legitimacy of postponing these elections.  It would be extremely helpful if the Minister of State would share the legal advice he received so we can form our own opinion on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I, on behalf of my party, will not support this motion for the reasons outlined.  I hope the Minister of State takes them on board.  It is an awful indictment on the Government that we are back here for the third time and we still do not have an election.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">I made the point at last week's meeting in Leinster House with industry representatives that despite the change that is taking place, we will continue to place great emphasis on the regions.  In that context, a certain amount of the co-operation that is taking place in the regions will continue.  Instead of a chief executive officer, we will have regional managers who will not have the difficulty and demand on their time of managing and working with a regional board.  Instead, they will only have to consult and work directly with one central board.  This will afford them more time to work with local fishermen and fishing organisations, thus enhancing the traditional co-operation we have had in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I cannot answer Deputy McManus's query regarding the wording of the order but will undertake to have the matter examined in detail.  The order itself is being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel of the Office of the Attorney General.

        <heading>Report of Sub-Committee on Ireland’s Future in the EU: Statements. </heading>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_262">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_591">I am pleased, in this important week before the European Council, to have this opportunity to address the House on the recently completed report of the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the sub-committee: to its Chairman, Senator Pascal Donohue, its Vice Chairman, Deputy Timmy Dooley, the members and the many witnesses, all of whom worked to extremely demanding deadlines to deliver the report that is the subject of our discussion this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The genesis of the report lies in the aftermath of the referendum, when I explained to my European Union colleagues that Ireland would need time to seek to understand the concerns underlying the "No" vote, "to engage in serious and careful analysis of the outcome of the referendum and its implications", as I said at the European Council in June.  This analysis took two forms.  First, we commissioned independent research into the reasons behind the vote, with which all Members are familiar.  We made great efforts to make the results of this research widely available.  For the most part, the study confirmed what many of us suspected.  Other findings, for example, on conscription, were more surprising.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">While the figures emerging from the study are interesting, we were and are determined that the exploration of the reasons underlying the vote would move beyond a mere interrogation of data.  We wanted a deeper engagement with the issues that were on the minds of the Irish people when they cast their vote in June.  Working with the other political parties represented in this House, we supported the establishment by the Oireachtas of an all-party sub-committee — a sub-committee that reached beyond party allegiance to include Independents — to examine the issues that contributed to the referendum result.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">It was agreed that the sub-committee should carry out its work under four broad headings: to analyse the challenges facing Ireland in the European Union following the Lisbon treaty referendum result; to consider Ireland's future in the EU including with regard to economic and financial matters, social policy, defence and foreign policy and our influence within the European institutions; to make recommendations to enhance the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in EU affairs; and to consider measures to improve public understanding of the EU and its fundamental importance for Ireland's future.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The sub-committee's report, which is both well structured and well written, mirrors this mandate in its chapter layout.  From the outset, the sub-committee's work was guided by the requirement to be as inclusive as possible.  It is galling, therefore, to hear accusations that the sub-committee was in some way skewed or prejudiced in its work.  The sub-committee was designed to be inclusive, both in its membership and in its witnesses.  All the political parties in the Oireachtas were represented, including those which had campaigned against the treaty, to ensure as broad a range of voices as possible was heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">In all, over the course of its work, the sub-committee met more than 110 witnesses from more than 40 organisations from inside Ireland and abroad.  These organisations represented a wide spectrum in terms of input, viewpoints and concerns.  It is a matter of regret that not all members of the sub-committee could agree to its final report.  For my part, I am satisfied that the sub-committee's overall analysis of the challenges facing Ireland is fair and comprehensive and represents an important contribution to our search for a way forward in the difficult circumstances in which we now find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The sub-committee was not mandated to recommend a solution to the post-referendum situation, nor did it do so.  Nevertheless, its work has provided an extremely valuable input for the Government in preparing for this week's European Council meeting.  This tight deadline partly was consistent with the Government's desire to have the sub-committee's input before it would take a position at the European Council later this week.  That the sub-committee managed to report within such a timeframe is a credit to the commitment and energy of all who were involved in its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The report is underpinned by one profoundly encouraging finding, namely, that Ireland's place is at the heart of the European Union, contributing positively and deploying our influence carefully to promote our national interests.  That said, the report recognises that Ireland's ability to do this — to contribute positively and defend our interests — has been, at the least, impaired and that real, long-term damage to our interests will arise if we fail to find a way through the present impasse.  This is a key point.  Some were frustrated during the course of the sub-committee's work at what they perceived was a difficulty in identifying specific instances of damage being done.  The important point made by this report is that the damage has been systemic more than specific and that while certain individual cases can be pointed to, much more significant is the wholesale shift in the perception of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">For right or wrong, our partners abroad — whether they are investment boards of multinational companies deciding on where to invest in Europe or foreign governments assessing where their "friends" lie when they are doing business at EU level — perceive a change in our attitude.  Our position has traditionally been enthusiastically European, at the centre of negotiations, working to secure outcomes with the broadest possible appeal and pragmatic and constructive.  I fear we may no longer be perceived in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">It was reassuring for all who care about Ireland's future in the Union to see the issues identified empirically by the research project being reinforced, again and again, at the sub-committee.  This suggests we are on the right track in our search for a solution at the European level.  In addition to this reassurance about our EU level approach, the sub-committee's recommendations about our domestic approach make very interesting reading.  An Oireachtas sub-committee is uniquely well positioned to comment on domestic practices and procedures and the sub-committee's report does not disappoint in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">A majority of the sub-committee's suggestions relate to domestic practices and procedures for the way we do EU business.  Many of them have important consequences for the Houses of the Oireachtas, for example, its recommendations for electoral change, procedural change, an Oireachtas communications strategy and new scrutiny mechanisms.  There is a clear sense running through the report that we need to reconsider the manner in which both Houses engage in the business of the EU.  It is reassuring for me as Taoiseach to see such a willingness on the part of the Oireachtas to participate in this important aspect of our international relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">While the decision on whether to proceed with many of the sub-committee's proposals will rest with the Oireachtas, the Government approaches this matter with an open mind and will not be found wanting in its response.  In publishing the sub-committee's report, the Oireachtas has completed what the Minister for Foreign Affairs has fairly described as "its most sustained exploration of the issues surrounding our membership of the EU since we first joined".  This, in itself, is an extremely healthy undertaking.  That this exchange took place against the backdrop of such unprecedented economic events, globally, Union-wide and domestically, serves only to underline the importance of the questions under examination by the sub-committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Taken together, the independent research commissioned by the Government and the report of the sub-committee provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the reasons the Irish people voted as they did.  One extremely important consideration affecting people's decisions was their lack of understanding of the content of the treaty.  This is something we will need to remedy ourselves, although this does not exclude working closely with the EU institutions or others on this task.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Where our engagement with the Union is concerned, however, it is clear that there are a number of areas where the Irish people will require reassurance.  I outlined four of these when I spoke at the European Council in October.  They include the future composition of the Commission; issues related to defence and our tradition of neutrality; social-ethical matters; and taxation.  The resolution of these matters will not be an easy task.  The Lisbon treaty represents the finely balanced conclusion of a protracted negotiation between the member states of the Union.  That said, the Government has made clear in all of its dealings with our partners that the Irish people have real concerns which are genuinely held and require responses.  There is understanding for our position among partners and a willingness among them to work with us.  However, I would be failing in my duty if I suggested to the House that we have an easy task ahead of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Some partners have been ready to be accommodating, while others have raised serious concerns.  All of the member states of the Union made concessions in order to reach agreement on the language of the treaty.  Some went a short distance to reach consensus while others travelled a very long way, making key concessions out of a spirit of compromise.  These states remain keenly aware of the sacrifices they made.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I have been engaged in intensive consultations with fellow member states and the institutions in recent weeks.  In our discussions, we have sought to tread a careful path between ensuring that the concerns of the Irish people can be responded to, while not causing insurmountable difficulties for others.  As the House will understand, even at this late stage, mere days before the European Council, I am not in a position to describe in detail the shape of the agreement which may be reached at the end of this week. I would venture to say, no one is in a position to do so.  If the Treaty of Lisbon is to enter into force, it requires the agreement of all member states.  I have a clear idea of what we want.  The Government will need to be able to reassure the people that their genuinely held concerns have been taken on board by the other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">When I travel to the European Council this week I will aim to achieve a political agreement that the concerns of the Irish public with regard to the treaty will be responded to in a satisfactory way, both in substance and in a legally robust manner.  This week will be a real test of the Union's capacity to accommodate our respective needs.  The Union has that capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The Minister for Foreign Affairs was quoted over the weekend as saying talks would go to the wire.  I agree with that assessment.  It will only emerge later this week whether we have agreed the elements of a solution that we judge to meet our needs.  That note of caution aside, I have been encouraged by the strength of commitment shown by others, in particular, the French Presidency, in helping us to find a way forward.  There is a genuine wish on all sides to reach a solution and we will do everything possible to build on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The Union is a dynamic system, which is in constant flux as it seeks to improve the way it does business.  Where it has come across problems, it has always shown itself to be constructive and creative in finding solutions.  Where new challenges have been thrown down, it has risen to meet them.  It is my deep hope that, come Friday evening, building on the Government's work to date and the strong sense of solidarity between member states, we will have moved one step closer to resolving the dilemma in which Ireland and the European Union find themselves.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_610">I commend Senator Paschal Donohoe and his colleagues on the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union on the work they have done in the past two months.  The sub-committee's report is a valuable analysis of the position in which Ireland finds itself as a result of the rejection of the Lisbon treaty in a referendum.  It is clear from the hearings of the sub-committee that there is doubt and uncertainty about this country's relationship with the European Union.  This doubt is damaging Ireland's international standing at a time when the economy is in crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Taoiseach's contribution did not deal with the core issues.  His statement that the Treaty of Lisbon requires the agreement of all member states to enter into force is correct, everybody knows that is the case.  What was his contribution about other than mentioning four specific issues — the future composition of the Commission, issues related to defence and our tradition of neutrality, social-ethical matters and taxation — which the European Council and European Commission will not have difficulty addressing.  We know they will not cause any great problem with binding declarations which can come into a protocol in the next accession treaty.  The Taoiseach has not dealt with fact the that if this treaty is to come into effect it must be endorsed by every country.  It was not endorsed by this country and cannot be endorsed by a circuitous legal mechanism.  The people must be asked the question again and nothing in this report states that or when it will happen.  That is the problem for Ireland and Europe.  President Sarkozy may say "We need you and you need us".  From my movement around the country, I have seen little confidence that the Taoiseach or the Government have the capacity to steer this through so we can continue to be a respected and influential member of the decision-making process of the European Union, which I strongly favour.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I am dismayed that since the referendum, apart from the sub-committee that was established, we have had no discussion on this problem.  The Government needs the support of the parties in the House if it is to go back and do this.  We are prepared to take things from the Government in respect of what it is doing.  We were told we would receive information on other analysis being done on this but there has not been one word other than the hearings of the sub-committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I make no bones about it; Fine Gael has always supported the European process and has campaigned and worked for every referendum on European issues.  Now, two days before the Taoiseach goes to the European Council to deal with the four issues which the Council will respond favourably to, he must give a response on what he will do.  It contacts me every second day looking for a road map from the Irish Government.  There is no point making mountains out of something on which it will concede.  It is not a concession on its behalf; some of these issues have been dealt with by previous treaties such as the Maastricht treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The Taoiseach travelled the Continent talking to Heads of Government and he has had presentations to the diplomatic corps who talk among themselves and to others, but there has been no discussion here, 48 hours before he travels to Brussels.  This discussion would not have taken place had we not raised the matter with the Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_623">I am telling him our point of view and I have laid out clearly what we must do to have endorsement of the Lisbon treaty.  The Taoiseach's speech mentioned nothing other than four issues of the European Council in October.  I guarantee they will go through at the meeting but I want to know his response.  He knows that himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The Minister knows there must be meaningful discussion with the people to rebuild understanding of and support for the European process.  There is a deep appreciation among people for the pivotal role and meaning of EU membership in the economic and social progress of the country over the last decade.  People can see the immediate reduction in mortgage repayments as a result of the ECB reducing its interest rates.  These are important elements of everyday life in considering being of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">There is a recognition that this country's future best lies at the heart of a reformed, efficient and effective Europe.  The Taoiseach mentioned that the referendum campaign and subsequent voter research revealed a very low level of public understanding of the role and functioning of the Union and a perception that Europe is responsible for excessive bureaucracy and regulation.  That is obvious from the meetings the Minister and I attended around the country.  This disconnect is a significant challenge for everybody.  I have argued, since before the referendum when the Government was involved in other activities internal to it, about the importance of Europe and Ireland's future progress.  I pointed out that, for younger people in particular, the initial monumental success of the European project in securing peace and stability is simply an historic fact.  Many do not remember, because they were not yet born, a time when we all had our different currencies.  For us it happened relatively recently but for them it is a different era.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Those committed to the European process cannot depend on past achievements if we are to build public support in the future, because they are simply historic facts.  We must move with the times and change for the future.  We must persuade people that a reformed, democratic and efficient Europe is essential to meet economic and political challenges we face with the growth of emerging economies all over the world.  Other issues are climate change, energy security and Third World development.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">In the past five months, we undertook comprehensive consultations on this matter, within the party with legal advisers and other experts.  Arising from these consultations we published a list of initial proposals to improve public support for the European process, with the ultimate aim of creating the conditions whereby this country can ratify the Lisbon treaty.  We want a strengthened role for the Oireachtas on European issues.  Given the proportion of legislation that originates from European Union directives and regulations, the work of the committee on European scrutiny is a crucial function.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The Minister's predecessor upgraded it to full committee status and I respect this.  It is a crucial committee and must be resourced properly to understand the significant directives coming and what they mean for Ireland.  This role will be further enhanced should the Lisbon treaty come into force with a provision to strengthen the role of national parliaments in the EU decision-making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The current powers of the committee are too narrow.  Fine Gael wants the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 to be amended to increase the powers of the committee so it can require Ministers to appear before it prior to attending meetings where decisions are made in Brussels and to return and seek reports.  We also favour giving the committee the power to invite submissions or accept petitions on EU law or legislative proposal from members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Fine Gael proposed the establishment of a new constitutional office of a European Union citizens' officer.  This appointee would act as an independent advisory officer on all aspects of European Union legislation, including its transposition into Irish law.  He or she would work closely with the European committees of the Oireachtas and have the power to make recommendations to Government on all aspects of European Union legislative development.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">This watchdog role would be parallel or comparable to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and would also be responsible for providing impartial information on the facts of European issues, including when conflicting arguments arise.  People often do not have much faith in the political process.  A constitutional officer, as part of the Constitution, would be a form of comfort, protection and absolute objectivity.  The creation of this office would require a constitutional referendum which could be held on the day of the local and European elections or with the children's referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Many groups and individuals have complained bitterly about the impact of regulation and red tape, which is a consequence of how the European Union does its business.  In some cases, such as the imposition of water charges on schools, the EU is wrongly blamed by Ministers.  When the news is bad Brussels is blamed and when it is good they take the credit.  There is a perception that the European Union is responsible for excessive regulation of the environment, food safety, business and direct payments to farmers.  We have had this all over the country.  Have we done anything about it?  We have not.  There is also a sense that for some of these sectors, there is a more stringent and vigorous approach to implementation in Ireland than in other member states.  Some say directives are transposed into law here to the tenth degree on the first day, rather than phased in with flexibility and common sense as happens in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">An independent audit should be commissioned into the transposition and implementation of EU law in Ireland.  This audit would prioritise areas that have caused concern and controversy for farmers, sheepmen, bog cutters, small business people and so on.  It would include an international comparative analysis in order that it can be established if greater flexibility is being applied in other member states.  Such an audit should invite submissions from the public which feels aggrieved at the impact of the implementation of EU legislation on their lives or business activities.  There is no clarity on what aspects of international treaties require constitutional approval.  Fine Gael proposes a second constitutional change to allow future international treaties — not the Lisbon treaty — to be referred to the Supreme Court when agreed in order that we could establish what exactly was in those international treaties that would require a referendum.  Can anybody in the House tell us what aspect of the Lisbon treaty actually requires a referendum?  It would make eminent good sense for a future Government to send an agreed international treaty to the Supreme Court to find out what elements of the treaty actually required constitutional endorsement.  The Government should also pursue negotiations with our European partners aimed at establishing a transparent vetting procedure for judges nominated for appointment to the European Court of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">It is clear that the referendum result has created doubts about Ireland's position in the European Union.  It is also clear, from the evidence of Irish officials before the sub-committee, that the perception of Ireland as a positive and constructive participant in EU decision making is weakened by the current situation.  The fact that 25 of the 27 member states have already ratified the treaty — another member is likely to do so — creates a dilemma for Ireland.  It is clear that the other member states are opposed to any renegotiation of the treaty, but there is a willingness to help this country in other ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Some experts have suggested it may be legally possible for the Lisbon treaty to be ratified in whole or in part through the Oireachtas.  I do not agree with that approach because it is very uncertain and open to the perception that it is bypassing the will of the people.  The eventual solution to this question must be based on a referendum.  On the day the referendum votes were counted I said the same question could not be put to the people a second time in the same way.  There must be a tangible difference in the proposition in order that we propose that each member state retain the right to nominate a Commissioner.  This cannot be achieved without ratification of the Lisbon treaty, as the current treaties require a reduction in size at the end of next year.  The Government should seek a formal, binding, European Council decision to the effect that, should the Lisbon treaty be ratified, it will use the reverse clause in the treaty for the appointment of a Commissioner in every country.  I campaigned differently before the referendum, but if that is what the people in Europe need, that is fair enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">We should opt in on co-operation on justice and home affairs issues.  We have seen €700 million worth drugs seized off the Cork coast and €100 million worth of drugs seized beyond Mizen Head.  We should face up to this issue and support the efforts to combat international crime across countries.  The results of crime are there for everybody to see, with tragic consequences such as the expansion of anti-social behaviour in Dublin.  The Government should abandon the opt-out in this area, which would make eminent sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">There are a couple of other clarifications to be made.  During the referendum campaign concerns were expressed that the Lisbon treaty could lead to changes in the powers of national governments on direct taxation, military neutrality, conscription and abortion.  All of these issues can be dealt with and some of them have been dealt with in other treaties.  Given the doubts generated, Fine Gael believes the Government should seek clarification from our EU partners, confirming that the Lisbon treaty will not change the current legal position on these issues.  We favour these clarifications in the form of directives and decisions, similar to the form taken by Denmark following its rejection of the Maastricht treaty.  Such decisions can be deemed to be legally binding when registered with the United Nations as international agreements and subsequently incorporated into protocols attached to the next treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">These initiatives would make a real difference to public attitudes towards the European Union.  Ireland can be restored to a central role in the Union in a way that will be both understood and supported by the people.  These proposals, put forward constructively by Fine Gael, would add greatly to dealing with the concerns of the people about the Lisbon treaty and the future of the European Union.  The Taoiseach should not take for granted the support we have always given in European referenda.  I want to see this endorsed fully, but the Taoiseach should not get locked into some half-hearted, woolly strategy that could put the future of this country's participation in the European Union at risk. I regret that there has been no real consultation by the Government parties with the Opposition parties about something that is so fundamental to the future of every person living on this island.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_639">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about the report on Ireland's future in the European Union, which I commend to the House.  It is the culmination of seven weeks of intensive work by the 12 Oireachtas Members who sat on the sub-committee.  I pay tribute to its Chairman, Senator Paschal Donohoe, who was excellent throughout, and the Vice Chairman, Deputy Timmy Dooley, who stepped in when the occasion arose, as well as to my colleagues on the sub-committee who made great contributions over the seven weeks.  I also pay tribute to the secretariat for the dedication shown which was way above the call of duty.  They had to work long hours to ensure various drafts and amendments were put together on time, especially towards the end of the deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">In this age of tribunals, consultants, public relations schools, expensive lawyers and quangos, it is refreshing that Members of the Oireachtas, assisted by public servants, can complete an important job on time and at virtually no cost to the taxpayer.  It is a model for carrying out similar work in the future.  It is time that controversial issues of public concern were dealt with directly by a parliamentary committee, rather than being farmed out to external bodies, which take forever and often cost the Earth.  The legal and administrative changes that may be required to facilitate such Oireachtas examination and investigation should be made as quickly as possible in the public interest.  This type of analysis could be undertaken on any future treaties that come before us and we could bring in expert witnesses, stakeholders and invite the general public to contribute in order that we would be in a better position when holding a referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Membership of the European Union has been a voyage of discovery for Ireland since we joined in 1973.  It broadened the horizons of an island nation which had been obsessed with and dominated by its larger neighbour.  The European Economic Community was based on principles of equality and solidarity between member states, whether great or small.  This was an entirely new factor in the Irish political and economic experience and it was very welcome.  The European Union also provided the political and economic context for the peaceful resolution of the Northern Ireland conflict and brought peace to the entire island for the first time in centuries.  Now, 35 years on, Ireland's relationship with the European Union is in something of a crisis.  There are new concerns about Ireland's future engagement with the Union.  The Lisbon treaty referendum highlighted the problem.  Some 53% of the electorate voted "No" in the referendum.  In subsequent polls, particularly the Millward Brown survey, a clear majority of people wanted Ireland to remain firmly at the heart of the European Union.  The challenge facing the Government is to resolve this apparent conundrum — to square the circle of rejection, on the one hand, and the desire for engagement, on the other hand.  The Government's response should not deteriorate into an exercise in navel-gazing or national introspection.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The economic recession, the demise of the Celtic tiger and the failings of the political establishment could easily create a negativity and distrust that would cause the people to use the European Union as an easy scapegoat once more.  Unscrupulous Governments and uncaring stakeholders have repeatedly taken credit for the benefits conferred during the years by Ireland's membership of the European Union.  At the same time, they have blamed many of their own shortcomings on the Union.  Such interests have made the EU a scapegoat and damaged its credibility among many Irish people.  Some of the real culprits are in this House.  They are, in no small measure, responsible for the rejection of the Lisbon treaty.  The Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union heard again and again from people who have suspicions, fears, doubts, concerns and misgivings about Ireland's relationship with the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Ireland can no longer take the EU for granted as a cash cow to be milked at will and blamed for the ills of the nation as the cash dries up.  As a member of the Party of European Socialists, the Labour Party has a long history of internationalism dating back to its origins and the origins of the trade union movement.  Solidarity between working men and women, regardless of national boundaries, is at the heart of the labour movement.  The EU has been a positive force in vindicating workers' rights during the decades.  A fairly comprehensive statement made by Mr. Blair Horan, which is included in the sub-committee's report, set out the role of the EU in this regard.  He said he could not "conceive of any significant item of worker's rights legislation in the last 35 years that has not emanated from the Union, starting with the equal pay legislation".  The provisions of the Lisbon treaty, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the social clause and the restatement of the Union's values and principles, further enhance and strengthen protections for working men and women.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I have a couple of important things to say before the Taoiseach leaves.  I consider it somewhat alarming that neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs has articulated publicly any interest in dealing with the issues the Labour Party sees as central to this debate.  The Taoiseach referred to issues like the size of the European Commission, taxation, conscription, neutrality and sensitive social and ethical matters.  The issues in question have been discussed during the Taoiseach's whistle-stop tour of the various EU capital cities.  The issues affecting workers and the trade union movement do not appear to be of major concern to the Taoiseach, however.  In the statement he made at the start of this debate, he referred to four critical issues — the future composition of the Commission, issues related to defence and our tradition of neutrality, social-ethical matters and taxation.</p>

          <p eId="para_648">I am concerned about sensitive social issues.  I want to make it clear that the support of the Labour Party cannot be taken for granted by the Government.  In our submission to the sub-committee, we stated categorically that our interest lies where the interests of workers lie.  That is included in the report, which strongly reflects our views on the way forward.  Some 40% of the electorate stated that the validation of workers' rights is an important issue for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">When the Taoiseach travels to the meeting of EU Heads of State in Brussels on 11 and 12 December, he will present the elements of the solution as he sees it.  The Labour Party considers that it is absolutely essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is included in the treaty.  It should not be possible to opt out from that.  The charter must be at the heart of any new solution.  There must be no question of an opt-out.  Member states need to be able to provide public services for their citizens without any fear of competition or privatisation.  The posting of workers directive must be amended to the satisfaction of the European trade union movement and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The fundamental rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and industrial action must take precedence when the four freedoms of the Single Market come into conflict in the workplace.  Various proposals have been made in this area.  The European Trade Union Confederation proposed that a protocol could be appended to a future treaty to clarify the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The loose transposition of the posting of workers directive by a number of countries, including Ireland, has allowed the European Court of Justice to interpret the Monti clause, which was added to the services directive, in a way that disadvantages workers in terms of industrial action and pay and conditions in a number of cases.  I refer to cases in which there is an apparent conflict between the four freedoms, such as the Lavalle, Rüffert, Luxembourg and Viking cases.  There are serious concerns about the fundamental right of each worker to carry out his or her business in a way that is normal in his or her host country.  The posting of workers from other countries to work on a temporary basis has caused a huge amount of grief in the trade union movement.  It was largely responsible for such a large percentage of workers stating that they are unhappy with the direction the European Union is taking in the area of workers' rights.  If this issue is not addressed, it will be impossible for the Labour Party and the labour movement to support any resolution the Government might negotiate with our European partners.  At no stage have I heard the Taoiseach articulate in public that he intends to agree a defined position on these matters with his counterparts in the other 26 EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The Government needs to engage in consultation with the Opposition parties.  Before this debate, I hoped the Taoiseach would mention some of the matters which the Government intends to negotiate with its partners.  I refer to matters in respect of which the Government thought it had made progress, and positive work has taken place, over recent days and weeks.  Unfortunately, we are as much in the dark following the Taoiseach's speech as we were before he entered the Chamber this afternoon.  It seems that when the Taoiseach leaves the country on Thursday, we will be none the wiser on what is his bargaining position.  Therefore, we do not know whether he will enjoy the support of this House in that respect.  Unless we are consulted further before Thursday, the Taoiseach will be unable to say to his European counterparts that he has the support of this House.  Almost all Members of the House supported his position in the referendum earlier this year.  We have to make it clear where we are going in the future, however.  We cannot go together if the Taoiseach does not say where he stands on these issues.  He has not yet indicated his position at this time.  Before this debate finishes, perhaps he will give us some indication of how he proposes to proceed between now and Thursday.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, might highlight some of the elements of the roadmap the Taoiseach will present to his colleagues.  We will then be in a position to decide whether we are willing to participate in that road map.  I ask the Taoiseach to make that clear.  I thank him for staying to listen to what I have to say.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">I have mentioned the main points that essentially need to be addressed.  Other issues, such as the enhanced role of the Oireachtas, are extremely important.  If we do not conduct our domestic business properly and are not involved at the beginning in drafting of services directives and legislation coming through from the European Union, and if we do not monitor it the whole way through and do not transpose it into law in a proper fashion, we are not doing our work properly.  Much of that has been loosely addressed in the past.  We must put in place a better mechanism to ensure all of that becomes a coherent whole from the start of the work programme that is presented at the beginning of the year by the Commission right through to its transposition and implementation here.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The question of engagement with the public is a matter for another day, but must be addressed.  We must find mechanisms whereby first, this House is relevant in terms of the European Union and second, the public is also invited in to participate and engage in matters European.  While we have not done that, modern technology allows us to do so and we should ensure it is done.  Unless we are engaging in Europe on the floor of this House as regularly as possible, communicating with the public and inviting the public to communicate with us, I cannot see us making much progress in this arena.</p>

Tá sé tábhachtach déileáil le tuairisc an fhochoiste agus leis an chaoi ar éirigh leis an obair a cuireadh roimhe a dhéanamh.

          <p eId="para_656">It has been obvious since as early as June that the Government had absolutely no intention of addressing the concerns of the electorate on the Lisbon treaty and instead set itself on a course to rerun the referendum.  At no point in the past six months did the Taoiseach ask any EU leader to renegotiate the treaty, nor did the Government even consider for one minute the option of using the mandate it had been given for the good of this country.  It is clear that later this week the Taoiseach will announce his intention to ignore the democratically expressed views of the electorate and will announce the holding of a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  It is clear that in doing so he will be supported in this by the Green Party, the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  Shame on them all for ignoring the democratic wishes of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">There is deep anger at the arrogance of the Government and its mishandling of the current economic crisis.  This will be worsened if it pursues such a high-handed, undemocratic course as to put the Lisbon treaty to a referendum again.  The people voted for a better deal and that deal should have been delivered by the Government.  I believe that the almost 1 million people who rejected the Lisbon treaty and those who voted for it but respect the democratic outcome will make their views known in next year's European Parliament elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Maidir leis an fochoiste agus an deis a cailleadh nuair a bunaíodh é agus le linn a chuid oibre, nílim ag fáil lochta ar na státseirbhísigh ná fiú baill an choiste a rinne a lán oibre.

          <p eId="para_659">The sub-committee provided the opportunity for a deep and meaningful engagement with the public on the direction of the European Union.  Instead it was a missed opportunity.  Its report was always going to mirror the views of the Government given the limited terms of reference and refusal to engage with wider public to understand their views.  The Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union started its work on 8 October.  Its terms of reference were to:</p>
          <p eId="para_660">analyse the challenges facing Ireland in the European Union (EU) following the Lisbon Treaty Referendum result;</p>
          <p eId="para_661">consider Ireland's future in the EU including in relation to economic and financial matters, social policy, defence and foreign policy and our influence within the European Institutions;</p>
          <p eId="para_662">make recommendations to enhance the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in EU affairs;</p>
          <p eId="para_663">[and] consider measures to improve public understanding of the EU and its fundamental importance for Ireland's future.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">While that was a laudable remit in some terms, it was a duplication of the work of the National Forum on Europe, which still exists to my knowledge.  Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Oireachtas sub-committee, my party colleague, Senator Doherty, warned against the Government's attempt to reshape the public debate on Lisbon away from the treaty itself to one of Ireland's membership of the EU.  He also emphasised that the debate must be led by the general public and not politicians who clearly from the referendum result are out of sync with ordinary people.  He went on to say that critically we must use the outcome of the debate to inform and change Government policy on the EU in order that it reflects the Irish people's views on its future.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Sinn Féin took a constructive and positive role in the work the committee.  However, we made it clear that we would not take part in any choreography to set aside the democratic wishes of the electorate.  Sinn Féin was concerned that it was the Government's intention, with the support of Labour, Fine Gael and the Green Party, to use the committee as a space to prepare the groundwork for a rerun of the Lisbon treaty referendum.  We argued that the terms of reference for the sub-committee were too restrictive and that the focus of the debate should be the future of the EU and Ireland's role in shaping that future.  The Government and other parties rejected our proposals for more inclusive terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The founding principles of EU were and must continue to be peace and prosperity.  We want to see Ireland continue to play a central role in shaping the future of the EU in the interests of all citizens.  We are ambitious for what we, as a small member state, can achieve in the interest of all the people of the EU.  It is important to emphasise Sinn Féin's view that Ireland's place is at the heart of the EU.  We want the Government and people to play a central role in shaping the future of the EU.  Our policy of critical engagement means supporting those aspects of EU policy and development that are good for Ireland and the EU while opposing and working to change those policies and developments that are not in our collective interests.  For Sinn Féin this means changing the present course of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Ba mhaith linn bogadh ón treo atá á ghlacadh faoi láthair agus ar a bhfuil an AE ag díriú — an lárnú, an príobháidiú agus an míleatú atá i lár an agenda faoi láthair.  Ba mhaith linn bogadh i dtreo AE níos daonlathhaí, níos sóisialaí agus níos síochánta a cuireann rathúnas agus cothromaíocht do chách chun cinn.  Chomh maith leis na téarmaí tagartha níos leithne a bhí á lorg ag Sinn Féin, bhíomar ag iarraidh go mbeadh plé níos gníomhaí agus díospóireacht níos leithne leis an bpobal a léireodh an réimse tuairimí difriúla ag an Aontas Eorpach a bhí soiléir le linn fheachtas an reifrinn.</p>

Bhí na cruinnithe ar fad i dTeach Laighean, áit le fíorbheagán deis don phobal bheith bainteach leo nó bheith gafa leis an bplé agus gan bhealach ar bith ann le díospóireacht nó plé níos ciallmhaire ná níos poiblí a bheith acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Dhéan Sinn Féin argóint chomh maith gur cóir don fhochoiste taisteal timpeall na tíre chun buaileadh le dreamanna difriúla in ionaid difriúla ar nós leabharlanna poiblí, scoileanna, ollscoileanna, ionaid pobail agus suímh oibre.  Níor tharla sin ach an oiread agus is mór an trua sin.  Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús, is deis caillte í sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">We argued that rather than the adversarial, witness approach the sessions should take the form of an ongoing dialogue.  Unfortunately, all of these proposals were rejected.  As a consequence, the sessions were, on most occasions, simply a re-run of the debates of the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign, involving many of the same well known public faces, with little new content.  Worse still was the inevitable imbalance in the witnesses who attended the sub-committee.  Of the more than 100 individuals who addressed the sub-committee, only a handful were critical of the Lisbon treaty.  While some speakers or organisations did not adopt a formal position either way, the overwhelming majority of those who spoke at the sub-committee were clearly in support of the treaty, despite the fact that the majority of the public voted against it.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Having excluded the general public and selected a panel of speakers that held the Government's view, it is hardly surprising that the sub-committee's official report merely confirmed the Government's position.  The report could have been written by any of the pro-Lisbon treaty parties represented on the sub-committee without having to go through the charade of dozens of sessions over eight weeks.  Sinn Féin did not support the sub-committee's report and instead produced its own report entitled, Majority View, Minority Report — The Future of the EU and Ireland's role in Shaping that Future.  This report sets out in detail the challenges facing Ireland and the European Union and the mechanism we believe could have been used to address the concerns of the electorate on key issues such as maintaining our political strength, protecting neutrality, workers' rights, public services and tax sovereignty.  It is clear that these issues can be addressed only in a new treaty which would include legally binding protocols, not declarations or clarifications which are not worth the paper on which they are written.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">In Sinn Féin's view, the Government and Opposition parties have abused the Oireachtas, cynically manipulating the sub-committee to set the ground for a re-run of the Lisbon treaty referendum.  In so doing they have done a great disservice to the people and the European Union.  The sub-committee could have been an invaluable opportunity to open up a meaningful and wide ranging debate about the future of the European Union and Ireland's place in it.  We could have extended the debate beyond the narrow confines of the Lisbon treaty, a treaty democratically rejected by the electorate, and created a vibrant and forward looking dialogue on the broad range of policy issues involved.  Instead, the Government closed down the debate.  As a result, the sub-committee's official report will add nothing to our understanding of the European Union, the Lisbon treaty or the various options for the future of the Union.  It was a missed opportunity and loaded in a particular direction.  If Members wish, I can supply every Member of the House with our report which was based on the very limited opportunities the sub-committee presented.  Even at this late stage I urge people not to go to the European Council and set themselves against the democratic views of the people and the mandate given in June.</p>

It is a very important debate at a critical moment of Ireland's engagement with the European Union.  I am somewhat disappointed with some of the contributions so far.  I was particularly facilitative in helping to establish the sub-committee in the summer when I spoke to members of the Opposition parties.  I worked particularly hard to facilitate the inclusion of Sinn Féin which made great strides to have a member on the sub-committee.  We were anxious to make it inclusive and included independent Members of the Seanad.  It is a pity that is not even acknowledged.  Sinn Féin states other parties abused the Oireachtas.

          <p eId="para_680">I have been reasonable all along in trying to engage with other political parties.  We have been criticised for not engaging.  The whole purpose of the Oireachtas sub-committee was for the political parties in the House to engage.  Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party, Sinn Féin and the Independents had representatives.  I take it that they were not acting unilaterally from their parties' perspectives or positions.  They engaged with each other to try to put forward a perspective on Ireland in the European Union.  To suggest there has been no engagement since the referendum between the political parties is wrong.  The purpose of the Oireachtas sub-committee was to facilitate active engagement between the political parties with civil society and a variety of interest groups to try to identify key issues for Ireland and the European Union.  It is wrong and unfair to suggest there has been no engagement between political parties.  There has been more engagement between political parties on the European Union in recent months in the House than ever before.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The leadership of all parties picked the members of the sub-committee.  I presume discussions took place between the members of the sub-committee and the members and leaders of their parties on the positions adopted and perspectives on the European Union.  I am mystified by Deputy Kenny's suggestion that there has been no contact.  The whole Oireachtas sub-committee was about contact.  It was about the political parties collectively trying to work through a process and formulate ideas and perspectives on the European Union for the future based on the submissions made and the hearings the sub-committee held.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The report will help us all to find a way forward in a way that respects the will of the people and addresses concerns that arose during the Lisbon treaty referendum debate.  I thank the Chairman, Senator Donohoe; the Vice Chairman, Deputy Dooley, and members of the sub-committee for the effort, commitment and vision they have demonstrated in carrying out this vital work.  They worked very hard in a very tight timeframe.  It is an excellent report.  It is the product of extensive consultations with leading voices in the national and international debate on the future of the European Union.  To the sub-committee's credit, its insights have been developed in a very short timeframe and they command the support of the largest political parties in the State.  It has situated its findings in the political reality that other member states continue to have a strong desire to see the Lisbon treaty enter into force at the earliest possible date.  This desire has intensified in the wake of recent political and economic developments, most notably the unprecedented global financial crisis.  These troubling events will serve again to bring home the centrality of the European Union in enabling Europeans to cope satisfactorily with the many challenges that confront today's world.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The report is written in clear, accessible language.  This is important because it is high time the debate on European Union matters in Ireland and across the Union took place in a language with which people can relate.  This is not a question of removing technical jargon.  It is a far more fundamental issue of building understanding, awareness and trust.  The report correctly recognises that Ireland's ability to defend our interests at European Union level has been affected by the result of the referendum in June and that serious long-term damage will be done if we fail to find a way forward.  We have a continuing need to be part of a successful and effective Union that can promote peace and prosperity across Europe in the years and decades ahead, just as it has so very successfully done for Ireland in the past 35 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">I am delighted there was a focus on solutions in the report's findings.  I agree that at national level we have work to do to improve how we handle European Union decisions and laws.  While greater accountability for EU affairs in the Dáil and Seanad should increase public engagement, in the longer term we need to make a better effort to provide information on the European Union for our children in schools and the public.  What was evident from the research we carried out after the referendum was not just that many knew very little about the content of the Treaty of Lisbon, but that they also knew very little about the operation of the Union.  Tackling this deficit is more than a question of providing information; it is about enhancing the acceptability and the democratic legitimacy of what is done at Union level.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The European Union has a proud history of bringing its member states together in a shared venture designed to serve the interests of the people of Europe.  It is in this spirit that the partners are approaching the Lisbon treaty.  It has faced problems of this nature before and always overcome them.  That must be our determined aim again on this occasion.  No Irish interest would be served by our becoming detached and isolated from our European partners.  As the sub-committee has made clear, our future is best served by retaining a strong commitment to the ideals and objectives of the European Union which have served us so well these past 35 years.  We have a real interest in pursuing reform of the European Union's institutions in order that Ireland can continue to harness the enormous potential of the Union throughout the 21st century.  It is important to realise that the Lisbon treaty is viewed across the Union as an essential component of its capacity to deal with current and future challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">I have held meetings with a great many of my European counterparts in the last few weeks and found a great appreciation and understanding of Ireland and a real wish to respect the democratic choice made by the people last June.  The Government is working on the basis of this goodwill to find a solution which will enable us to move forward with our EU partners in an agreed manner.  Contrary to what Deputy Kenny said, all of the issues are not agreed.  I was surprised by his mentioning this.  For example, there are diverging views on the composition of the Commission.  There were diverging views leading into the Lisbon treaty and there still are.  What we are seeking is something that is not automatic, as has been suggested.  As I said publicly yesterday, these are issues that will go to the wire at the end of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">To return to the point made by Deputy Costello, I said at the Joint Committee on European Affairs that the Government was in a negotiating position with 26 other member states.  The idea of talking out the negotiating process here, two days in advance, when we have to seek agreement with 26 other countries is a little unrealistic.  The Oireachtas has never tied the hands of any democratically elected Government in its negotiating positions with other states.  We know the broad parameters and the sub-committee has identified them also.  We are in a negotiating position and nothing has yet been agreed.  The negotiations will take place on Thursday and Friday and we must have due respect for the positions of the other 26 member states.  I mean no disrespect to any person or party in the House; it is <i>realpolitik</i>, which we should acknowledge.  We are seeking an agreement that will accommodate both the democratically expressed will of the people and the deeply held wish of our fellow member states to implement the reforms incorporated in the Lisbon treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I have followed with great interest the public and media reaction to the work of the sub-committee and the publication of its report.  Its conclusions and recommendations represent an important input into our national approach to the challenges posed by the June referendum result.  Since the results of the Millward Brown research were made available last September, I have been considering ways in which we can improve on how we communicate European Union affairs.  This includes working with the European Commission and the European Parliament on a joint memorandum of understanding which will enable us to work together on this important area.  I have also been considering how the Government can use its resources to deliver more effective and strategic communications on European issues.  It is clear from our research that Irish people remain very positive towards the European Union, but that poor communication and a difficulty in accessing clear, accurate information can create barriers to understanding how it actually works and what it does to advance our interests and collective well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">With regard to the findings of the report on the role of the Oireachtas in European Union affairs and the Oireachtas scrutiny system, I welcome the renewed attention being paid to accountability in EU decision making.  The 13 recommendations contained in the report are imaginative and wide-ranging, particularly with regard to the introduction of a formal scrutiny reserve system.  There are constitutional, legal and resource implications to many of the recommendations which will require careful consideration by the Government.  Nevertheless, I indicate our openness to the report's recommendations which deserve very serious attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_694">I wish to share my time with Deputy Perry.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I do not ever like to speak with certainty in politics, but having listened to the members of Sinn Féin, I can say with certainty that it was never their intention to assist or engage with the sub-committee when they sought to be represented on it.  One of the regrets I have is that we in Fine Gael agreed to their joining the sub-committee because we would have been better off without them.  Sinn Féin spent a political generation trying to sabotage the State and judging by the behaviour of its members on the sub-committee, it is no different now.  They had no interesting in finding a solution; their only interest was in self-promotion.  People bent over backwards for them.  Sinn Féin was facilitated on the sub-committee, as it was at the National Forum on Europe, yet it was the only political party which disowned both the report of the National Forum on Europe and the report of the sub-committee.  There was another Independent member of the sub-committee who did seek to engage with it but also disagreed with the report.  Any fair reading of the report will show that the sub-committee bent over backwards to recognise the views and concerns of the Sinn Féin and Independent members.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The Minister mentioned Deputy Kenny.  There may be a misinterpretation of where Fine Gael is coming from with respect to the sub-committee.  We saw it as a means to engage with the expert witnesses based on the Millward Brown research.  We never saw it as a forum in which to put forward our party view or put our stamp on the findings of the sub-committee.  The Chairman, Deputy Creighton and I never had internal discussions in the party on how we might approach the sub-committee and the expert witnesses.  That was one of the reasons we could, with a clear conscience, launch our own policy suggestions.  I realise it was a sensitive time, and my good friend Deputy Dooley took umbrage, as did Deputy Costello.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_704">I compliment Senator Donohoe on his excellent work and all the Members who attended the sub-committee — Deputies Costello, Dooley and Creighton are present — who put in many long hours and did much hard work.  I acknowledge, in particular, the commitment shown by Deputy Costello.  Many attended the sub-committee, including representatives of the Institute of European Affairs who put in a tremendous amount of work and made very good submissions.  I am sure people will not mind if I single out Dr. Gavin Barrett who attended two or three times.  They made a major commitment which went beyond the call of duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">A couple of clear messages came through from the sub-committee, one of which was that our interests actually had been damaged in the European Union.  There was an overwhelming view that we should remain at the heart of the Union and the covert message coming through was that to do so we should ratify the Lisbon treaty.  We heard all the evidence and if we were a jury, there would be no contest.  There would be no doubt as to the direction we should take, notwithstanding the fact that such a recommendation was not part of the sub-committee's terms of reference.  However, it is important not to lull ourselves into a false sense of security.  That is the danger we face.  The evidence is overwhelming.  One could say to oneself that there is only one possible course of action.  One could think that surely it is what the people want and that is what they will do.  We have thought that in the past and been wrong; we could be wrong in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I have doubts about the research.  A total of 800,000 people voted "No".  Traditionally, in European referendums in Ireland around 500,000 people have voted "No" and always for the same reasons.  Some of them are against the concept of the European Union, while a certain percentage base their "No" vote on concerns about abortion, neutrality and so on.  I do not think we will ever reassure the people concerned.  However, I am concerned about the 300,000 additional "No" voters and those who did not come out to vote.  They are the people to whom we need to address our message.  What were the reasons they voted "No"?</p>
          <p eId="para_707">That is the reason Fine Gael made separate proposals from those made in the report and Deputy Kenny has outlined them to the House.  They were not intended as a means of raising the bar or to create difficulties; rather Fine Gael believes wider concerns other than those issues dealt with in the Lisbon treaty must be addressed.  I refer to the issues outlined by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  With the exception of the Commissioner issue, taxation, neutrality and ethical issues are all catered for in the treaty.  We understand this to be the case.  We are looking for confirmation, to be sure to be sure.  The only matter at issue is that of Commissioner.  We believe other issues can be addressed on the domestic front.  It is not satisfactory just to try to put in place a measure to jump the Lisbon treaty fence, ratify the treaty and move on.  That would be a grave error.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">There is widespread concern that the Constitution is being slowly eaten away.  People are suspicious of the European Union.  I do not share this sentiment but reasonable people are suspicious.   They are of the view that there is no one there to look after their interests.  Fine Gael proposes the taking of a constitutional position which would be the equivalent of a watchdog, an ombudsman or information officer.  We do not believe the resources required for such a post would be significant, particularly as Fine Gael is advocating public sector reform.  We believe it could be done, irrespective of the Lisbon treaty.  I urge the Government to consider this proposal with some others.  I am confident that if it does not do this, it will be part of Fine Gael policy for the European elections and the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The other issues concern enhanced powers for the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny which would cost virtually nothing.  The Oireachtas committee system has to be revamped.  We need to slash the number of committees in half.  There are 25 Oireachtas committees, which is crazy.  I will send the Government a brief on this proposal if it wishes.  The resulting secretariat resources could be given to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny which has a very important role.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">It would require a constitutional referendum for the Government to refer a treaty to the Supreme Court which is always the final arbiter on whether a constitutional referendum is required.  This would apply to future treaties in order that we would know with certainty whether a section might require a constitutional referendum.  In our view the full treaty should be put to a referendum but we need clarity.  At the moment we have people starting with Article 48 and ending up on workers' rights.  They will jump 1,000 places in between to try to create confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">With regard to engagement, Deputy Kenny proposed that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs sit down with him to brief him on the Government's plans.  Fine Gael would be very supportive of any positive measure to ensure we stay at the heart of the European Union.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_712">I congratulate the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union on its work and the report produced under the chairmanship of Senator Paschal Donohoe.  I congratulate all members of the sub-committee and the secretariat on their accomplishment.  I support the broad thrust of the sub-committee's report that Ireland's policy of being a constructive member at the heart of the European Union is the best way to advance its vital interests.  I welcome each and every one of the proposals made on European scrutiny, particularly the proposal that there be a formal scrutiny reserve mechanism.  This mechanism would make the Oireachtas more influential in the negotiating position adopted by Irish Ministers.  The report also proposes a package of measures to improve public and media awareness of the joint committee's important watchdog role regarding new EU legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The core of the current economic crisis lies in the failure of the banks and financial system to anticipate and manage risk.  This failure to manage risk has brought some of the world's biggest corporations to their knees and caused some of them to fail and disappear.  It has been catastrophic for some countries which are now in an appalling position.  Effectively, they bet on a risk they did not understand.  They took a major risk with the economy and the bet failed.  Now they are in a deep crisis from which it may take decades to recover.  It is most important, from the point of view of Ireland, that they must recover from the disaster largely on their own.  I do not think we should bet our economy and the future well-being of the country on the promise that we can muddle our way on our own in some form of a semi-detached or distant relationship with the European Union.  Let us not bet on some unwise form of isolationism.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The report of the sub-committee provides a road map as to where we should direct our attention and energies to ensure the Lisbon treaty, with new reassurances for Ireland, can be ratified.  Our membership of the European Union has been very good for us.  Being at the heart of the Union is where we should be to protect our future.  I commend the report to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_715">I join in congratulating the sub-committee on its report on Ireland's future in the European Union, outlining the challenges and issues faced and opinions expressed.  I also congratulate it on the quality of its hearings which included some appropriately robust exchanges.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs have been exploring sensitively, both internally and with our European partners, ways of identifying and addressing the core concerns of voters which contributed to a rejection of the ratification of the Lisbon treaty last June in order to break the impasse in the European Union which this has created.  At the same time, the swift passage of events and major international problems that have arisen since serve to highlight the value of belonging at the heart of the European Union, without which, as a small sovereign state, we would be even more vulnerable than we are, and also the urgency, from the point of view of our EU partners, of completing the current reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">One point that needs to be better explained is that a treaty ratification process involving 27 member states and requiring unanimity is implicitly a two-stage process.  If the Lisbon treaty were ratified, this would become more explicit.  In the first round, every country's opinion is canvassed, either through its parliament or electorate.  It is not the case that at the first "No" the treaty is dead and that other countries which have not yet done so can or should be stopped from expressing their opinion on the grounds that it is now redundant.  The process is not about brandishing irrevocable vetoes but about trying to find a united way forward which involves accommodating the reservations, concerns and interests of others as well as our own.  If it is obvious from the first round that there is and will be no consensus, which would be surprising, obviously it cannot proceed.  If, on the other hand, there are only two or three countries which have a difficulty, it is sensible to see if the matter can be resolved.  That is what happened in the case of France and the Netherlands when they rejected in referendums the constitutional treaty.  Their concerns were accommodated without unduly upsetting others and they, with the rest, except ourselves, have or will have ratified a modified Lisbon treaty.  Something similar should happen in the case of Ireland, particularly if, as I said, it appears likely that this will be the only country withholding ratification.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">This is an issue we should approach in a spirit of friendship, partnership and co-operation, particularly since we have had, by and large, such a good experience of membership of the European Union in the past 35 years.  We chose not to proceed to vote on the constitutional treaty after the French and Dutch "No" votes and after seven years there is no appetite among our partners to embark on a second renegotiation followed by a third round of ratification.  If any one of us as an individual was a member of a club of 27 that required unanimity to effect a change in the rules, how many of us, if we found ourselves in a minority of one, would insist that our view must prevail and that the other 26 members simply would have to drop their planned rule changes?  If we behaved like that, not merely would we be unpopular but fellow members would not feel inclined to go out of their way to oblige us if we ever found ourselves in difficulty and needed the help and understanding that we had denied them.  There are many voices, some of them shrill, urging us to play hardball or be uncompromisingly rejectionist.  Few, if any of them, have ever sat round the Council table.  It is easy to make unrealistic demands from the outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I believe our European partners are prepared to go a long way to meet our concerns.  If that is the case, we ought to reciprocate and it is in our interests to do so.  If there is one theme that permeates the entire report, it is the loss of influence, goodwill and self-confidence, both real and feared, as a result of our Lisbon treaty vote.  It is not so serious yet because our partners hope and believe the situation can be retrieved.  If that belief were to prove ill-founded, both we and our partners would be forced to conclude that Ireland's attitude and long-standing policy towards the European Union had fundamentally changed.  We would be overturning, at the behest of few Members in the Oireachtas, 35 years of positive and constructive membership of the European Union and retreating to the outer edge, no doubt self-righteously nursing our various wounds and grievances, of which every country has some.  We would simply be treated as not really wanting to be part of the European project anymore.  This would be a tragedy with profound consequences for our political standing in the world, our economic well-being, our national morale and self-confidence and, perhaps, even our long-term viability as a nation state in what is now an ultra-globalised world.  While we should look for whatever guarantees, reassurances and comforts that we can obtain, nothing is a substitute for ensuring we stay at the heart of European Union decision-making, particularly in order that we can shape the response to new situations that cannot always be predicted in advance and protect our interests.  We have to see the wood from the trees.  We have and always will have legitimate interests, preoccupations and concerns.  The issue is whether we can best look after them from within or whether we should listen to siren voices calling on us to step outside.  Do we want to act as a proxy for interests hostile to European integration?  Are we not likely to find ourselves diplomatically marooned without a paddle with all the hopes and confidence of four decades — perhaps they were illusions — cut short?</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Different sectional grasps and interests in this society used the process to advance their agendas at our peril.  Conditionality lost the Lisbon treaty vote and could finally lose us our hard won position at the heart of the European Union, even when that might not have been the intention.  Not one of our concerns, objectively analysed for their substance, or all of them together, are worth paying that price.  The European Union and the United Nations are the fora in which Ireland has taken its place among the nations of the earth.  Countries, like people, need good friends, partners and neighbours.  A relative self-inflicted diplomatic isolation will not make for happiness.  We should make it clear inside and outside the House that we want with our partners to break the impasse in order that all of us in the European Union can move ahead in harmony together.</p>

          <p eId="para_723">I too join others in complimenting the work of all the participants in the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union.  Its chairman, Senator Paschal Donohoe, in particular, did an outstanding job in steering the sub-committee's work in what was an intensive and, sometimes, gruelling endeavour.  Trojan work was put done by my sub-committee colleagues, on which I compliment them.  I agree, however, with Deputy Timmins that Sinn Féin, in particular, had reservations from the start.  It made it clear from day one that it had no intention of subscribing to whatever report was agreed by the sub-committee.  That is unfortunate because it was a constructive exercise into which everyone went with an open mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The report contains a series of worthwhile recommendations.  I hope there will be more of a commitment from the Government benches in implementing some of them, particularly those that involve changes to the EU scrutiny system and how the Oireachtas deals with European affairs.  It is imperative the Government takes them on board, not just considers them, leaving them on a shelf to gather dust.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Despite the positive work and input into the work of the sub-committee, the Government has been somewhat lacklustre in its response to the referendum result in June.  I did not need a sub-committee report to tell me that the consequences of the result for our national interests were devastating.  We face an extremely serious situation but there has been no adequate response from the Government benches.  The response has been more akin to a rabbit caught in headlights.  The Taoiseach, in particular, and certain Ministers have had no response to the crisis.  There has been no reality check or attempt to highlight how grave the implications of the "No" vote are for our national interests.  There has been no reference to the European Union or the aftermath of the Lisbon treaty referendum result for several months, which is alarming.  The only response has been the Minister for Finance blaming the European Central Bank for high interest rates which is unfortunate and symptomatic of the Government's approach to the European Union in the past decade.  The positives are claimed by the Government as successes at a national level; when things go wrong, the buck is passed to the European Union.  That attitude needs to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">We need a clear statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, preferably, or the Taoiseach setting out how the Government wants to change the context and conditions to ensure the Lisbon treaty is ratified.  We all accept this is in the national interest.  It is not about simply shuttling around Europe trying to get agreement on certain issues.  As Deputy Timmins pointed out, we already have clarity on various issues such as taxation and neutrality.  The Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties and the Seville Declaration after the first Nice treaty referendum result have stated the EU position on Ireland's neutrality.  We need a more radical and fundamental approach.  The Minister should take on board on some of Deputy Kenny's points.  It is not just about reaching agreement at EU level about our neutrality but examining the incorporation of safeguards in the Constitution.  We must also examine safeguarding the personal rights enshrined in Articles 40 to 44, inclusive.  The sub-committee's report referred to this and it merits further consideration.  Declarations — window-dressing — are not adequate in their own right.  If the Government is delusional enough to think so, I am fearful, as a committed and passionate European, that a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty will go the same way as the first.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_727">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important subject.  However, I must point out to Members on all sides of the House that a five-minute speech is hardly sufficient in dealing with Ireland's future in the European Union.  It is appalling that we are reduced to this time allocation.  Some Members will not even get to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">As Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I compliment Senator Paschal Donohoe and the members of the sub-committee on the work they did in difficult circumstances within tight time constraints.  I hope its report will resonate with the Minister and the Government and that there will be a significant response which will lift the debate on Ireland's participation in the European Union back to the level it once held.  Every leader of the country since 1973 has been steadfastly in favour and thoroughly supportive of Ireland's membership of the European Union and full participation in it.  In more recent years we have adopted the policy of seeking possible opt-outs, declarations and clauses.  It is no harm to remind the House that every time one seeks an opt-out one moves further from the centre.  Denmark did it a few years ago, having previously been at the centre of the European Union.  It was much feared by its competitors, especially in the food producing sector.  No longer is it such; now it is having second thoughts and is trying to come back into the circle again.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">We must ask ourselves where it went wrong.  Irreparable damage has already been done.  If the treaty is not passed before the European elections, further, more serious damage will be done.  There are those who say it cannot happen before then.  If not, it will be too late for the country.  Many recognise that the damage done by the failure to ratify the treaty has significance for the country, socially, politically and economically.  The conspiracy theorists have been running around the country for the past six months, with the abortion, lack of sovereignty and erosion of neutrality theorists.  This is rubbish and nonsense that has been discussed hundreds of times in the House and at European level.  On the participation of the Defence Forces in European battle groups which suddenly are so reprehensible to some, the Defence Forces have been pariticipating and serving outside the country with distinction for the past 50 years.  Only now there is the triple lock mechanism proposal to ensure we do the right thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">It would have been helpful if senior members of the Government had at least read the Lisbon treaty before the referendum and publicly pronounced that they had done so.  It would have been a help to those in favour of it.  This has been mentioned to me at several meetings I have attended all over Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I have been a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs for 24 or 25 years.  In all my time I have never seen Ireland in a more precarious position.  The Minister and the Government have a serious task.  If we think the economic difficulties we face are the biggest we ever will face, let us see what will happen if we are pushed further to the outskirts of the European Union.  The European Union ship will continue to sail whether the Irish shout "Stop".  The ship has moved and we have been left standing on the shore.  Unless we find a punt to get back on board before the European elections in June, it will be too late.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_732">I thank the Minister for affording me some of his time.  I wish both him and the Taoiseach well in their endeavours during the week.  I recognise the work done in recent months in dealing with other administrations and member states.  There is an understanding emerging that this is an easy effort and that the two lads only need to show up to get what they want.  In particular, there is the notion that all member states will have a Commissioner.  My understanding is that that is far from the case and that anything that will be achieved in any areas in which we have sought to try to find a compromise will be hard fought for and may not be achieved in the short term.  We must bear this in mind in view of the consensus emerging.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">I recognise the tremendous efforts made by the Chairman, Senator Donohoe, the secretariat and members to produce the report on time.  I was delighted to be a member of the sub-committee.  It was important for us to understand that the decision of the people on 12 June had to be accepted and respected.  It was right for the Oireachtas to assess the impact of that decision and try to understand why the majority of people had voted "No".  It was necessary to delve deeper into the reasons for the "No" vote, particularly because the Eurobarometer and Millward Brown research suggested Irish people wanted to remain at the heart of the European Union or, as I see it, the inside track.  It was necessary to understand why they had made their decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The report sought to establish if the wish of the people to have Ireland remain to the fore in the European Union was compatible with the rejection of the reform process the Lisbon treaty had sought to deliver.  At the end of our deliberations over a period of seven weeks, the answer was an emphatic no, that it was not compatible and that it would not be possible to remain at the heart of the European Union if we refused to accept the reform process as set out.  It was well established that the result of our rejection of the Lisbon treaty had affected our influence in the Union.  The "No" vote inhibits Ireland's ability to promote and defend its national interests and affects its ability to influence key upcoming decisions on climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">We recognise the difficulties we will have in setting up a farm package through reform of the agri-budget beyond 2013.  In the past couple of days I was heartened to hear the comment of Dr. Patrick Wall, chairman of the management board of the European Food Safety Authority, that the "No" vote in the Lisbon treaty referendum had had an impact on the work being done, particularly when German colleagues had questioned him on the reasons the Irish people would want to be congratulated by the neo-Nazis on the way they had voted.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  The Government has been working extremely hard since the decision was made on the Lisbon treaty.  We commissioned quantitative and qualitative research.  We facilitated and worked with other parties to establish the Oireachtas sub-committee.  To suggest nothing was done, as Deputy Creighton has done, is wrong.  The Fine Gael Party has an honourable tradition of being pro-European Union and has always had the Union as part of its core policy platform.  I have a sense that in recent times during the Lisbon treaty campaign and now it is a greater priority to criticise the Government rather than advance a unified approach to the European Union.</p>

          <p eId="para_741">Fine Gael did not do so; neither did the Government.  There are still doubts.  We are trying to reflect the will of the people.  It is clear from the research that issues of neutrality and defence, with workers' rights, are high on people's list of priorities.  We must listen to the people.  We must create solutions with our European colleagues that reflect the will of the people, as articulated at the ballot box.  We must not take things for granted.  Whether we like it, we must take messages from the way the people voted.  As legislators and politicians, it is our challenge to reflect these views in a new road map.  That is what we are endeavouring to do with our colleagues in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, in an eloquent and good contribution to this debate are worth bearing in mind.  We are 35 years in the European Union.  Other member states have clear views on the Lisbon treaty, its value and the purpose of the reform programme.  If we can deal with the issues raised in a satisfactory solution, can we work with our colleagues to advance the reform programme to make the European Union more effective on the global stage on issues such as climate change and the banking and financial crisis?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was loud in his praise of the ECB in terms of its role in supporting the Irish banking system in the past 12 months.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_747">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_748">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p eId="para_749">notes with concern that inflation in Ireland remains higher than the eurozone average and noting in particular that the ex-tax price of diesel, petrol and home heating oil is 10% to 20% higher than the EU average;</p>
          <p eId="para_750">notes the Government's failure to rein in price increases created directly by Government Departments and agencies (for example, prescription drugs, accident and emergency, school transport and hospital charges) or sanctioned by regulators (for example, the Commission for Energy Regulation; the Taxi Regulator and the National Roads Authority), and concerned at the impact that these increases will have on consumers; and</p>
          <p eId="para_751">notes with concern that many consumers are travelling to Northern Ireland or overseas to purchase goods and services;</p>
          <p eId="para_752">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p eId="para_753">reverse the decision to increase the higher rate of VAT in the budget;</p>
          <p eId="para_754">freeze Government charges and levies imposed on businesses and consumers;</p>
          <p eId="para_755">require regulatory organisations to hold public hearings prior to decision on price increases; and</p>
          <p eId="para_756">outlaw surcharges imposed by retailers on credit cards, debit cards, direct debits and e-payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I wish to share time with Deputies Joe McHugh, John O'Mahony, Seymour Crawford, Frank Feighan and Joe Carey.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Ireland is deep in recession with 100,000 people losing their jobs in the past year and perhaps the same number will lose theirs in the year to come.  Incomes are stagnant for most people and take home pay will reduce next year, largely as a result of the tax increases introduced in the budget.  Inflation is beginning to fall and it is likely to fall much further in the coming months but that does not mean issues such as rip offs, value for money and consumer protection are unimportant.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">As people's incomes reduce and household budgets are squeezed, consumer issues and value for money become more important.  We tabled the motion in this context.  It states, "Dáil Éireann notes with concern that inflation in Ireland remains higher than the eurozone average and noting in particular that the ex-tax price of diesel, petrol and home heating oil is 10% to 20% higher than the EU average".  The consumer price index outlines our inflation rate but the HIPC rate has levelled off and is slightly below that.  The motion further notes the Government's failure to rein in price increases created directly by Departments and agencies, for example, in the cost of prescription drugs, accident and emergency, school transport and hospital charges, to which I will refer later.  It is particularly relevant in the context of the Government's amendment which "recognises the Government's commitment to tackling inflation in areas over which it has direct influence".  I look forward to refuting that later.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">We are concerned at the impact the increases will have on consumers and the motion notes with concern that many of them are travelling to Northern Ireland or overseas to purchase goods and services.  We call on the Government to take action in this regard, first, by reversing the decision to increase VAT in the budget; second, by freezing charges and levies imposed on business and consumers; third, by requiring regulatory bodies to hold public hearings prior to making decisions on price increases; and, fourth, by outlawing surcharges imposed by retailers on credit and debit cards and e-payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">In tabling the motion, Fine Gael seeks to draw the attention of the public to the failure of Government to pursue the pro-consumer policies and pro-competition polices that it promised.  Almost two years ago, the consumer strategy group made 27 recommendations to Government.  To date, only nine have been fully implemented while four are in train.  In the case of another 14, or more than half, nothing has been done.  When it comes to reports produced by the Competition Authority, the position is similar. Reports on barriers to competition in transport, casual trading, engineering, insurance, banking, health insurance, architecture, optometry, the legal profession and dentistry have been published in recent years and, by and large, they have been ignored and not implemented by the Government and its agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">In recent years, the Government has been the driving force behind inflation.  Inflation on Government provided and regulated services has run at double the average rate of inflation.  The relentless increase in Government-imposed prices has continued unabated.  In recent months we have been subjected to massive increases in the price of electricity and gas, despite the significant fall in commodity prices.  The cost of electricity reduced by 1% when these increases should have been reversed.  Other regulators have got in on the act with the Taxi Regulator increasing fares by more than 8%, even though the vast majority of drivers who made submissions requested no increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The key question is where Ministers stand on this.  The Government amendment "recognises the Government's commitment to tackling inflation in areas over which it has direct influence".  The Minister for Health and Children increased accident and emergency charges by 10% in 2008 but that was not enough and she will increase them by 52% next month.  Overnight fees for private patients in public hospitals will increase by 20% in the same month while public patients face a 14% hike.  Potentially there may not be inflation next year.  This increase equates to infinity times the rate of inflation.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is also in on the act by increasing the fee new Irish citizens must pay on naturalisation.  It is presumably part of Deputy Conor Lenihan's integration policy to tax people when they become citizens.  The fee will increase by 50% from €684.70 to €950.  The Minister for Transport has allowed CIE to increase fares by 5% and Luas by 4.2% to meet the cost of the pay deal and to take account of the reduction in the number of people travelling on public transport as a result of the recession and emigration.  When every other company in the economy loses business, it does not increase prices.  Hotels in Dublin are offering major discounts this week and next week.  That is how industries and State companies should respond to a downturn.  However, the Government's view on this is very different.  Even the Minister for Defence has got in on the act, increasing the cost of a cruise on board <i>The Asgard II </i>by 15%.</p>

          <p eId="para_767">Every Minister who has direct control over inflation has taken the opportunity to increase prices by between five times inflation and infinity times inflation.  We should give the Government amendment the respect it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Retailers, professionals and businesses, large and small, are not to blame for price increases in recent years.  They are only responding to the example set by Ministers, State agencies and regulators and, in many cases, they have passed on to consumers the increases the Government has imposed on them in rates, taxes and utility charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">In the coming weeks, Fine Gael will relaunch its Rip-Off Ireland campaign.  As part of that campaign, we will put forward a series of measures to reduce the cost of living and strengthen consumer protection, among which will be the reversal of the 0.5% increase in VAT.  This is a big mistake and it will not bring in more revenue nor will the 50 cent increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes or the increase in capital gains and capital acquisitions taxes.  Contrary to the Minister for Finance, I anticipate revenue in all these areas will reduce next year and the Government's tax increases are counterproductive.  Instead of increasing taxes, the Government should pare back day-to-day spending.  While some people may believe the Government is engaged in spending restraint, that is not the case.  It has cut the capital budget and day-to-day spending will increase by 7% or €3 billion next year.  That should not happen and the Government should not use tax increases to pay for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The Government should reverse its plans to increase charges and levies to help restore stability to the economy and confidence to the business sector and consumers.  We also need a major pro-consumer reform of the regulatory structure for energy and communications.  Instead of taking written submissions, the regulators should hold oral hearings on proposed price increases similar to those held in Canada and America.  The energy regulator has made a start in this regard but none of the other regulators has.  The formula for calculating price increases should be published in order that we can see how the regulators justify increases.  A level playing field is needed between consumers on one side and producers on the other.  Producers can approach any regulator for a price increase but consumers do not have a mechanism by which they can petition him or her for a price decrease.  That should change.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The Minister for Finance should use the payments services directive, which will be transposed into Irish law next year, to outlaw surcharges imposed on people using efficient means of payment such as credit cards, debit debits and e-payments.  It should not be legal to surcharge for these types of payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The Tánaiste should amend the Consumer Protection Act to outlaw expiry dates on vouchers.  This is particularly relevant at this time of year.  As Christmas approaches people will spend hundreds of millions on vouchers.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">The Government has adopted our policy of merging the National Consumer Association with the Competition Authority and I welcome this decision.  However, it is important that the sum of the two parts of these agencies should be greater than the whole.  I would like this new agency to have an expanded role.  It should represent consumers in the social partnership process as they are not properly represented in it at present.  The new body should be given the role of ensuring that tax decreases and increases are not used by retailers and service providers as an excuse to increase prices or not to decrease prices as the case may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The new agency may also have a role in monitoring currency fluctuations.  There is great concern at present among the public that the effect of the fall in the value of sterling is not being passed on to them in terms of lower prices.  I understand it is not as straightforward as this and that other factors are involved, such as different costs of doing business and different tax rates and the fact that people bought their products many months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">A couple of points in the Government's amendment are amusing.  The Government commends itself for the prudent management of the economy.  Not even its supporters who are not members of Fianna Fáil believe it has been prudent.  They may defend the Government but they certainly will not state it has been prudent.  I do not think a single commentator, economist or international body will state the Government has been prudent.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I already mentioned the point about tackling inflation on which the Government has direct control.  The Government commends itself for its continued investment in the NDP but it has cut spending on the NDP by €1 billion this year.  The motion welcomes the fact that the energy regulator has not increased the price of gas and electricity.  This is not good enough.  It also commends the Government on its 25% target for reducing the burden of regulation on business.  However, as we all know it has not worked out what 100% is so how can it cut it by 25% if it still has not worked out what the base line cost of regulation is in Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The rip-off is alive and well in Ireland.  Falling inflation in 2009 must not be used as an excuse for further increases in Government charges and Government regulated prices.  In 2009 we will continue to prosecute the Government when it comes to rising prices, rip-off and consumer protection and we will continue to put forward positive suggestions in this regard.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">The Tánaiste wants to distract from the serious argument and challenges with regard to what is happening in our part of the world and which is affecting the economy as a whole.  We have been monitoring the situation through the media but travelling southwards from Donegal today I did not need the media.  We have plenty of anecdotal evidence that there is a mass migration of people to Northern Ireland to shop.  In years to come there will be sociological analysis of this and it will mention people who perhaps have never been to Northern Ireland in terms of going on a shopping trip and this will be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">It is important that we have continued movement of people over and back across the Border.  The problem at present is that it is one way traffic and this is for a number of reasons.  There is a sterling-euro differential and we are in the geographical position of being the only eurozone country with a land border to sterling.  We are in an invidious situation in terms of the currency differential.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">We should examine tax harmonisation in the context of our capacity and responsibility in the North-South ministerial mechanisms.  I am not discussing an ideal world and <i>quid pro quo</i>.  I know the realities of two separate jurisdictions and Finance Ministries.  However, we all, North and South, bought into the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  It is an extensive document and the Tánaiste is familiar with it.  She attends North-South ministerial meetings.  There is an aspect regarding integrated tax harmonisation in the document.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">At present, we face moving away rather than coming close.  Our VAT rate has increased by 0.5% and I commend my party for seeing this as a problem.  It will be problematic for our economy.  There is a 6.5% differential because Alastair Darling MP has decreased the UK VAT rate to 15%.  This is a problem for one reason, which is perception.  People will mass migrate to the North on the basis that they will get value for money because of a lower VAT rate.  This VAT rate is on white goods and not necessarily on all consumables but there is a perception.  This Saturday, buses will leave from Tralee and Donegal and cars will travel to shop in the North.  This is not necessarily good for Northern Ireland.  Certainly, it is not good for our jurisdiction because it is pulling the people out in large numbers.  In Strabane many small businesses are suffering because of the dominance of the major multiples.  Asda may benefit in Strabane but many businesses will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">The two regional economies which are struggling economically should  be examined.  We are not different from many other regions in the eurozone but our two regional economies have the capacity and opportunity to work more closely together in terms of sharing resources and get away from the idea that we are in constant competition.  Competition will only work effectively on a level playing field.  At present, we do not have a level playing field and this is a problem we must address.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">In a recent article Peter Sheridan, the new CEO of Co-operation Ireland, acknowledged that while we have a peace settlement, a peace process and integrated institutions we still have a long way to go.  Many people have yet to see the peace dividend and we must be careful with the language we use with regard to going North and going South.  In the Dáil, members of the Tánaiste's party have stated that we must be patriotic and not go to Newry and stay away from Strabane.  This is not an argument.  As the Tánaiste knows, many people from our part of the world have traditionally and historically gone across the Border to the fourth largest city, Derry.  Equally, we have had a traditional and historical movement of people from the North down South.  We must watch the language in this debate.  However, we must examine the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement as to how we can integrate our peoples.  Somebody from Letterkenny who wants to buy a white goods appliance knows that if it is worth €1,000, there will be a €60 differential.  We have a problem and must do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Where do we go as an economy?  We find ourselves with a major problem in terms of getting people to spend.  There are constraints.  The banks tell us that they have money to lend and do not need capitalisation but people cannot get money.  We have challenges but the only way to do this is collectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The weekend press contained a quote from the Tánaiste.  There is no denying that retailers are seriously struggling.  The least desirable development for them would be to be caught up in accusations, that is, to be seen as the culprit in terms of driving up prices.  Many retailers in the South purchase cosmetics, for example, from suppliers in the United Kingdom.  While Northern Ireland retailers are purchasing goods from these suppliers in sterling, their counterparts in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Dublin are purchasing in euro.  Thus, the latter are immediately at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The only retailers that are having a field day and laughing all the way to the bank are the multiples.  At the Letterkenny branch of Tesco, for instance, €80,000 worth of goods which had not been sold were loaded onto a lorry and brought across the Border to a Tesco branch in Derry.  The multiples are not losing out in the current situation and political action must be taken to challenge them in this regard.  I was pleased to receive confirmation today that the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has agreed to my request to invite representatives of the multiples to appear before a meeting of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">We must instil confidence in consumers.  Times are tight and people are struggling, with many losing their jobs.  However, there are people with money to spend, but they are afraid to do so.  The irony is that they are afraid to spend money in their own jurisdiction but are getting on buses as far south as Tralee, County Kerry to travel to Belfast to shop.  We must address these major contradictions in the public psyche.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">In regard to efforts to revitalise the economy, Deputy Varadkar has set out the difficulties in terms of our cost base.  The Minister will agree that there are significant pressures on our services sector arising from health and safety regulations, particularly in regard to requirements for kitchens and other facilities.  This country has been destroyed by excessive regulation, not least in regard to the farming sector, as we discussed earlier today.  There is too much red tape and too many associated costs for businesses.  In addition, the minimum wage is set to increase next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">As a result, small businesses face serious difficulties.  If the VAT price differential between North and South remains at 6.5%, there is a prediction within the small retail sector that projected job losses in the sector will increase from 26,000 to 36,000 within the first three months of 2009.  Small business owners are looking to the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to offer some type of fig leaf to encourage people to spend.  Alistair Darling is doing so in the United Kingdom.  We cannot say whether this type of initiative will be successful but it must be done because we are staring into the abyss.  I am confident that progress will be made if we can instil confidence in the pubic to start spending, thus getting money moving again in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">A shift to thrift is not an option.  We cannot allow increasing numbers of people to decide to put their money in biscuit tins under the bed or mattress.  I have heard of people putting their cash in cavity walls.  The Minister has an obligation and duty to take action.  She has heard the litany of crazy costs in terms of the barriers to competition.  Nothing is being done to instil confidence in consumers.  The Minister must act on her obligation in this regard extremely quickly.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_798">I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to the Fine Gael motion.  I thank our spokesperson, Deputy Varadkar, for bringing it before the House.  Many people are concerned about the economic challenges facing them, but the plight of our consumers, and the businesses that supply them, is at the top of the list.  The plain people of Ireland, who are already dealing with spending cuts in education, health and agriculture, have also been hit in their pockets as a result of the increases imposed in the budget and the ill thought out and short-sighted policies of the Government.  Instead of stimulating the economy, these policies are crippling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">In recent weeks, our neighbours in Britain announced a VAT rate reduction of 2.5%, from 17.5 % to 15%, in an effort to stimulate their economy and encourage spending.   We have gone in the opposite direction and increased the VAT rate, with the result that the differential between the two states has increased from 3.5% to 6.5%.  This one change alone has made it more difficult, if not impossible, for small businesses in particular to compete with their counterparts  in the North.  It has led to an exodus of shoppers north of the Border, at great inconvenience to those concerned, which is crippling businesses in the South.  The VAT increases also mean that businesses are paying increased transport charges to get their goods to shops.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">There have been calls on businesses in this jurisdiction to drop their prices in an effort to stop this outflow, but they need help to do so.  Both consumers and businesses are being hit from all sides by Government charges.  It was confirmed recently that Government service charges are now running at ten times the rate of inflation.  This gives the lie to the claim that all our economic problems have arisen because of global developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">It is easy to understand why consumers are infuriated that they are still paying €1 for a litre of petrol or diesel when the price of a barrel of oil has dropped from $147 to less than $40.  Increased taxi fares are in place since November even though the price of oil is tumbling and taxi drives did not even seek these increases.   One taxi driver told me last week that he and his colleagues would be before the courts if they did not implement the increase in fares.  Instead of encouraging more people to use public transport, as is the Government's stated aim, the Minister for Transport has sanctioned increases in bus and train fares, despite falling fuel prices, to help meet the cost of the pay deal and a reduction in public transport usage because of the recession.  Instead of stimulation, the Government is encouraging stagnation.  Why is the pre-tax price of petrol in Ireland 24% higher than the European Union average, with corresponding figures for diesel and home heating oil of 18% and 19%, respectively?  My colleague, Deputy Bruton, pointed out last week that these gaps in prices are costing Irish consumers €30 million per month.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Before coming into the Chamber to speak on this motion, I received a telephone call from a member of the chamber of commerce of a town in Mayo.  He told me of the visits he paid to local businesses today, of the apprehension and fear for the future on the part of business owners as sales figures continue to tumble.  They have lost confidence as they see customers either not spending or travelling to the North to shop.  It is a hollow gesture to ask people to be patriotic when they are not getting the help and stimulus they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">What is needed is leadership from the Government.  When faced with a similar crisis in the United States in the 1930s, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt opted to invest in public projects in an effort to restore confidence.   We all know that confidence is a strange animal.  In all walks of life, it helps people to think and behave differently.  The Government must restore confidence in the business sector.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_804">I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participating in this debate.  She is no stranger to the difficulties experienced in Border areas and she is also in a position to do something about them.  Whether we like it or not, consumers are travelling north of the Border to shop.  Like the Minister, I would like to encourage them to be patriotic.  However, one need only look at the photographs in the newspapers and hear the stories about what is happening to know that this call has fallen on deaf ears.  Perhaps the photographs of the queues on the road to Newry will persuade some people not to do the same.  However, it is a reality.  When one considers that the shops in Enniskillen had to lock their doors while the shops in Cavan had no customers, it is frightening.  What will happen?  Jobs will be lost.  In addition, income will drop.  The Minister will say, as the former Deputy Garret FitzGerald said previously, that there is no VAT on food.  I recall the Minister's late predecessor, the great footballer from Cavan, the late Mr. John Wilson, responding on the radio and television a few minutes after Garret made that comment.  Garret had to rue it and we lost that election.  However, they were different people in different times, although the issue has not changed.  I still remember what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Towns such as Newry, Portadown, Belfast and Enniskillen are crowded with shoppers but I wish to pay tribute to my local SuperValu shop in Monaghan town and all the SuperValu stores in the area.  They came together and bought biscuits, Cadbury's Roses and the like, items I like to buy for my friends.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">I will be expecting some.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_332">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_807">They are much cheaper than in Northern Ireland because they went about their business in the right way.  It is important to see people making an effort.  However, the smaller shops are in dire straits.  The big multiples can make money on either side of the Border and are not too worried.  They will balance their books, which is all they want.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">Even at this late stage, the Government can do something about this problem.  It increased VAT by 0.5%.  We had shown the Government how it could decrease the rate by 1% only a few months earlier but it laughed at us.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown, however, could decrease the VAT rate by 2.5%.  That differential is massive.  I urge the Minister to examine this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The energy situation is a joke.  We have a so-called regulator who is independent of the House and no longer answerable to Members.  Despite the price of oil falling through the floor, he has increased the price of petrol and gas.  It is a joke.  A constituent visited my clinic a few days ago.  She is a very ill lady who is dependent on gas for central heating and cooking but she can no longer afford to pay the bill.  She has now reverted to gas heaters.  She puts on one bar of the heater and sits with that.  As she suffers from asthmatic problems, this is the worst thing she can do but she cannot afford anything else.  I beg the Minister to use the great position she holds to do something about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Finally, the health issue is a joke, with problems in the service increasing.  However, look at what is happening in Northern Ireland.  A Minister has taken the issue in hand, seen where cuts could be made and improved the service in a very short time.  We could learn from that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_811">I welcome this important debate.  The Minister comes from a very different background from mine.  She has a political background, whereas I have a business background.  Political futures are uncertain but the future for small business is certain.  It consists of turning the key in the door.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">I am from a town like any other small town.  It had pubs, shoe shops, newsagents, butchers and so forth.  Most of the people in those premises worked up to 70 hours per week, with barely a return.  My business in Boyle will be 100 years old next year and I am just keeping it going for family pride and the fact that my mother, who is 80 years old, has worked in the shop for 65 years.  From the outside the business appears to be making money, but it has been losing money in the last two or three years because of high costs and rates.  I have a very dedicated and honest staff but the business will not survive unless I invest in it.  Today I went to the Revenue Commissioners to pay €3,700 in VAT, which was two or three weeks late.  I had to take the money out of my own account.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">That is happening throughout the country.  The Revenue Commissioners eventually will close down businesses.  Granted the money is owed but the businesses do not have the money.  However, there is a pride among the businesses.  They have used up most of their cash reserves and in the next six months many more of them will go to the wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Look at what is happening as a result of the VAT changes in Northern Ireland.  I can point to the experience of two ladies who left Manorhamilton to go shopping.  One went to Enniskillen while the other went to Sligo.  One went to Asda and Marks and Spencers.  She spent an hour trying to park her car.  Eventually when she could not she returned to Manorhamilton.  Her friend who went to Sligo was back within an hour.  There is a frenzy and the Government has done nothing to avert it.  Unless something is done, we will be left with just bookmakers' premises and hairdressing salons on the streets of our small towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">My mother has worked all her life.  If the clothes shop closes, she will probably get the pension and some social welfare payment.  She does not wish to do that, like most of the proud shopkeepers and business people throughout this country.  They have been hammered by this Government for the last 11 years.  They have not been protected.  The sooner something is done for them the better.  These are the people who invest in their communities, schools, sports clubs and so forth.  If they go, there will be nobody to take up the slack.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">This issue is about customer loyalty.  It is also about the Government not hammering small businesses, as has happened in the last 11 years.  There must be some protection for these businesses to ensure they can prosper.  They will not prosper in the next six months.  When they close their doors the social welfare system will have to pick up the tab.  That is already happening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_817">On the radio news last Monday I listened with interest to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform speaking from his constituency of Louth about the dramatic increase in cross-Border shopping.  It reminded me of King Canute trying to keep the waves back.  Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his colleagues really believe that people are travelling these distances without having established the benefits?  The addition of 0.5% to our VAT rate and the subsequent reduction to 15% of the VAT rate in the UK has introduced a significant 6.5% difference in the price of products.  That is before our rip-off economy is even factored in.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Anybody who shops in one of the large department stores in Ireland where dual pricing is used can see that goods are significantly more expensive here than elsewhere in the eurozone or in the UK, even when the euro is converted to sterling.  From a consumer's point of view, the price of oil and its associated products offers a good example of how they are being ripped off.  From January to early August the price of crude oil increased from $100 a barrel to a peak of $147 a barrel.  According to the AA, the average price of a litre of petrol increased from €1.18 to €1.33 and the price of a litre of diesel increased from €1.19 to €1.43 over the same period.  Throughout that time one would hear in the early morning news how the price of the barrel of oil had increased.  Day by day prices at the petrol pumps rocketed.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Since August, the price of a barrel of oil has plummeted to approximately $40.  However, the rate of decrease passed on to the consumer has been abysmal.  Getting the industry to react has been like pulling teeth.  We have heard every excuse as to why prices cannot come down.  Undoubtedly, there has been vicious profiteering during this debacle and the Irish consumer is the victim.  There has been no reaction from Government</p>
          <p eId="para_820">It is my understanding that, to a large extent, the function of regulators has been to ensure the provision of a better or even guaranteed level of service to the Irish public.  Energy, taxi, aviation and financial regulators are often on our airwaves reminding us in advertisements of the role they are fulfilling on our behalf.  The recent banking crisis has shown that these organs of the State must be studied.  Basic questions must be asked of these bodies to determine how effective they are.  These questions include asking how much of their budgets is spent on consultancy fees, advertising and promotion.  Answers to these questions would give a good indication as to the effectiveness of these bodies.  This process is long overdue and the practice of establishing and staffing these bodies with people from industry should be closely examined.  At a minimum, a statutory requirement should be imposed on regulators to accept submissions from members of the public before approving price increases and to explain subsequently the basis of such decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The basic point being made in the motion is that the Government is not a detached body in economic matters.  It must spend less time seeking to pass on blame and face up to its responsibilities, measure its response towards the consumer and, above all, refrain from referring to or calling for patriotic action.  It would do well to remember the refrain that action speaks louder than words.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">supports the Government's efforts in providing value for money for consumers and supporting the Irish retail sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I will share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">In welcoming the opportunity to address the House, I wish to specifically mention three major themes, namely, prudent management of the economy, investing in people and reform where needed.  The Government is managing the economy prudently, strategically and with foresight.  We are investing in people and business by building up capacity, skills and business infrastructure.  We are tackling reform where it is needed by cutting red tape, eliminating inefficiencies and giving better value for money to the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Despite the severe economic challenges we face, entrepreneurs and established businesses are making investments now which will provide significant jobs and growth potential for the future.  Since the beginning of November alone, the IDA has made announcements which are expected to provide a total of 1,000 new jobs in a variety of sectors, across a range of skills and spread throughout the country.  This is a strong, real vote of confidence in our economy.  Investors see Ireland as a very good place to do business.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Much has been made of our cost structure.  Ireland is no longer a low cost economy.  We have come a long way and can now ensure that a high and rising standard of living can be achieved by our population.  The United Nations human development index ranks Ireland fifth in terms of quality of life out of 177 countries.  Achieving a good quality of life is ultimately the goal of our policies to maintain and strengthen our competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">A welcome factor has been the easing off in the inflation rate.  Figures for November to be released shortly will show that this trend is continuing, with price pressures in Ireland levelling off.  Ireland's cost competitiveness is also supported by relatively low taxes on labour and enterprise.  Lowering costs and easing demand will assist the economy in regaining cost competitiveness, especially for our internationally trading sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">We face substantial competition from other countries for everything.  Competing on price alone is no longer an option.  For this reason, we are moving to develop sustainable competitive advantage which reflects this reality.  This is based on increasing productivity and stimulating innovation.  In addition, there are other means of stimulating the economy.  The Government is providing a long-term fiscal stimulus through NDP capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, which is twice the average in the European Union.  This fiscal stimulus will not only support jobs in the short term but will also add to our long-term productive capacity and competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The Government is working with the social partners on the issue of inflation during this period of unprecedented change.  All parties are agreed on the critical importance of tackling inflation and ensuring inflation rates are maintained at or below the eurozone average to secure jobs and protect living standards.  I welcome the recent fall in our inflation rate and I am pleased to point out that in the October annual inflation figures from Eurostat, Ireland had the fourth lowest inflation rate in the euro area.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Concern with the loss of cost competitiveness in recent years should not obscure the fact that other factors which have underpinned our competitiveness and made Ireland an attractive location for investment during the period of rapid growth remain in place.  Recent international rankings include the Lisbon Council's European jobs and growth monitor which ranks Ireland the second most competitive economy in Europe in 2008.  Ireland ranks 11th out of 82 countries in the <i>Economist </i>business environment ranking for the period 2008 to 2012 and seventh out of 181 countries in the World Bank’s ease of doing business 2009 ranking.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Other advantages which we have developed over the years include favourable demographics; a skilled and flexible workforce; a business-friendly taxation regime; a "light touch" regulatory environment; a developed capacity, arising from the openness of our economy, to identify and exploit opportunities in international markets; and agility and flexibility in responding to global conditions and business needs.  I am aware, however, that we must develop new sources of competitiveness, particularly in the accumulation and exploitation of knowledge and enhancement of our skills base.  To this end, we are looking to the longer term and have made unprecedented levels of investment in science, infrastructure and skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The competitiveness model Ireland has to follow is one where innovation, talent and flexibility are our acknowledged core competences.  We have a number of key policies which I will outline, drawing particular attention to our investment in research and development, successful foreign direct investment policies and supports to foster export led growth, improving the business environment and widening and deepening the skills of our people.  I will also propose to discuss the services sector as it is one of the success stories of recent economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Ireland continues to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries and is currently ranked the tenth highest exporter of services in the world.  In the years immediately ahead, innovation in services will be a key driver of performance and competitive advantage not only in services industries, but in the economy as a whole.  The very size of the services sector means services innovation can have a greater leveraged value across the entire economy.  Higher productivity and product quality can act to counterbalance costs for firms.  The enterprise development agencies under my Department — Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Industrial Development Agency and the county and city enterprise boards — have a capital allocation of €495 million in 2009, which will be spent on productivity enhancing investments such as research and development, innovation, better use of ICT, and training and management development.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I will now discuss our work, through IDA Ireland, in fostering the growth and development of business and employment.  Over the past decade our success has consistently demonstrated that Ireland's peripheral geographical location was not a barrier to attracting foreign investment and we continue to punch above our weight in attracting the highest value new foreign investment, even in the current economic climate.  The strong flow of substantial new research and development investments by knowledge-based multinational companies demonstrates that Ireland is a major global competitor for research and development and services innovation activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The IBM global location trends annual report in October 2008 ranks Ireland tenth overall for attracting foreign direct investment and fourth for attracting service jobs.  Ireland is also one of the top performers, at third place, for attracting research and development investment.  There have been several announcements of strong investment by firms in recent days.  Today, Aon Corporation announced a significant first of its kind research and development investment for Ireland in the financial services sector, which will create 100 highly skilled jobs.  Synopsys announced on 8 December that it will expand its research and development operations at its Blanchardstown facility by adding up to 50 new high level software and electronic engineering positions over four years.  Option Wireless Limited announced on 4 December that it will, in an addition to its manufacturing and services facility in Cork, add 145 new high quality production jobs over the next three years and undertake leading edge process development activities in that period.  Renishaw in Dublin announced on 30 November that it will establish a new research and development function with 60 new jobs to research and develop expertise in the treatment of neurological disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">On indigenous sectors, the Government is focused on the needs of manufacturing and the services sector.  We have strategies in place to deliver growth, strengthened productivity and improved competitiveness.  The report of the high level manufacturing group launched earlier this year contains some 26 recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity, leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development, which will ensure Irish manufacturers can continue to compete successfully on international markets and provide high value sustainable employment.  These recommendations will be actioned by a new manufacturing forum I will shortly be establishing.  It will bring key representatives from the manufacturing industry together with the relevant Government people and employee representatives and will also act as a strong champion and advocate for the evolving manufacturing sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The services sector and the growing services element within manufacturing companies are vital to the next stage of our economic performance.   We recently carried out an evaluation of the specific needs of the services sector.  The report of the services strategy group, Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland, was published on 12 September 2008 and will guide the development of our services strategy into the future to exploit the opportunities this sector presents.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">As well as growing and diversifying our internationally-traded services, the report also recognises that locally-traded services are a powerful source of wealth creation and employment in their own right, and play a pivotal role in determining the performance of the economy.  It sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential.  The implementation of these recommendations will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as e-learning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.  My Department is working in conjunction with other Departments to progress the implementation of these recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">We are fully committed to strengthening the competitiveness and productive capacity of the economy.  Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, which are technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.  Yesterday I announced a €24 million investment by Diageo over the next three years to expand its research and development activity across an extensive range of innovative project areas.  This project makes the Dublin operation the innovation core of Diageo's research and development activity within the global beer technical centre, and signals the very high value the company places on Ireland for its innovative capability.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The retail sector continues to play a pivotal role in the Irish economy and employs more than 200,000 people.  I recently met a cross-section of retailers and we had a good exchange on the preliminary findings of the Forfás study on the relative cost of doing business North and South.  The preliminary findings of that study show that higher operating costs for labour, property, energy and other utilities in the retail sector here would justify a price differential of approximately 5% with Northern Ireland for grocery items and 7.5% for goods in department stores.  The actual gap, however, is far greater in many cases, even for goods such as foodstuffs where there is no difference in VAT rates between North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">I can understand that there are concerns regarding the recent VAT reduction in Northern Ireland which has resulted in calls for a similar reduction here.  Although the reduction in the UK standard VAT rate will have an impact on the price differential on some goods between the North and the South, the UK has increased excise on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on those items.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">Approximately half the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard rate of VAT and are unaffected by the change in the standard rate.  All Government services, local authorities, hospitals and schools are exempt from VAT.  The majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books and children's clothes and shoes are at the zero rate of VAT.  Housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour-intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair are applicable at the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Where retailers are imposing significant differentials in the price of goods in the South <i>vis-à-vis</i> the price of such goods in their retail outlets in the North, the UK or elsewhere, they have a duty to their customers and to the Irish economy to explain why they are charging such price differentials.  I will continue my engagement with retailers over the coming weeks and my primary objective remains having a strong and vibrant retail sector that secures jobs in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">We are entering a new stage of economic development when we will again become dependent for growth on successfully competing in international markets.  We embark on this juncture with an enterprise base that has been greatly expanded, strengthened and modernised over the last decade.  We are focussed on policies which will provide a competitive operating environment for our key exporting sectors and will place us in the optimal position to benefit from the eventual upturn in the international economy as well as from our longer-term investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">We are working consistently and successfully, despite harsh global economic circumstances, to build Irish exports in world markets.  Our export promotion policies are exerting a direct and positive influence on the ability of Irish exporters to grow their overseas business.  Last week I was in Dubai leading the Enterprise Ireland trade mission where contracts worth €40 million in new export sales were signed by Irish companies.  Enterprise Ireland has also made a number of recent announcements which will create 584 jobs in Norkom Technologies, Glanbia and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, formerly Riverdeep, 880 new jobs in high potential start-ups and €50 million in regional enterprise funding through the institutes of technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The issue of banishing red tape has been raised by all Members of the House.  We have historically been regarded as a lightly regulated, good place to do business, but we can do better and make ease of doing business one of our key competitive advantages.  It is important to encourage dynamism and innovation in the enterprise sector with a responsive regulatory regime that maintains Ireland's reputation for sensible and prudent regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The Government and I are committed to cost efficiencies, responsiveness and the ability to facilitate innovation, competitiveness and growth, embedded in the Irish regulatory approach.  I am committed to reducing the administrative burden on Irish business by 25% by 2012.  It is a demanding target but is a key priority to keep costs for enterprise under control.   The high level group on administrative burdens is focusing on concrete measures in specific policy areas, including taxation, statistics, environment, health and safety, employment and company law.  Its first report sets out a number of instances where procedures have been simplified, making it easier for business to deal with Government.  A consequence of this is a saving of approximately €20 million to Irish businesses in administrative costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Responding to current challenges requires action on many fronts.  The Government is emphasising the correct economic priorities for this time and I highlighted some of my policies designed to support the future growth of high value employment and development of the enterprise sector.  These policies are essential for the future competitiveness of the economy.  Our priority remains the creation of high-quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability that are technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.  The range of investments made recently by companies proves that the strategic choices which we have taken to ensure our long-term competitiveness were the correct choices and are working well in terms of attracting and maintaining investment and growing jobs.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_863">I thank the House for this timely debate, and would like to add to it by commenting on competitiveness and inflation, and discussing developments in public service reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">There is no point in denying that the economy's competitive position has disimproved in recent years and that this deterioration has been driven by a combination of factors.  These include a strong euro, wage increases in excess of productivity, and a relatively high inflation rate.   While here has been much talk of falling prices and negative inflation, the level of prices here stand at more than 20% above the euro area average.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Improving national competitiveness is essential if we are to successfully rebalance the economy towards sustainable, export-led growth and to maintain our attractiveness as a location for inward investment.  The weakness in the international climate means that improving our export performance and repositioning ourselves further up the value chain will be a difficult task, making it all the more necessary to regain lost competitiveness.  While external factors such as exchange rates have an impact on domestic costs, these are beyond our control.  We must seek to control those factors which we can influence, principally wages and prices.  We must also take steps to improve productivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">In support of these objectives, and notwithstanding the need to underpin the sustainability of the public finances, the Government has and will continue to take steps to support competitiveness.  These include maintaining a low burden of taxation on capital and labour.  In the recent budget, the Minister for Finance reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax, to maintaining and enhancing our pro-business tax policies, and to ensuring that Irish workers continue to face a lower tax burden than workers in other EU and OECD countries.  The 12.5% rate of corporation tax has been a key component in our industrial development over the past decade.  Our economic prospects are dependent on a vibrant and modern business base, and our low rate of corporation tax is essential to this.  As a country, we attach a great deal of importance to tax sovereignty and tax competition.  Naturally, it can cut both ways, and where to lay the emphasis in the distribution of taxation is a choice that is made differently between countries.  There is likely to be a revenue flow in both directions at land borders.  The decisions that individuals, families and businesses make in the light of different market signals depends on their judgment of where their best interests lie.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The Finance Bill 2008 includes a number of significant changes to the research and development tax credit scheme.  These include measures to improve the delivery of the benefits of the tax credit, which removes any uncertainty about its availability to businesses.  These changes should encourage further research and development activity here.  The Government is also continuing to prioritise productivity enhancing investment under the national development plan.  The Department of Transport will invest more than €2.8 billion of Exchequer money next year in enhancing our national road network and developing our public transport system. Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending the opening by the Minister for Transport of the Cashel to Cullahill motorway, completing a 60 km stretch between Cullahill and Mitchelstown, which follows the opening of the Cahir to Mitchelstown motorway in July.  Progress continues to be made, even in difficult times.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will spend €2.1 billion of Exchequer money in providing social and affordable housing, improving our water services infrastructure and other projects at local and community level.  The Department of Education and Science will spend its increased capital allocation of €889 million on building schools at both primary and secondary level and on supporting the development of higher education.  Furthermore, these capital projects will continue to support economic activity and will be a welcome benefit to overall investment.  These measures, along with those outlined earlier by the Tánaiste for  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will equip the Irish economy with the skills, infrastructure and operating environment needed, so that we can take full advantage of the global pick-up when it emerges.  They represent the stimulus that we need at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Ireland's national reform programme for 2008 to 2010 brings together a broad range of structural policies and initiatives which aim to support economic growth and employment over the medium term.  The measures put forward in the programme will enhance competition in product markets and flexibility in the labour market, as well as promoting social inclusion.  The highly uncertain domestic and international climate we face underpins the importance of undertaking such reforms.  I am confident that the measures set out in the national reform programme will make a major contribution to the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda in Ireland, and will deliver significant benefits to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">National competitiveness is not solely a matter of Government policy.  It is a shared responsibility of all in society and of social partnership.  The Government, employers and unions must work together to secure long-term gains.  Regaining our competitive position — which as a small open economy is critical to our economic success — will require each of us to play our part and work together to this end.  A key aspect of this is to ensure sensible wage developments over the coming years.  The willingness of the various parties to adopt a realistic approach to wage developments is needed to ensure that we address the changed economic circumstances which we now face.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">A further aspect will be to ensure that where there are improvements in external factors, such as falling oil prices, interest rate cuts and a strong euro, that these are passed on promptly to consumers and business alike.  The National Consumer Agency is currently carrying out a price survey on fuel costs.  The agency will issue a report to the Tánaiste, which will contain the results of an examination of the wholesale costs of fuel and oil and the retail prices charged in the forecourts.  The decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation — following a public consultation process — not to increase the price of electricity or gas next January is also very welcome.  Working together along these lines will help to improve Ireland's competitive position in the years ahead.  The current and prospective easing of inflation will also be of benefit, especially to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Ireland's inflation rate has now been below the euro area average for five consecutive months.  As measured by the CPI, inflation has fallen from an annual average of 5% in June to 4% in October 2008.  The recent falls in the price of oil on global markets are a welcome development from both an inflation and competitiveness perspective.  Oil is currently trading at under $45 per barrel, down from almost $150 during the summer.  While the timing and coverage of surveys differ, it is clear that these lower oil prices are now being reflected in prices at the pump.  The latest CPI data shows that in October alone, a sizeable price decrease of 5.2% was recorded for diesel, 5% for petrol and 11% for home heating oil.  Further declines are expected in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">A further significant easing in the average rate of inflation in 2009 is anticipated, due to a combination of moderating commodity prices, favourable base effects, such as the fallout of the large increases in food and oil prices that occurred in 2008, and an easing in economic activity.  The recent ECB interest rate cuts will underpin an easing in the rate of CPI inflation, and provide timely support to the economy.  Some commentators are now suggesting that CPI inflation could even temporarily turn negative over the course of next year.  Inflation in the year to date has been driven mostly by external factors, namely, the global rise in oil and food prices and increases in mortgage interest rates.  Given this, it is misleading to suggest that Government charges are significantly increasing the rate of inflation.  The Government is committed to achieving a moderate rate of inflation.  In light of this, when developing public policy be it at budget time or during the year due consideration is given to any potential inflationary impacts.  At the current juncture, such impacts must also be balanced against the need to underpin the sustainability of the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">The Government is currently in the process of looking at the public service with a view to reducing our cost base and enabling Government business to be carried out more efficiently.  As part of this process, the Minister for Finance announced the establishment of a special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes in his recent budget.  This group will review the scope for reducing or refocusing the existing range of expenditure programmes.  It will critically consider the number of public servants employed across all areas, in order to assess the scope for transferring staff to priority areas and for reducing total numbers, and to identify surplus staff.  The overall efficiency of the public service will be examined, including ways of doing business that are out of line with the needs of a modern, responsive public service.  The group will also make recommendations for the further rationalisation of State agencies beyond the measures announced in the budget, on which the Government will make the decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Major savings have been achieved on public expenditure during the course of this year and projected savings have been integrated into the Estimates for 2009.  More work is to be done in this regard, as in every area of public service reform.  A new operations unit in the Office of Public Works designed to improve the performance of public procurement will be operational by mid-2009.  Its immediate focus will be to improve value for money in public procurement, to reduce the cost of procurement to the Exchequer, as well as to seek to establish a better procurement capacity.  It will aim to encourage appropriate cross-Border co-operation and in this regard, I thank the Northern Ireland Finance Minister for making one of his experts available to us at my request.  A workshop with experts is scheduled to take place tomorrow.  It is intended that significant benefits will accrue from the enhanced use of best practice procurement techniques, including electronic procurement and the employment of e-auctions where appropriate.  This approach is already in existence to some degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Similar to most of the world's advanced economies, we are facing significant economic and fiscal challenges in the immediate future.  In the case of a small open economy like Ireland, it is all the more important that we improve our competitive position in the difficult period ahead.  If we do so, we will help to lay the foundations for recovery and future economic success.  It will not be easy or pain-free to regain national competitiveness.  We will all need to work together to this end.  The Government has and will continue to take steps to support competitiveness and the wider economy.  We are doing this while underpinning the sustainability of the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">While Fine Gael is demanding more stringent borrowing levels, in general, it is also seeking a reversal of almost all unpopular Government decisions, which would further widen the gap that, in theory, it wishes to see narrowed.  While I do not question the credibility of esteemed individual Deputies on the Fine Gael Front Bench, I see no evidence of an attempt to create a coherent response at local and national level to the country's difficulties.  I have not seen anything that would help voters to predict what Fine Gael would do in government if it had the chance.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">I welcome the opportunity to speak on Deputy Varadkar's important motion, which needs to be discussed in the House.  It is clear from the Government amendment that it has failed to take on board many of the issues outlined in the Deputy's motion.  Having read the amendment, it is clear that the members of the Government are not living in the same world as the rest of the Irish public.  The amendment makes it clear that the Government does not appreciate that retailers and small businesses throughout the country are being squeezed.  The Government's trite response indicates that it is not willing to show any leadership in addressing this issue or helping to ensure that small businesses survive.  I refer in particular to the Tánaiste, who has reminded us that neither she nor any other member of the Cabinet owns a shop.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is welcome to criticise the position of the Fine Gael Front Bench, or the party as a whole, as much as he likes.  However, I remind him that my party colleague, Deputy Bruton, set out a coherent strategy that would have improved the situation and would have prevented the messy cuts that were ultimately necessary.  While I am keen to speak about the Fine Gael motion, rather than being distracted by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, I cannot ignore the demands of the Government's unreal amendment.  In the current economic climate, it is incredible that any government would attempt to commend itself on its "prudent management" of the public finances.  Fianna Fáil has yet to accept any responsibility for its handling of the economy over the last 11 years.  It has been anything but prudent.  It should accept that its management of the economy caused this country to go into recession ahead of most of its European counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The Government amendment welcomes the continued job creation, as if we are all blissfully unaware of the fact that 269,000 people, many of whom will not receive any social welfare payments before Christmas, are on the live register.  When I was in my office, I listened to the Tánaiste talking about job creation in various parts of the country.  Perhaps she should visit Edenderry, Clara or Roscrea to explain to the workers of Rosderra Meats how they will get social welfare payments and tell them whether alternative employment will be available if the Government fails to support companies in the pig sector.  The Tánaiste speaks about supporting Irish business and indigenous enterprise, but she does not act in a way that supports her words.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">I would like to speak briefly about the foolish decision to increase VAT by 0.5%, which was compounded by the UK Government's decision to reduce the VAT rate in that jurisdiction to 15%, thereby putting further pressure on Irish business.  One interesting aspect of the VAT increase is that it led to an increase of 10 cent in the cost of the toll on the M4-M6 motorway from 1 December last.  This shows that Government policy is costing people money.  The signs on the motorway said that the toll was increasing from €2.70 to €2.80 as a result of the budget day VAT increase.  I am not sure whether similar increases have come into effect on other toll roads, as I have not been on them since 1 December.  Unless my maths are wrong, the budget day VAT increase should have led to a 1.35 cent increase in the cost of the toll.  However, the operators of the M4-M6 toll were able to pass on a 10 cent charge to consumers, business people and commuters who use the motorway day in, day out.  Nothing has been done about it.  I imagine that similar increases have been imposed on other toll roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The Government amendment "welcomes the recent decision of the Commission for Energy Regulation not to increase the price of gas or electricity".  When there was a dramatic increase in the cost of oil some time ago, the utility companies successfully used it as an excuse to demand substantial price increases.  Now that the price of oil has decreased dramatically, the Government should be looking for reductions in energy prices, in the interests of consumers and small businesses, rather than congratulating itself on not looking for further increases.  The public does not believe the members of the Government when they pat themselves on the back and say they are doing a great job.  When the Commission for Energy Regulation is deciding whether to increase or decrease the price of gas or electricity, it should listen to the views of small businesses and groups like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that work with people on social welfare.  As things stand, the commission does not listen to anything other than the very biased views of the utility companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The most ludicrous aspect of the amendment — it is almost entertaining — is the section in which the Government commends itself for setting a target.  We know the Government was not inclined to set many targets over the last 11 years, but it is going too far by praising itself "on its target for reducing the burden of regulation on business by 25%".  If that target is achieved, I will come to this House to commend the Government.  That is when a commendation would be appropriate.  The setting of a target should not be praised.  If businesses operated in such a manner, we would be facing even worse circumstances than those we currently face.  If one walks down the main street of any town in this country, one will be confronted with the reality that businesses are struggling to survive.  Some shops have closed and others have "closing down" or "sale" signs as they try desperately to survive.  While sales are welcome, the impact of shop closures is questionable.  When people try to improve or expand their businesses, they are hit with severe development levies.  I fear that parking charges will increase in the coming weeks.  Business people are terrified that local authority rates will also increase.  The only thing keeping many businesses going is the hope that the Christmas market might improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">There is a sad lack of the leadership in this Government, from the top down.  I have already mentioned the Tánaiste.  The only solution that has been proposed by the Minister for Finance to date has been to ask people to shop a little bit more.  Does he not realise that his budget means that most people cannot do so?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_887">I congratulate my party colleague, Deputy Varadkar, on introducing this important motion.  During last year's election campaign, Fine Gael told the people that Fianna Fáil had lost its way by becoming more complacent and less competent throughout its years in office.  It is sad that our analysis has proven to be so accurate so clearly and so quickly.  Fine Gael has consistently pointed out not only that the Government is responsible for this country's sustained loss of national and international competitiveness, but also that it is indifferent to the phenomenon.  We have relentlessly pointed out the economic dangers and personal risks of the domestically generated housing bubble.  Such problems are largely of the Government's own making and have little to do with international factors.  The Government ignored our warnings about these serious problems.  The consequences of the Government's incompetence are visible everywhere, for example, in the latest CSO figures, the Exchequer figures for income and expenditure and the unemployment statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The most spectacular example of Government incompetence can be seen every day of the week when large numbers of cars queue to go across the Border.  I am disappointed that the Tánaiste, who has a key portfolio, is not here to hear me explain that she has misread the situation.  Thousands of people cross the Border each day to do their shopping.  This problem relates not only to domestic shopping, but also to other sectors.  People's construction needs are being met by companies north of the Border.  A serious and genuine crisis is developing for retail and wholesale traders along the southern side of the Border.  The bulk purchasing of domestic goods of every description is a significant problem for retailers in this jurisdiction.  Similarly, the bulk purchasing of wholesale goods and services is becoming a serious problem for wholesaler traders here.  Such purchasing would not exist if a level taxation playing field was in place.  The Tánaiste was quoted last week as telling retailers to drop their prices.  It costs 30% more to create a job in this State than it does in the North.  Retailers and wholesale traders in this jurisdiction are losing business and market share to an extent that threatens their viability.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">I recently received an anguished telephone call from a representative of a leading building supply company in my constituency.  He thought he had negotiated the sale of a new kitchen installation with a builder for approximately €13,000.  However, a few days later he learned that the builder had crossed the Border to purchase the same installation for less than €10,000.  One might ask how this saving was achieved.  I wish to make it clear to the Minister that there is a loophole in this area.  The builder in question crossed the Border, submitted a VAT number and purchased the installation without having to pay VAT.  It is as simple as that.  The transaction also assumes that the builder gave a valid VAT number.  In this case the VAT will come back to him several months later, but for that period the builder will have a better cash flow — a critical advantage when credit cannot be obtained.  Of course it may also happen that the builder gives in an invalid VAT number in which case the VAT bill never comes back to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The Government must take responsibility for this situation.  It is a major anomaly and is crippling businesses.  The Government must take urgent action in order to prevent these companies from failing.  Fianna Fáil in government in this jurisdiction has failed to control local costs and failed to control taxation and VAT levels.  The VAT and duty differentials that apply between the Republic and Northern Ireland are leading to the unprecedented levels of customers from our jurisdiction engaging in cross-Border shopping.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">However, the problem is not confined to currency, duty and taxation levels.  Irish pre-tax prices are also dearer than those, north of the Border.  Retailers and wholesalers in this jurisdiction simply cannot afford to be put at such a competitive disadvantage in these very difficult times.  The failure of Government to deal immediately with this crisis will result in even more Irish business failures, in job losses and in losses in Exchequer income.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">This is a very important issue and I am very disappointed the Tánaiste, who is based in Donegal, is doing nothing for small businesses.  Every business in the six Border counties is on its knees.  All the Tánaiste can suggest is for retailers to drop their prices when the costs of creating a job here are 30% higher.  Rates and all other Government charges are considerably higher than those in Northern Ireland.  If the Tánaiste wants to get competitive she should reduce the Government costs, including VAT, and then we can have some hope of doing business.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_893">I broadly support this motion and I call on the Government to recognise that the increases in heating and fuel costs, and daily living expenses have had a severe effect on working families on low and middle incomes, which has ultimately damaged our economy and made the path to economic recovery all the more difficult to find.  While the Government will go on about low inflation or even the projected deflation for the next 12 months, in key areas such as home heating and everyday shopping, the Government has stood back while prices spiralled out of control.  Energy and food costs have more than doubled over the past 12 months, while a litany of charges and levies were sneaked in through budget 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">As the result of the Government placing the burden of our economic difficulties on the shoulders of ordinary people, families have been prevented from using their own incomes to boost the Irish economy and are effectively being forced to shop outside of the State.  The failure of the Government to intervene at an earlier stage to halt inflation has a direct negative impact on areas such as the retail sector.  However, while prices are at the highest ever level and consumer confidence is at an all-time low, options remain available.  I urge the Government for once to start listening to people on this side of the House and to change the direction it has taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">We have all seen the recent figures released by the European Commission, demonstrating that pre-tax petroleum prices in Ireland are 24% higher than the EU average.  The only explanation for the disparity in prices is greed on the part of certain motor fuel outlets and a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach by a Fianna Fáil-led Government that chose to ignore that people are being ripped off.  However, the issue of high energy costs goes beyond petroleum.  Over the past eight years Ireland has moved from being below the EU average for electricity costs in 2001 to becoming one of the most expensive EU countries for electricity.  Ireland rates as the second highest of the EU 25 for industrial electricity prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">While the Government will no doubt point to the recent freeze in electricity and gas prices, only last August the ESB was granted a 17.5% increase in tariffs, while Bord Gáis was given permission for a 20% hike.  Both State bodies had to withdraw their most recent applications for tariff increases as world energy prices have fallen by up to 60%.  While global energy prices may have tumbled, we have seen only a minuscule decrease of less than 1% in ESB-supplied electricity and nothing has been forthcoming from Bord Gáis.  Despite claims to the contrary, the decreases in international energy prices are not being passed on and it remains to be seen if the ESB and Bord Gáis end up passing on the decrease or keep the difference themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">High electricity and home-heating costs impact most on low-income families which spend a far greater proportion of their household budgets on these basic items.  As people are spending more on their petrol, home heating and electricity, they now have less money to spend on other basic items such as food and clothing, which has the inevitable consequence of damaging other sectors of the economy, such as retail.  There is undoubtedly a problem with statutory bodies, such as the Commission for Energy Regulation, sanctioning increases without proper regard to the consequences for families and business.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">While I support the proposal that would require regulatory organisations to hold public meetings, more measures are necessary to ensure that the regulatory bodies take account of the effects of their decisions.  This is clearly not happening today.  Another measure could be to oblige regulatory authorities to conduct proper impact assessments as to what are the likely effects on low and middle-income families, and on businesses if they sanction increases.  For there to be any transparency, impact assessments should also be published by the regulatory bodies.  This should have been happening as a matter of course anyhow.  It never happened because the Government was sleepwalking through that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">Retail price disparities are damaging shops and stores south of the Border.  The National Consumer Agency has found a margin of difference up to 30% in food prices on either side of the Border, which must be inexplicable.  I have had representations from businesses in my constituency which are being damaged by the numbers of shoppers who are travelling north.  However, rather than coming to the aid of retailers, the Government has made matters worse by increasing VAT to 21.5%, resulting in a 6.5% difference between North and South, which has placed retailers at a competitive disadvantage, with which they may not be able to cope.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The decision is all the more bizarre in light of the shortfall in VAT revenue.  VAT receipts are down by €2.1 billion and with this increase not only is the Government sending shoppers to the North, but for those who will continue to shop in the South the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government is removing up to €200 from their annual incomes.  My party has always highlighted the damage that is being done to the long-term development of both economies, North and South, through disparities in taxation.  While the retailers in the North are now benefiting at the expense of retailers in South, the situation could change in the future and Northern shop owners could end up suffering the same hardship.  There is a history of such seesawing of benefit on either side of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Ultimately, the Government will need to go beyond the lip service it has been paying to the development of an all-island economy and start taking on board our proposals and the proposals of a number of organisations, business groups and bodies such as InterTradeIreland.  One of our proposals is for VAT harmonisation.  While we accept that many more measures must be taken to ensure a proper level playing field, a 2% reduction in VAT would make a significant difference at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">On the issue of levies and charges through State agencies and Departments, the increases made by the Government are hitting vulnerable people the most.  By increasing accident and emergency unit and hospital charges, the Government is effectively discouraging people who may be in need of urgent care, from going to hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">By increasing school transport charges the Government is making it more difficult for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to continue their education.  However, these increases are not being done to improve or safeguard our services.  They are being initiated while the health and education services are being cut back.  The cutbacks in health and education will do long-lasting damage to our public services and I urge the Government to bow to public pressure on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">The 1% income levy on workers who earn more than €18,305 is unwarranted and will damage low income families.  The levy should apply only on incomes in excess of €38,000 and we believe that the threshold for the 3% levy should be reduced to incomes in excess of €200,000.  Our proposal to remove the PRSI ceiling would have had the double effect of raising much needed tax revenue, while cushioning those on low and middle incomes from the worst effects of the increase.  All of these charges and levies amount to more than €1,000 being taken out of the pockets of families on moderate incomes at a time when they need it the most.  We are all aware of the shortfall in public finances and the economic downturn, but the measures implemented by the Government can only serve to perpetuate this recession and exacerbate the dire state of our public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">I will give the House a brief outline of what it is to try to shop in the North.  Accounts have been to relayed to me about my nearest town, Newry.  The PSNI had to be called twice last week to separate people from the South fighting.  In one case two women were fighting over a shopping trolley which somebody had just finished with after loading the groceries into the boot of his or her car.  In another instance, two men were fighting over a parking space.  Somebody had just left a parking space in a well-known shopping centre in Newry and two men were literally at fisticuffs to get the space.  Others, while using their shopping trolleys in the aisles, are having goods removed from them by other shoppers who cannot find the items.  It is no pleasure to shop in some of the busier shopping centres close to the Border and in the North.  While I can understand why people from the South would contemplate moving North given the huge price disparity, it is no pleasure.  There is much more comfort to be had in this State.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
          <p eId="para_906">I have had a number of opportunities to address this House and the Seanad on fisheries matters of late in a challenging time for our fishermen.  I have welcomed each of these opportunities as it is my firm belief that it is our collective duty to engage in informed debate to enlighten the policy formulation process for the betterment of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">The subject of this debate is the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council which will, as usual, be dominated by discussions on the Commission's proposals for setting of total allowable catches, TACs, and quotas for 2009.  There is enormous complexity attached to these proposals and the time afforded me does not allow me to examine the issues in full detail.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, has been already actively engaged on many fronts since the publication of the Commission's proposals on 7 November, including active discussions with industry and a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Joe Borg in Brussels last Thursday, 5 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">The Minister, Deputy Smith, has also had discussions with Mr. Huw Irranca-Davies MP, UK Minister for the Natural and Marine Environment, Wildlife and Rural Affairs, on areas of common interest and with a view to work closely with him at this Council.  In general, however, the proposals do not paint a pretty picture and give bad news across many stocks, suggesting cuts to many of the stocks of economic importance to the Irish fleet and additional conservation measures that will impact significantly on the activities of the fleet.  I share the concerns of the industry as to the clarity, rationale and appropriateness of some of the proposed measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">I want, however, to dispel any misunderstanding in this matter.  The proposals are, to a large extent, based on scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, and I will return to this topic in detail later.  The indications are that many of the stocks targeted by our fishing fleet are in a poor state from a sustainability point of view.  It is important to understand that the Commission's overall goal in proposing these measures is to deliver a viable and sustainable European fishing industry into the future.  The cuts do not target Irish fishermen specifically.  Quotas for individual member states which have an interest in a given stock are reduced proportionately, in other words, the concept of relative stability, where each member state continues to get its fixed percentage of the available catch, is maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">There has also been some positive news, namely, with regard to mackerel, where agreement was reached at the coastal states meeting in London on 30 and 31 October, with the overall TAC going up by 33% from 456,000 tonnes in 2008 to 605,000 tonnes in 2009.  This will result in the net Irish quota, after deductions for the payback for undeclared Scottish landings, going from approximately 45,000 tonnes to 62,000 tonnes.  One caveat on this stock is regarding the discussions on the EU-Norway agreement, the third round of which is in progress in Oslo this week.  There have been suggestions that mackerel could be used to balance the fishing opportunity exchange this year.  We are defending our strongly held belief that mackerel cannot form part of the transfer as we do not gain from the exchange of opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I do not want to underestimate the challenge facing us in successfully defending our stance on the matter, but assuming we are successful, the increase in the mackerel TAC will be maintained and available to our fishermen.  This is greatly significant for Ireland and is the reward for Irish fishermen adopting tough, responsible fishing practices for this stock.  In value terms using an estimated price per tonne of €1,200, this results in an increase of over €20 million to the pelagic fishing sector in 2009, from €54 million to €74.4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Killeen, at the November Agriculture and Fisheries Council in successfully negotiating for the exclusion of the Celtic Sea from the new cod recovery plan, which will also be given effect in the TAC and quota regulation.  This was of major importance for the Irish mixed whitefish fleet as the restrictions suggested would have been disproportionate.  It was also a recognition of Ireland's position that a one-size-fits-all approach to stock recovery was not appropriate for the Celtic Sea.  We are committed to working to strengthen the state of this stock, which is of importance to the Irish fleet.  We are supportive of the appropriate conservation measures for Celtic Sea cod, such as spawning area closures which were originally proposed by fishermen, and are delivering positive effects on stock levels in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">I said earlier that I would return to the question of the science and the scientific advice.  As legislators and administrators we have to be informed by the expert advice, though not necessarily accept blindly the advice given.  Many questions asked about the veracity of specific scientific data or lack of it at any given time.  We must always be conscious of the fact that the fisheries resource is the bedrock of the seafood industry and scientific advice on the state of the fisheries resource will dictate the level of fishing opportunities that will be available.  Our objective must be to halt the decline in many fish stocks so as to protect the future of our fishermen and coastal communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">I will give a brief flavour of the state of some of the key stocks from an Irish perspective.  Scientists are concerned about the overall state of the fisheries resource.  There are serious concerns about the state of the cod, whiting and haddock stocks off the west coast of Scotland.  The Commission proposes a closure of these fisheries for 2009.  Irish Sea cod has collapsed and shows no sign of recovery.  However, the haddock stock in the Irish Sea is increasing.  The Celtic Sea cod stock remains below the desired biomass level and there is major concern about data quality available for scientific analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The stocks of hake, monk and megrim are important to vessels operating from the south west and west coasts of Ireland and scientists consider these stocks to be in a stable state.  However, because of the poor data available for analysis, the Commission considers it important to limit expansion of these fisheries and so the proposed 2009 TACs will be reduced by 15%.  There are many plaice and sole stocks in the waters around Ireland but for many of these stocks there is limited scientific data and the state of the stocks is unknown.  There are serious concerns about the Irish Sea sole stock and the introduction of recovery measures is recommended.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">Nephrops stocks, which we know as prawns in the fishing harbours of my area, Fingal, are of vital importance to the Irish fleet with very important grounds in the north Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, Aran grounds and the Porcupine Bank.  These fisheries support many coastal communities.  Scientists consider the stocks generally to be in a stable state but there is concern about the stock in the Porcupine Bank.  The stocks of mackerel and horse mackerel are healthy, while there are serious concerns about the herring stocks in the Celtic Sea and off the Donegal coast.  The blue whiting stock is decreasing and the 2009 TAC will be severely cut.  Sharks and rays are important species in the ocean ecosystem and are vulnerable to overfishing.  There are serious concerns about the decline of the spurdog population.  The introduction of a new total allowable catch for rays is not the preferred option from a scientific perspective for sustainable fishing of this stock.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">As I have said, the proposed regulation is complex and detailed, and I hope I have given a flavour of that.  I cannot address every issue here; however, I do wish to elaborate on some of the key issues we face in the ongoing discussions leading into what will be tense and protracted negotiations at Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">The system of the Hague preferences stems from a European Council decision in 1976 that recognised the development needs of peripheral coastal regions whose populations were heavily dependent on fishing activity.  The system simply grants us an improved share of our traditional stocks when they fall below a certain level.  The system also benefits the UK.  Each year at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council the concept of the Hague preferences may come under attack from a number of other member states, and this year will be no exception.  The application of the Hague preferences is of paramount political importance to Ireland.  Our strong view is that the system reflects a formal political agreement of all member states which forms a foundation stone of the Common Fisheries Policy and a critical element of the system of relative stability.  We do not believe it is in any way appropriate to challenge this integral element of the CFP at each December Council.  The proper place for any debate on the Hague preferences is in the context of the overall CFP review debate, which is scheduled for 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The Minister, Deputy Smith, met with Commissioner Borg in Brussels last Friday to discuss issues of major importance to Ireland in advance of the Council.  The Hague preference system was top of the agenda, and the Minister informed the Commissioner in a very forthright manner that we would be expecting him to maintain the consistent position of the Commission on the matter and defend this fundamental element of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>

        <speech by="#TomSheahan" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
          <p eId="para_920">I was not long in the House when I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at which the former Minister, Deputy Coughlan, was in attendance.  Perhaps naively, I asked her whether she had ever gone to Europe and asked for an increase in fishing quota.  I got a very disingenuous answer and wondered whether I should not have asked the question.  The answer I got was "No".  The Minister of State referred to the Hague preferences and so on.  When one considers the full picture with regard to fisheries in this country, one realises that since we joined the EEC €400 billion worth of fish has been taken out of Irish waters.  It is no wonder the majority of coastal communities voted "No" to the Lisbon treaty.  It is well known that fishing communities all over the country strongly rejected the treaty.  Nothing is being done now that will encourage people to support Lisbon II.  In fact, it is the opposite.  This is something the Minister needs to bear in mind when he goes to the December meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">A big issue at present is the closure of area 6A under the guise of cod recovery.  The Minister of State mentioned in his statement that cod in the Celtic Sea is in a relatively healthy state and he even mentioned that it was the fishermen themselves that introduced seasonal closures of Celtic Sea cod fishing during spawning season.  Why was such a system never introduced to area 6A by the EU?  The fishermen are the best conservationists out there because they are not in it for a fast buck.  We are talking about generations of families that have been involved in fishing.  They did this in the Celtic Sea, and I must ask why such a system was not introduced in area 6A rather than a blanket ban.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">The proposed ban on fishing in area 6A is a serious issue for fishermen in the north west and also as a precedent for other areas.  The European Commission is claiming that this approach is required as a response to the state of cod stocks.  It is part of the proposal on total allowable catches and quotas which is to be decided in Brussels in December.  The Commission has proposed what would effectively be a complete closure of whitefish fisheries in area 6A inside 100 fathoms for 2009.  Under this proposal, only prawn fisheries, with very low by-catches, will be allowed in the area inside 100 fathoms.  It is clear there is a serious threat for all, particularly for vessels that have limited potential to move to other areas, that is, to the Celtic Sea.  Given other changes in control in the Irish Sea and area 6, this adds to the complications that will be caused by the measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Needless to say, we wish to make clear our hostile reaction to this proposal.  An extraordinary aspect of the proposal is that it has only been tabled in recent weeks with the quota proposals.  It did not go through the consultative stages that all proposals normally go through with the Minister, the Department, advisory committees or regional advisory councils.  The European Commission did not even do the Irish Government the courtesy of informing it or consulting with it before publishing the proposals.  One must question the Minister's clout at the Commission when it publishes these proposals without even consulting him or any of the other authorities involved in the fishing industry.  It gives us little confidence for December to know that the Minister and the Department were not even contacted about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The Commission's proposals for total allowable catches and quotas for 2009 involve major cuts in fishing quotas.  In fact, the quotas of 22 out of the 25 species listed recently at a committee meeting have been reduced by between 15% and 35%.  This represents multi-million euro losses for the industry at time when it is trying to recover from its recent difficulties.  It is on its knees due to what it went through during the year with high fuel costs and so on.  Apart from the obvious negative effects of lower quotas, there are a number of other issues.  The reductions in quotas completely undermine the basis for the decommissioning programme, on which €38 million has been committed in 2008.  The programme's aim is to allow vessels which remain in the fleet to have more quota to share, thus increasing their viability in the future.  If these proposals go ahead we will have to have another decommissioning scheme.  We had decommissioning in the whitefish fleet to bring down the number of boats so there would be a bigger catch for a smaller number of boats.  Now the quota is to be decreased.  There will need to be another decommissioning if this is to go ahead in its present form.  Quota cuts will also have a counterproductive effect by encouraging discards.  The word "discard" is a dirty word.  Perfectly healthy produce is being cast overboard and this is immoral.  Discards have been highlighted as a major problem for a long time.  If these proposals go ahead in their current format, it will only force people to discard more fish.  The quota cut for prawns is totally unjustified because the scientific advice called for catches to be kept at 2007 levels which penalises Ireland simply for catching near enough to its full quota.  This should be high on the Minister's list of priorities come December.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">Another feature of the quota cuts is the fraudulent approach based on average catches in recent years rather than average quotas.  We simply cannot have more quota cuts.  We must adopt a new approach based on sound science, as the Minister of State said.  At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the science available from the Marine Institute was questioned.  This science should take account of the regional, social and economic aspects in a partnership approach.  The present approach is not helping.  It does not help stocks or fishermen and it discredits the whole system.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The Hague Preferences to which the Minister of State referred, were negotiated by Dr. Garret FitzGerald in 1976.  We have benefited from additional quota based on a complex formula.  The Hague Preferences are an integral part of the share out of quota although technically they have to be approved each year.  The Minister of State said that other EU countries attack the Hague Preferences every year and these must be copper-fastened.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">We are dealing with statements on the Agriculture and Fisheries Council but I have to ask what is the state of the Cawley report.  What is the Government strategy?  A massive investment package was announced.  Only part of the decommissioning identified as being required has been delivered.  When will the money left over from decommissioning be spent?  Will the rest of the Cawley report be implemented?</p>

          <p eId="para_930">Something that does not necessarily relate to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, given that we do not have many opportunities to discuss fisheries is the additional funding emergency measures were agreed in July.  It is still urgent that progress be made to make funds available at the earliest possible date.  I understand that the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, has made submissions and there is an ongoing campaign.  We all know that fuel prices have decreased dramatically but the cost inputs for fishermen during that period were significant as were losses incurred during that period.  We should support that measure. Will that €37 million expenditure be expedited?  Perhaps the officials could revert to us in due course on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">With the pending December Council of Ministers meeting due on 18 and 19 December, it is important that this House give time to debating the issues at hand.  I have had some significant briefings today from the FIF, more specifically from the Irish South and West Fish Producers' Organisation, on the issues.  It is worth reiterating some of the points they make.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">They state that the decisions taken at the December Council meeting will be vital to the future of the industry.  I note the Minister of State said he supports the appropriate conservation measures for Celtic Sea cod such as spawning area closures which were originally proposed by fishermen and are delivering positive effects on stock levels in that area.  The organisation's position is such that it proposes that the creation of a sub-divided management area separating the English Channel from the rest of the existing Celtic Sea, has certain implications for Ireland.  The organisation's briefing paper states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_933">The separation of Area VIId, the English Channel, from the remainder of Area VIIb-k for the purposes of management, and the establishment of a separate Total Allowable Catch for that area has significant implications for the Irish fishing industry.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_934">While the measure is not objectionable in itself, the subdivision of the stock must not disadvantage Irish fishermen by directly dividing the quotas, giving Ireland quota in an area (VIId) where Irish fishermen do not fish.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_935">Irish fishermen catch most of the Cod in the west of the existing management area, to the south of Ireland.  This must be reflected in the new subdivision of quota between the management areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">I could not have put the argument any better.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">With regard to the proposals on the fishing effort, there is a school of thought that suggests that the European Commission is effectively re-writing, after the fact, the decision reached by the Council.  The FIF state that the Commission is re-writing the text of the decision on fishing effort in the Irish Sea and the north west which was reached at last month's EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council.  This cannot be allowed as it would mean an immediate 25% cut in fishing possibilities in 2009, from what was in the decision which was in itself misguided, draconian and punitive.  The November Council of Fisheries Ministers reached a decision on a new and intensified series of measures for fisheries in the Irish Sea and the north west.  I also understand that the Irish Government and industry succeeded in thwarting the efforts to have this approach extended to the south and west coasts.  The FIF has stated this to me today.  The measure agreed which affect the Irish Sea and north west, clearly curtailed fishing effort in the form of kilowatt-days to the amount of effort in previous base years.  It has only come to light in recent days that the Commission is going significantly beyond what was agreed and it now proposes in 2009 to impose a further 25% cut from the base effort.  This is contrary to all understanding of what was agreed.  I understand the Minister may share this position but he needs to put it on the record of the House at some stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">I note the Minister of State's statement on the Hague Preferences, that they are an integral part of the TAC, total allowable catch and quota allocations system and they must continue to be allocated or formally incorporated into the TAC and quota system and not perhaps subjected to the annual approval which they must undergo.  I understand the point made by the Minister of State when he states that certain member states would seek to denigrate or downgrade that agreement.  The position adopted by the FIF in continuing to ensure that the Hague issues are maintained, is paramount to the industry in the future.  More recently there has been positive interplay between the fishermen's organisations and the Minister.  The emergency package agreed in July, however, needs to be expedited.  It is a matter of grave importance to the industry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_939">Coming from a midlands county where the lakes and canals are important to its fishing industry, I have listened with great care to what Deputies Sheahan, Ferris and Sherlock have said about coastal fishing.  In July I took an interest in developments in the fishing industry.  I know the significance and the potential of the forthcoming Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting will have on fishermen's incomes.  It is important we ensure the quota restrictions and the emergency measures introduced in July are fully discussed and the Cawley report recommendations, particularly in the structural measures and decommissioning, are accelerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">In July, when the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Tony Killeen, met with fishermen's representatives in Athlone, one major issue was the decommissioning of fleet vessels over 18 m.  The question also arose as to what would happen to those vessels under 18 m.  Will the Minister of State inform the House what developments have been made in this area?</p>
          <p eId="para_941">Fishing is a tough livelihood to which many of us have never been exposed.  Fishermen work hard and it is important they be given every assistance possible.  Although I live in an inland county, I admire the bravery of fishermen who go out at all hours, day and night, to secure a limited but declining livelihood.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">While I hope it is only a rumour, it has been indicated to me by some inland fishermen that there will be a stock delimitation in eel fisheries.  The coastal and sea fishermen have suffered from quota restrictions and so forth.  They have taken more than their share in hardship in this regard.  In the case of eel fisheries, however, there are up to 1,000 jobs at stake.  We can ill afford to lose any more jobs in the fishing industry at whatever level at sea or inland.  Any restrictions on eel fisheries will affect a significant body of fishermen from the midlands to the south west.  It has been indicated to me that there might be a 95-year restriction on eel fishing which I believe is an incorrect interpretation.  Will the Minister comment on this?</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_943">It is vital the Government takes a strong stand in opposition to the latest proposals from the Commission regarding quota allocation and further restrictions on Irish fishermen in Irish waters when the Council of Fisheries Ministers meets next week.  In particular, it must expose the fact that the Commission has gone well beyond what was discussed at the last meeting of the Council in November.  If put into effect, the implications of the Commission's decisions would mean the overall quota available to Irish fishermen will be 25% lower in 2009 than it was this year.  It would also mean the opposition at the November meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council to the extension of measures for the Irish Sea, the north-west, south and the south-west fisheries at the November meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers has been ignored and overturned.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">The Commission has also moved the goalposts with the agreed measures to be applied to the Irish Sea and to the north-west fishery.  It now proposes a further 25% cut, from the base effort, in 2009.  It is incumbent on the Minister to state his view on the Commission's proposals and that he will vigorously oppose them at the Council meeting next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">The manner in which the Commission has acted on this issue illustrates once again the bureaucratic and unaccountable nature in which fishing policy is created in Brussels.  It further underlines the need for this country to make a strong argument in favour of completely overhauling the Common Fisheries Policy, in particular the manner in which it is applied to Irish fishermen and to Irish waters.  It is perpetuating a grossly unfair and inequitable system of quota allocation that goes back to the disastrous deal made on the fisheries sector in the negotiations leading to EEC accession in 1973.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">However, that is a broader argument and the priority now is to address the immediate threat as posed by the Commission's proposals.  The Minister needs to ensure the so-called "Hague preferences" which represent a concession on the original 1973 bad deal on the allocation of quotas in our waters, are placed on a statutory basis.  That is the minimum required to ensure the Hague preferences are not, as is the case at present, subject to annual attack.  An attack which if successful would mean a cut in the cod quota for Irish fishermen of up to 60%.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">It is likely other member states will mount an offensive against the Hague preferences next week at the Council meeting.  The Minister must commit himself to resisting that attack and to securing the preferences on a long-term basis.  That is the minimum that needs to be done, pending a more radical review and reform in the interests of fairness in the entire fisheries policy.  It is worth restating such reform is urgently required.  Otherwise, we will continue to find the Irish fishing sector being subject to constant undermining and attack, with, in many people's opinion, the ultimate reduction of the sector to insignificance.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The Minister must also reject the proposed closure of the whitefish fishery in area 6a.  This would mean the closure of the entire north-west fishery.  Again, the Commission has acted arbitrarily without the proposal being discussed properly at EU level at the advisory committees on fisheries or the north-west waters regional advisory council.  The sector believes the implications of the closure proposal were not subject to a proper economic assessment.  The closure of the north west fishery would have a devastating impact on the fishermen engaged in demersal fishing in that area.  The proposal must be rejected.  If it were allowed to go ahead, the knock-on effect would add to the pressures on other coastal fisheries, including the south west.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Fishermen also argue that the proposed 15% cut in the nephrops quota in area 7 contradicts scientific evidence which has found the stock to be stable.  They also claim it penalises Ireland for having utilised its quota.  Other issues have emerged with, for example, the measures on ray and skate in areas 6 and 7 and in the spurdog fishery.  One problem is with bycatch where a maximum 5% limit has been imposed on spotted dogfish.  This raises the issue of discard catch due to vessels not wishing to contravene regulations but which, by extension, also leads to a massive amount of waste as bycatch is dumped at sea.  A week last Friday, a trawler fishing off the Kerry coast  was forced to dump 2.8 tonnes of spurdog overboard.  The regulations in question often bear little relationship to the reality of the fishery in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">Irish fishermen are also opposed to the proposed large scale transfer of the blue whiting quota to the Norwegian fleet, a transfer that could involve as much as 100,000 tonnes, almost 20% of the overall quota for blue whiting in EU waters.  There is also the issue of proposed quotas for many species in 2009 being based on the average catch in recent years.  Fishermen claim this is penalising them for years in which they have not filled their allocation.  They also claim it will reduce the fishing opportunities available to vessels which remain in operation after decommissioning and that reducing the amount which they can catch will lead to the discarding of marketable fish.  Due to the impact this calculation of quota based on averages will have for the Irish fishery it must be strongly opposed.  The flawed nature of the emergency package agreed during the summer in response to the crisis brought about by increased fuel prices continues to be exposed.  Sufficient funding is not available to address the serious issues and needs that exist and little or nothing has been done to alleviate the difficulties in which a large number of Irish fishermen continue to find themselves at the end of a difficult year.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">Next week's Council meeting is therefore of crucial importance.  If the Commission's proposals are accepted they will have massively negative consequences for the Irish fishery in 2009.  Coming after an already bad year, it would be enough to further accelerate the numbers leaving fishing.  Indeed there are many who believe this is, ultimately, the objective of the Commission and of EU fishing policy as it relates to the Irish industry.  The Minister of State must take a strong stand as he is being urged to unanimously across the Irish fishing sector.  In opposing the Commission proposals I am certain that he will also have the support of others in the House and I urge him to do so.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_349">
          <from>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_952">I am pleased to express some views on the forthcoming Agriculture and Fisheries Council of 18 and 19 December.  This is a new development and a welcome one.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, on his exceptional efforts since his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries and forestry in representing Ireland at European level.  He has left his mark and I know that after the Council meeting he will have left an indelible mark in Europe, taking into account his brief period as Minister of State.  I congratulate him on his success in securing a justified increase in the mackerel quota, going from 49,000 tonnes to 66,000.  This is worth €20 million to the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Given the good shape of the stock, which is in its best shape since the egg survey of the 80s, we will be able to maintain this level and hopefully increase it.  I have noted with enthusiasm in 2007 and 2008 that the mackerel has moved south much earlier than heretofore.  This means that more Irish fishing vessels are fishing nearer to the port of Killybegs and will land at Killybegs.  Even Scottish vessels will land at Killybegs during January.  These will be additional resources for pelagic processing plants there.  We would like all vessels to do that but they cannot be mandated to do so.  Various Ministers have considered this.  It is hard to expect large pelagic vessels fishing off the coast of Norway, if they are inside the four degrees, or off the north coast of Scotland to travel down because of the exorbitant cost due to the increase in the price of oil in the past.  This has changed.  I remember when most fish were landed at Killybegs and we will witness that again this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">I refer to the proposed closure of the whitefish fishery off Donegal, area 6A.  This is not justified and the Minister of State will prove this to the Commission and his colleagues at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council next week.  We have the highest rate of unemployment in the Donegal region and the closure would exacerbate this.  That is not a scientific argument but it is an economic one.  This would be a disaster for Donegal and the Minister of State will resist this measure with great vigour at the Council.  It is not sufficient to resist it, he must offer alternatives.  The alternative is to recommend technical conservation measures such as an increase in the size of mesh.  Ireland has always been to the fore in recommending technical conservation and real time closures.  That would be more effective and I suggest the Minister of State should approach the proposed closure in this vein.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">We are in the 11th hour in respect of blue whiting and transfers to Norway but the Minister of State will take a strong line on this.  He has done so heretofore.  He will try to ensure the EU and Ireland will have a viable blue whiting fishery.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I remember when all blue whiting was for industrial purposes.  The ingenuity of the Irish processing industry developed a valuable blue whiting fishery for human consumption.  We must ensure that the outcome is that there is sufficient blue whiting in the EU and sufficient blue whiting so that Ireland has that valuable fishery.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">I wish the Minister of State well.  He has a good track record in his short time in the industry.  He will do his utmost in these difficult times to ensure Ireland secures a fair and realistic deal when decisions are taken at the end of next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_958">Ar dtús báire ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na comhaltaí go léir a labhair ar an díospóireacht thábhachtach seo faoi chúrsaí iascaireachta.  D'éist mé go géar agus go cúramach leo agus beidh mé ag caint leis an Aire Stáit, Deputy Tony Killeen, i dtaobh na tuairimí agus na moltaí a d'ardaigh Teachtaí le linn na díospóireachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I want to assure the House that we will not shirk our responsibility when it comes to opposing proposals that are unfair, not supported by science, inappropriate or simply impracticable and unable to deliver on the required outcome.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, cannot and will not defend the indefensible and, where it is indisputable from a scientific perspective that particular stocks are being fished unsustainably, he will support the appropriate measures to rectify that situation.  The issues for decision at Council are causing concern around the coast and Members are hearing this at first hand from their constituents, as I am from mine.  It is clear there are issues that will affect the north-west area significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">Deputy Sheahan referred to the Cawley strategy, which remains the widely agreed Government development strategy for the seafood sector.  The Government committed total funding of €118 million for the support and development of the seafood sector in 2009.  The Cawley strategy covers the period from 2007-13.  Dr. Noel Cawley continues to chair a broadly based implementation group, which met two weeks ago, to drive on the implementation of the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">I agree with Deputy Sheahan's comments on discards and the importance of reducing the level of same.  Discarding fish is not acceptable.  We have raised this issue as a priority and we are committed to supporting measures at EU level and bringing forward our ideas to the EU so that urgent action can be taken to reduce and eliminate discards.  Deputy Sherlock referred to the fuel package in July.  In September, Ireland submitted proposals for additional EU funds to support a package of measures to adapt the fleet and increase profitability.  This package involves further decommissioning of fishing vessels.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food raised this matter at the most recent bilateral meeting with Commissioner Borg last week and pressed for the Commission to bring forward proposals for the allocation of additional funds to Ireland at an early date.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Deputy Penrose referred to eel fishing.  There is serious concern about the state of eel stocks at EU level.  The eel fishery is not subject to consideration at the December Fisheries Council.  However, the management and conservation of eels is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and I will convey to him the Deputy's concerns regarding the eel fishery.</p>

          <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_964">Deputy Ferris raised the issue of cod recovery measures agreed at the November Fisheries Council.  Under the cod recovery plan agreed at the Council, a limit on time at sea will apply to vessels targeting whitefish.  The time at sea, established through Ireland's fishing vessels track record in the area, will, for the first time, be administered by each member state.  Our officials have been asked to work closely with the industry in order that these arrangements are best suited to the needs of the fishermen operating in the area.  In addition to this restriction, the Commission is proposing a ban on the use of most whitefish gear in the area.  This is completely unacceptable to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and our officials have worked with industry to come forward with alternative measures that both help to protect the stocks under pressure while allowing fishermen viable fishing in the area.  This issue has been identified as a priority and we will be making the strongest case possible for the alternative proposals we have submitted along with the UK authorities.  With the poor scientific advice on the cod, haddock and whiting stocks in this area, we must accept further restrictions will be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">However, in the Irish Sea, we also face a number of challenges.  Like the cod in the north west, the November Council agreed restrictions on time at sea in the area to help conserve cod.  There is an important prawn fishery in the Irish Sea and the Commission's proposal involves a cut in that total allowable catch, TAC.  We will seek a roll-over of the 2008 TAC, which we consider is justifiable from a scientific perspective, and we will also work to ensure the Commission's proposal for a new regime for the conservation of rays does not stop our fishery in the Irish Sea.  All the scientific advice available to us is supportive of a managed targeted fishery for rays in the Irish Sea and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will make a strong case for such a regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">A number of proposals will impact on the Celtic Sea fisheries.  Cuts in the TACs are proposed for a number of stocks such as monk, megrim, whiting and cod.  These are all important fisheries for our whitefish fleet and, where the scientific advice allows, I will seek adjustments in the Commission's proposals. In this regard, we will work closely with industry to identify the key stocks of most economic importance and give the highest priority to them.  I take on board the economic impact referred to by Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, particularly in Donegal, which must be part of the debate on the best way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">We face tough negotiations at this Council with many cuts in quotas and new difficult conservation measures.  We have a great deal of work ahead of us but we have consulted widely with industry and others and we are clear as to our objectives.  We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to deliver the best package for Ireland.  That will not, unfortunately, include the decommissioning package sought by Deputy Sheehan.  However, I have taken his comments on board and I will give them serious consideration to see what can be done.  As an Irish Sea Minister, I am aware we face serious issues regarding the size and the number of boats fishing limited stocks, which makes it difficult to maintain our conservation objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is determined to act in the best interests of Ireland and the broader Irish fishing community.  We have had some successes regarding the mackerel quota for 2009 and the decision at the November Council not to include the Celtic Sea in the cod recovery plan and I will pass on the encouraging words of Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  Every Member will wish the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and his Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, well in their endeavours on behalf of our fishing sector and the Council negotiations will deliver a fair and balanced package of measures, which will both protect fish stocks going forward while supporting the domestic fishing industry and the coastal communities dependent on fishing.</p>

            <p eId="para_969">The live register numbers for Waterford city and Dungarvan combined stood at 9,786 on 30 November.  This compares to 6,324 on 30 November 2007, representing an increase of 54.7%.  In only one year, unemployment shot up by 54.6% in Waterford city while the increase in Dungarvan was even more dramatic at 55.4%.  This rapidly deteriorating position requires substantial and immediate action.  An urgent first step must be the appointment of a director of employment for the south-east region who would have overall responsibility not only for job creation, but also the power to implement the necessary measures to rapidly reduce the unacceptably high level of unemployment in the area.  Waterford constituency has excellent people and world class expertise but capacity building investment is urgently needed to reverse the avalanche of job losses.  The appointment of a director of employment with real and co-ordinated power to work across a wide range of organisations, sectors and enterprises would be a useful first step.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">The Government decision regarding the south east that most urgently needs attention concerns the upgrading of Waterford Institute of Technology to the university of the south east.  I tabled a parliamentary question today to the Minister for Education and Science asking whether a decision would be reached on the application by 31 December 2008.  However, for the third time this Dáil, he stated in reply that the application would be finalised in the near future.  This is not only an education matter because it is absolutely vital to job creation in the region.  The fact that this matter continues to be long fingered underlines the neglect of the development of Waterford and the south east by the Government parties and the failure to adopt a meaningful strategy for economic and industrial development.  The lack of a university seriously handicaps the region in generating jobs in the sectors where sustainable employment can be created such as the knowledge economy and medical technologies.  These sectors need positive government intervention urgently.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">In recent weeks I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment asking about her strategic plan for the industrial and commercial development of the south east.  Her reply was insipid and lacking in urgency.  Other than platitudinous references to various agencies, it contained no co-ordinated, focused vision indicating the way ahead and this is not acceptable. In repeating my demand for a Government decision on the application of Waterford Institute of Technology for upgrading to university status by year end.  I reiterate my call for the appointment of a director of employment for the region to pull the various elements together in an effective way to begin the region's fight back against rapidly escalating unemployment.</p>

            <p eId="para_972">I was asked by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, to take this Adjournment matter on her behalf and I thank the Deputy for raising it.  Yesterday, I attended with the Deputy a development in his constituency and I was well received by him and all colleagues in the Waterford city area.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">The recent increase in unemployment is unwelcome and is an indication of the challenges that are now facing the labour market and the economy as a whole.  The Government is taking specific measures to address these challenges and to ensure that job losses are minimised as much as possible.  Our priority is to create an environment that will allow those who have lost their jobs to quickly return to the labour market.  The enterprise development agencies along with FÁS are actively engaged in facilitating job opportunities in Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">IDA Ireland's strategy for the Waterford area is to progress the development of a knowledge-based economy so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  The key sectors being targeted are pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, ICT and international financial services.  At present there are 32 IDA Ireland supported companies in Waterford city and county employing approximately 6,416 people.  Since the start of 2008, IDA Ireland has announced the expansion of a number of IDA client companies with a potential to create 485 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">Recent investment announcements for County Waterford include the following.  In April 2008, GlaxoSmithKline, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, announced it is to invest a further €30 million in the expansion of its existing over-the-counter pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in Dungarvan, County Waterford.  This investment will create 50 new high-quality jobs over three years in the production of a product to aid people to quit smoking.  In April 2008, Lancaster Laboratories, one of the largest commercial analytical laboratories in the US, announced it is expanding its operation in Dungarvan, County Waterford, following the acquisition of an Irish company, Microchem Labs in 2007.  Over the next five years, 100 new high-level positions will be created.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">Also in April 2008, Genzyme Ireland announced that it is to invest €130 million to create 170 highly skilled positions and significantly increase the manufacturing capacity at its Waterford facility over the next three years.  The €130 million investment is to expand its sterile fill finish manufacturing operation, introduce soft gel capsule manufacture and create highly skilled positions in manufacturing, quality and engineering.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">In March 2008, Teva Pharmaceuticals, formerly Ivax, announced that it is investing €65 million at its existing facility in Waterford.  The investment will create up to 165 highly-skilled positions over five years in this global pharmaceutical company which specialises in the development, production and marketing of branded and generic pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">As well as marketing the region for new greenfield investment, IDA Ireland continues to work with existing clients to broaden their mandate in Ireland and to continue to re-invest in their sites within the region.  IDA Ireland strongly encourages client companies to invest in research and development and provides a comprehensive research and development package to support this activity.  IDA Ireland continues to develop property solutions to world-class standards appropriate to current trends in foreign direct investment.  To cater for the specialised high quality intensive needs of the biotechnology and ICT sectors, IDA Ireland is in the process of developing a number of large-scale, fully serviced industrial sites throughout the country.  One of these sites is at Belview, Waterford and amounts to 55 hectares.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">As part of the process of developing the capabilities of the region, IDA Ireland works very closely with its partners such as local authorities, Enterprise Ireland and a range of private sector interests who supply business support services throughout the region.  IDA Ireland continues to work closely with the third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high-value-added employment to the region are being developed.  In addition, IDA Ireland maintains a close relationship with FÁS so that the requirements of industry, particularly in the areas of training and up-skilling, are being met.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">Indigenous companies have also added to employment creation in the county over many years, with more than 4,000 employed in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Waterford.  Enterprise Ireland supports the enterprise platform programme, a one-year incubation programme in Waterford Institute of Technology, designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs wanting to set up their own business, by funding eligible participants to attend.  At present 17 candidates are on the programme, which commenced at the end of September 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_984">I thank the Acting Chairman and the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the important issue of South Tipperary General Hospital.  It employs 450 people and has a 275 bed capacity.  More than 1,100 babies were delivered there last year and the level of surgical procedures, including day cases, is extremely high.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">As a teaching hospital which has worked to incorporate changes in work practice and medical standards and has taken on various services following amalgamation with Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel, South Tipperary General Hospital has excelled at every level.  The amalgamation was a major process which took many years and only concluded after the Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, support group took a case to the High Court and secured an agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">Now, many years after this amalgamation, serious concerns are being expressed to me by my constituents with regard to surgery and maternity services at the hospital.  There is great fear among the community.  People are extremely anxious at the prospect of losing some of the many services currently available at South Tipperary General Hospital.  Already cancer services have been moved, with little notice, to Waterford Regional Hospital.  Many people supported this particular decision but they are now dissatisfied with the services that were put in place in Waterford.  The concern is that more services will be transferred in the same manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">The level of efficiency South Tipperary General Hospital has achieved is exceptional.  It works extremely well with community services, the acute care service is particularly good and the maternity service was deemed the second best in the State by patients.  A High Court case was brought to ensure the retention of services at the hospital when changes were made to the level of services at Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel.  The local community is of the view that South Tipperary General Hospital is performing well, efficiently and with a genuine vision for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">Will the Minister of State clarify the situation for hospital staff, patients and the community in south Tipperary?  Will he indicate the Government's future intentions for the hospital?  Some weeks ago, a public meeting was held in Clonmel.  The attendance and level of community awareness indicated the degree of concern among locals.</p>

            <p eId="para_989">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible in an effective and efficient way.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes will be achieved.  It is essential that we prioritise patient safety and quality and that we organise and manage services accordingly.  The priority is to provide safe services as close as possible to where people live.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">The Minister is committed to ensuring the future viability of South Tipperary General Hospital as a health care facility, and the Health Service Executive is working in this policy context.  Beds in the hospital continue to be utilised on a clinical needs basis and general surgery, maternity services and a 24-hour emergency service continue to be provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">South Tipperary General Hospital is a 253-bed hospital providing acute services for a catchment population of some 135,000 in south Tipperary and the bordering areas of north Tipperary and west Waterford.  Acute hospital services in south Tipperary were amalgamated in South Tipperary General Hospital in January 2007, following a major capital development to facilitate the transfer of accident and emergency, general surgery and oncology services from Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, to Clonmel.  The amalgamation process was undertaken successfully and resulted in much improved service delivery arrangements which are beneficial for both patients and health service staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">As part of the Health Service Executive's transformation programme, the configuration of acute hospital services will continue to be reviewed in respect of quality, safety and efficiency.  In this context, it is likely that the services delivered by hospitals will change to reflect a more developed primary care structure, closer integration between acute, primary and community care services at local level and more concentration of complex acute care in regional centres.  The Minister is satisfied that, in this context, South Tipperary General Hospital will continue to play a valuable and significant role in the delivery of health services to its catchment population.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_361">
            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_995">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this serious matter for debate.  I speak on behalf of people who, in many cases, have never been out of work before and who now find themselves suffering financial hardship and pressure for the first time.  These are the people who helped to build the Celtic tiger in the last 15 or 20 years but are described in one newspaper headline today as the new poor.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">Many of them have lost their jobs in the last six months and are in receipt of jobseeker's benefit.  There are several problems in this regard.  First, because of the large number of people affected in this way, there is an ever-increasing delay in processing the claims, with waiting times of up to 12 weeks in some parts of the State.  Second, and this is the main point of tonight's debate, a person must be in receipt of jobseeker's benefit for more than 390 days to qualify for the Christmas bonus payment.  Many of those unfortunate enough to find themselves in these circumstances have paid their taxes, levies and pension contributions throughout their working lives and are simply looking for a helping hand in their hour of need.  In other words, in order to help them over the Christmas period, all they seek is payback for the contributions they have made to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">For example, a constituent of mine, aged 32 years, was made redundant in May for the first time.  She was angry and disaffected to discover some weeks ago that the Christmas bonus covers other categories of unemployed but not her own, even though she has never before received a cent from the State.  She can be forgiven for being angry and baffled, having worked all her life and paid tax and social welfare to support the Exchequer, that she is less entitled to this payment than someone who is long-term unemployed or in receipt of the back to work allowance.  She remarked in an e-mail to me last week that the State does not owe her anything and that she has no desire to milk the system.  All she wants is payback for the contributions she made over the years now that she is in a time of need.  She has made every effort to get a job since being made redundant and she demands equity with other unemployed groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">For young people in particular who have been in employment all their working lives, it is shocking to find themselves out of work and discriminated against in that they are unable to claim benefits that are available to people who have not made as great a contribution to the State.  Many of them are finding it impossible to pay ESB and gas bills, bin charges and so on, while others who have never been in employment are entitled to the bonus.  It has been suggested that such persons may seek assistance from their local community welfare officer.  However, is it reasonable to expect that community welfare officers throughout the State will have the resources to help everybody in this position?  It would be far better to ensure equality in the social welfare system by providing the Christmas bonus to those in receipt of the jobseeker's benefit.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_999">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin.  The Christmas bonus is paid to all recipients of long-term social welfare payments.  The payment was made during the first week of December, at an estimated cost of €201 million.  Some 1.3 million persons, comprising 940,000 recipients and 400,000 dependants, benefited from the payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">The focus of the bonus has always been on persons who rely on the social welfare system for financial support in the long term.  These include recipients of State pension, transition; State pension, contributory and non-contributory; blind pension; widow's, widower's and invalidity pensions; guardian's payment, contributory and non-contributory; one-parent family payment; carer's benefit and allowance; disability allowance; jobseeker's allowance in respect of a continuous period of unemployment of at least 15 months in duration; pre-retirement allowance; farm assist and people in receipt of employment support payments.  The bonus is also payable to recipients of certain income support payments administered by the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is also payable to participants in the rural social scheme, which was introduced in 2004, and operates under the aegis of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">The estimated cost of extending the payment to recipients of jobseekers benefit is an additional €33 million.  There are no plans at present to amend or extend entitlement to the bonus payment to these schemes and any such extension could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to the resources available and the significant cost which would be involved.</p>

            <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_1005">I watched an episode of "Prime Time" last week, a programme which the public broadcaster, RTE, claimed would reveal something hugely problematic for society and the management of the regeneration process in inner city Dublin.  It was most disappointing.  One expected to be confronted with some huge revelations but, in fact, it was pure hype.  There was nothing in the programme worth listening to or discussing.  Obviously, there is a planning dispute but that is the start and end of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The real pity is that the programme conveyed an image of the docklands authority as somehow failing in its duty and role in the regeneration of inner city Dublin.  That could not be further from the truth.  Since its establishment in 1997, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has transformed people's lives.  It has made a huge difference in terms of social and affordable housing.  People have been moved from substandard accommodation that should have been knocked down years ago to modern, bright, healthy and sustainable accommodation.  That is due to the docklands authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">The authority has tried to embrace the entire community in the area by including and consulting with everybody, be they young or old.  Visit the schools, parks and community centres throughout the docklands areas, north and south, and see how they have been touched by the authority through the services supplied and delivered to the communities in the area.  Recently I passed a pub on the quays, The Ferryman.  Ten or 15 years ago one would have wondered what the man was doing, trying to run a pub in the godforsaken area.  Clearly, the area has changed and in a positive way.  The impression given by RTE, the public service broadcaster, should not prevail.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">The education brief of the docklands authority is most impressive.  It is involved with the School Principals' Forum and has a drama in the schools programme, a parents in education programme, a literacy programme and third level scholarship programmes.  The docklands is a good news story.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_367">
            <from>Deputy Cyprian Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_1009">I support my colleague.  I have spent many years in the area on the north side of the Liffey.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority has transformed the lives of people in inner city areas, and not just in respect of housing.  There is a new community there that has integrated very successfully with the traditional community.  That is solely due to the efforts of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">The authority is not just involved in housing.  It has educational and social programmes and has provided many facilities in the area.  These are used by the communities on both sides of the Liffey.  The area has experienced tremendous changes.  When one sees efforts to denigrate what is probably the most successful regeneration programme the country has ever had, one wonders where we are going.  I invite people to visit the docklands on the north and south sides of the Liffey to see the difference.  I see it in the children living in these areas.  They are now more confident.  There was a very bad incident at the weekend and the community is in shock, but the fact that the development authority is there and is involved so closely with the communities strengthens them and ensures there is a future for these children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">We are in a position to assist these areas after many generations of unemployment and deprivation.  Children now have an opportunity to finish their schooling, progress to third level education and ultimately have the possibility of a job.  That was never the case in these areas previously.  For many years they experienced dereliction, unemployment and deprivation.  That has changed and that is due to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_1012">I thank Deputies Chris Andrews and Cyprian Brady for raising this matter.  I am pleased to be able to respond positively to this motion, which recognises the solid work that has been undertaken by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority since its establishment in 1997 in managing the physical, economic and social regeneration of more than 500 hectares of the docklands.  The success of the authority in tackling physical dereliction, lack of investment, inadequate infrastructure and facilities, housing shortfall, poor educational attainment and social isolation is striking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">Some key facts and statistics indicate the extent of the docklands transformation within the past decade.  There are now more than 22,000 people living in the docklands, an increase of nearly 30%.  The number of people employed has almost doubled to approximately 40,000.  More than 750,000 sq. m. of commercial space has been permitted, 25% of the total office development in Dublin since 2002 was in the docklands and more than 5,000 housing units have been constructed and 11,000 housing units will have been delivered by 2012.  Of these, 20% will be allocated to social and affordable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">Some landmark projects completed in recent years, under way or in the immediate pipeline include: Grand Canal square and theatre, the national conference centre, the Docklands Station at Sheriff Street, the expansion of the Point Theatre and development of the Point Village, the Sean O'Casey and Samuel Beckett bridges, the campshires and the 1 km long Royal Canal linear park.  Social regeneration has been as important as physical development.  The key to this is investment in education and equal opportunity.  More than 30 education programmes are running in docklands schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">The authority is a progressive body, with a clear vision.  Building on the success of the past decade and following extensive stakeholder consultation and wide public engagement, the council of the authority within the past fortnight has unanimously adopted a 2008 master plan under which programmes, projects and policies will be rolled out for the next phase of this regeneration project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">Overall, the docklands continues to be among the largest areas of the city with the opportunity of achieving a sustainable built environment where living, working and leisure can be integrated in a distinct, high quality and coherent urban quarter served by modern public transport infrastructure.  There are challenges ahead and the economic downturn will have an effect on the pace of development and present challenges in attracting new businesses.  It also remains important to attract more families into the docklands and integrate them successfully with existing communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">I have every confidence in the capacity of the authority fully to address its regeneration objectives and my Department will continue strongly to support its endeavours.  I am pleased to have accepted an invitation from the authority to address its sixth social regeneration conference next January.  The theme of the conference, which is likely to be attended by several hundred delegates from local community groups, local State bodies and the business community is, fittingly, Continuity of Delivery, with a special focus on education and quality of life.  I look forward to engaging with the authority and all the stakeholders at the conference.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">I again thank Deputies Chris Andrews and Cyprian Brady for raising this matter in the House.  I am confident in the ability of the authority, assisted by interaction between the political system, Dublin City Council and others, to advance this project, which continues to have the support of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1039">The Live Register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming Jobseekers Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance and other registrants as registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office.  The most recent information is for November 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">The table below contains the number of persons signing on in County Kildare for each month from January 2003 to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">It should be noted that the Live Register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, and seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1145">While IDA Ireland's primary role is the attraction of high quality FDI to Ireland, an integral and fundamental element of this role is the Agency's mandate to promote sustainable and balanced regional development.  However, the marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">The National Spatial Strategy provides a backdrop for IDA's regional strategy and the alignment of these strategies is endorsed in the current NDP.  As part of this strategy IDA is actively promoting the South West region (which includes locations such as Dunmanway, Bandon, Macroom, Millstreet, Clonakilty, Skibbereen and Bantry) to prospective investors across the full range of IDA targeted sectors.  There are currently 134 IDA assisted companies in County Cork employing in excess of 20,000 people. There are several IDA client companies located throughout the West Cork area in sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information &amp; Communications Technologies (ICT) and Internationally Traded Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">West Cork does benefit from the presence of foreign direct investment in the broader region. The challenge is to mobilise resources and stakeholders on a regional, rather than on a purely local basis, so as to compete effectively with other city regions.  While IDA Ireland continues to host company visits across the region, ultimately it is the investor who decides where to locate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1154">FÁS has informed me that it has made payments to business organisations and trade unions for the provision of training programmes under the Competency Development Programme and under the Community Employment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">As part of the Competency Development Programme, FÁS has contractual agreements or "Strategic Alliances" with a number of business representative organisations and trade unions.  These contracts are for the development and delivery of training and for the provision of related supports, examples of which include the establishment of a union learning network and the appointment and subsequent training of individuals to act as local union learning advocates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">There are a number of controls in place to ensure that funds are spent on the purpose for which they were intended.  I am informed by FAS that it is standard practice that contracts are the subject of a comprehensive tendering process and are subsequently approved by the Board of FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">In addition, I understand from FAS that normally the amounts paid are based on the value of each contract, and a pre-determined rate per training day is paid in arrears on receipt of an invoice from the trainer for a specific number of training days.  The trainer is required to supply the name and PPS number of each individual participant trained along with over 30 other necessary items of information.  In addition, in some cases funding is also provided for training resource or course development and other related support mechanisms as detailed in each individual contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">Furthermore, my Department is currently undertaking a Value for Money review of the FAS Competency Development Programme. This review is examining the various strands of the Competency Development Programme including the Strategic Alliance initiatives detailed above. It is expected that this review will be completed in the first quarter of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">I have also been informed by FÁS that they monitor projects under the Community Employment Scheme to ensure that monies are spent appropriately.  Under the Community Employment scheme FÁS currently funds 23 Community Employment schemes sponsored by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to assist in running their resource centres for the unemployed.  There are a total of 515 participants on these schemes.  The budget for these schemes covers allowances, training and materials, and is not paid to ICTU but to the specific project, which has its own Board of Management.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_1161">The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were set up in 1993 to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  The forms of direct financial assistance (Measure 1), which are available to project promoters, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants, and Feasibility Study Grants.  The forms of non-financial assistance or soft supports (Measure 2) assistance available from CEBs cover such programmes as Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education and Women in Business networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">The total allocation to cover all 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) in 2008 is €31.7m of which some €18m is available for Capital expenditure while €13.7m is available for Administration (pay and non-pay) purposes of which €13.5m was allocated directly to the Boards.  In addition, an extra capital provision of €2.5m has been secured out of money carried over from 2007 under the carryover of unspent capital provision to cover CEBs' enterprise education programmes and Tech-Check activities.  The cost of administering the CEB network is primarily made up of payroll costs and associated expenditure such as office accommodation, lighting, heating, stationery supplies etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">The focus of CEB activity has been increasingly on the provision of "soft" supports — management training, mentoring, advisory and information services, etc.  A significant allocation is made to the CEBs each year for the provision of these soft support or Measure 2 activities.  These activities are considerably more labour intensive than processing grant applications and a very significant portion of CEB staff time is taken up with the organisation and delivery of such activities.  In addition, CEB staff would be engaged on a daily basis in the provision of an informal information and advisory service to local entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">The statistical information sought by the Deputy is in tabular format below.  Figures in relation to grants to business are collated on an annual basis at year-end.  Accordingly 2008 figures are not yet available for these activities.  I have however set out figures in respect of 2007 for the Deputy's information.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1422">Shannon Development is funded by a combination of Exchequer funding and own resource income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">My Department provides funding to Shannon Development, through its Estimate to fund grants to industry in the Shannon Free Zone.  The allocation for 2007 was €3m but due to the demand led nature of the process just €551,000 of this was drawn down.  The allocation for 2008 is €3m. While there is a nominal provision in my Department's Estimate for Shannon Development Pay and Administration, in practice, this is wholly funded from the Company's own resource income and there has been no requirement to draw down funding from this source for the past ten years or so. The Department of Tourism provided grant-in-aid of €845,000 in 2007 for administration and general expenses (tourism development) in 2007 and the corresponding allocation for 2008 is €870,000 towards tourism activities in the region i.e. operation of tourist information offices, tourism marketing and product development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">The Company's own resource income is generated mainly from its management of state property assets in the mid-west region. Rental income and service charge income is generated from the Company's property portfolio and contributed €17m to the overall funding in 2007.  The balance of €1.5m of own resource funding is generated from tourist information office sales, deposit interest and other miscellaneous income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">Shannon Castle Banquets &amp; Heritage Ltd, a subsidiary company of Shannon Development generated income of approximately €13m in 2007 with costs of roughly the same amount.  This company is essentially in a break even situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">Shannon Development, in common with all Government Departments and state agencies, were required to effect specified levels of savings in their pay costs, consultancy/advertising etc.  Discussions are ongoing between my department and Shannon Development on the mechanisms necessary to achieve these savings. The following table analyses Shannon Development's expenditure for 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1474">On 22nd October last I met with representatives of the Irish Hotels Federation where I heard at first hand of the difficulties being experienced by hotels with regard to wage costs and, in particular, the issue of premium payments for Sunday work.  At that meeting I advised the Federation to make their concerns known through their representatives at the social partnership table and to pursue the issues actively through the established mechanism of the Hotels Joint Labour Committee, where the terms and conditions of employment for workers in the sector are established.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">I welcome the recent agreement by the representative employer and trade union organisations in this sector to establish a Forum to contribute to the development of a sustainable industry providing high quality employment in the Hotel sector. The Forum consists of representatives of IBEC and the Irish Hotels Federation (IHF), on behalf of employers in the industry and SIPTU. This Forum will have regard to a wide range of employment and industrial relations issues arising from the current challenges facing the hotels sector, with priority attention to be given to the current challenges as a result of the operation of the JLC system (with particular reference to premium payments in the sector).</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">I welcome the initiative of the Social Partners in this area and I hope that constructive dialogue will result in practical measures to help address the severe challenges facing those working in the hospitality sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1609">Two Industrial Development agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with Louth Couth Enterprise Board are responsible for inward investment and indigenous enterprise development in County Louth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">The County of Louth has a large concentration of IDA Ireland supported companies with nineteen clients employing nearly 2,200 people.  The agency owns a total of 250 acres in the County.  In order to cater for the specialised high utility intensive needs of the Biotechnology and ICT sectors, IDA Ireland is in the process of developing a number of large scale, fully-serviced industrial sites throughout the country.  One of these sites is at Mullagharlin to the south of Dundalk.  The site amounts to 150 acres in two parcels of 110 acres and 40 acres  and is particularly targeted at Bio Pharma type activities.  A €10m investment programme on the site has been completed.  Planning Permission has been sought from Louth County Council for two generic bio Pharma facilities and ancillary offices and a notice of intention to grant planning has been received.  In Drogheda, IDA Ireland has completed the development of a 63 acre site and construction of the first office building of approximately 23,000 sq. ft. on the Park has been finished.  The agency has planning permission in place for over 120,000 sq. ft. of office facilities on the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">There are 169 Enterprise Ireland companies employing 4,750 in Co. Louth.  So far this year, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of €4.1m to companies in the County and paid a total of €1.8m.  Enterprise Ireland has already provided funding of €2,26m to six Enterprise Centres across the County.  In the 2008 Call for Proposals, there were three applicants for funding for new Enterprise Centres in the County.  Two Enterprise Centres were approved — one for Drogheda (Drogheda &amp; District Chamber of Commerce, Newsroom and Library Ltd) and one for Dundalk  (Louth Craftmark Ltd) to be located in Muirhevnamor, Dundalk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">Louth County Enterprise Board is supporting individuals, firms and community groups where projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support, such as advice, mentoring and training programmes, the CEB remains central in assisting many micro-enterprises in developing their growth potential.  I am satisfied that the policies and initiatives being adopted will continue to bring industry and jobs to County Louth.</p>

            <p eId="para_1617">Two Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with the relevant County Enterprise Boards (CEBs), are responsible for enterprise development in the areas in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">At present, there are 47 IDA Ireland supported companies in the Midlands region, employing over 5,300 people.  Enterprise Ireland has 33 client companies in the region employing over 4,200 people.  During 2007, the CEBs in the region paid out over €1.48m in grant assistance to 109 clients.  This assisted in the creation of 236 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">There are 71 IDA Ireland supported companies in the Western region, employing over 12,500 in permanent jobs and 2,500 in temporary and contract employment.  Enterprise Ireland has 26 client companies in the region, employing over 3,400 people.  During 2007, the CEBs in the region paid out over €1.11m in grant assistance to 104 clients.  This assisted in the creation of 328 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">The Industrial Development agencies and the CEBs in the two regions are continuing to support enterprise development through the provision of both direct financial assistance (in the form of capital, feasibility and employment grants) and through indirect or soft support assistance such as management development, capability support and the development and delivery of activities to highlight and promote enterprise.  In February of this year, details were announced of Enterprise Ireland's €50m fund to boost regional economic development to be delivered through Galway Mayo Institute of Technology and Athlone Institute of Technology together with 12 other Institutes of Technology.  The agency has also approved support for over 30 Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) in both the Western and Midland regions.  A further €2m was approved recently by EI for CEC development in the two regions. The agency also recently ran two Enterprise Start Programmes in Tullamore and Galway with a total of 60 potential entrepreneurs participating.  These events were  designed to promote entrepreneurship and facilitate people thinking about starting a high growth business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">Through its network of overseas offices, IDA Ireland is actively marketing the Midland and Western regions for new inward investment across a range of sectors.  In addition, the agency supports enterprise development in the regions through its ongoing strategy of growing and embedding foreign direct investment activity.  The agency actively encourages its client companies to add strategic functions to their Irish operations in areas such as research and development and marketing.  The agency also works closely with education institutions in the regions, in developing the skills necessary to attract high value added employment and, with the Industrial Training agency FÁS, to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in up-skilling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">I am satisfied that the policies and initiatives being adopted will continue to bring jobs and  industrial development to these regions.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_1624">The current financial situation is challenging for SMEs. I have met with the SFA and ISME to discuss a range of issues of concern to the SME sector. A primary concern is access to bank credit.  The banking sector is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D. My officials and I have been working closely with the Minister and officials of his Department on encouraging the banks to assume their responsibility to provide support to economic development and in particular, to provide credit to SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">The Deputy will no doubt be aware that a number of banks have over the last week, announced significant financial lending packages to assist SMEs. In addition, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has indicated that it is in discussions with four Irish banks in relation to its recently announced €30 billion facility to provide loans to SMEs through commercial banks. I very much welcome these important developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">My  Department and its Agencies will continue to play an important role in working through the current economic situation, and in making sure that we are well positioned to reap the benefits that will undoubtedly arise when the situation improves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">My Department's continuous support for indigenous companies arises through maintaining a positive business environment and through particular interventions from the State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County and City Enterprise Boards.  The significant allocations in my Department's Estimates for 2009, will ensure that we continue to build on this strategy for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">Enterprise Ireland is the agency with responsibility for supporting the development of Irish companies with ambitions to grow in world markets. Many of its client companies are small to medium in size. Enterprise Ireland recognises the varied challenges facing such companies in the context of the changing economic environment and partners with companies to address their needs in a holistic manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">In addition to EI, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards provide support to small businesses or micro-enterprises with 10 employees or less.  CEB funding will increase next year by almost €3 million, or 9%, to €34.8 million and this represents a further indication of the Government's commitment to supporting this sector of business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">FÁS through their One Step Up programme is encouraging employees to increase their competency levels and promoting an ethos of lifelong learning in the workplace. Its key intervention in this regard is the Competency Development Programme.  It offers workers different types of training programmes directed at various skill levels across major economic sectors. These training programmes are available to employees of SMEs.  FÁS also have a number of other training programmes aimed at upskilling SME's namely, Skillnets and FÁS Strategic Alliance programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">The Government has also made very considerable progress on the implementation of the Small Business Forum Report's recommendations. This progress is reflected through a substantial package of financial measures and schemes introduced to assist the sector over the last two years, including fiscal measures in the 2007 and 2008 Finance Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">SMEs are central to our economic development and the range of measures and supports outlined above will continue to help the sector adapt to the current economic climate.  These measures will be kept under review to ensure that they remain appropriate to the current circumstances.</p>

         the number of times she has met with Minister Arlene Foster in 2008 to discuss the integration of the two commercial zones on this island; her views on the Hain-Ahern 2006 assertion that companies should be encouraged to redesign logistical strategies and treat Ireland as one commercial zone rather than two separate entities; the action her Department has taken in 2008 to progress Strand II of the Good Friday Agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1636">I had one meeting with Minister Foster since my appointment as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment during which we discussed a range of economic issues affecting the economy of both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. These discussions form part of an ongoing process of North/South co-operation to strengthen our economic development in order to gain competitive advantage in response to the ever-changing global opportunities and challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">The groundbreaking Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy, to which the Deputy refers, was published in 2006 and sets out a strong rationale for beneficial all-island economic activity. The strategic context for North/South co-operation, which is outlined in the study, highlights the "market widening effect" of  a larger market on the island of Ireland, where previously unexplored business opportunities are exploited and companies may redesign their logistical strategies to respond to these business opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">InterTradeIreland, the all-island trade and business development body which is jointly sponsored by my Department and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, has a central role to play in helping businesses North and South to tap into the all-island market place. It is implementing a wide range of North/South programmes, which provide opportunities for businesses to improve their competitive performance, and these include technology transfer, sales and marketing, sectoral business networks and promoting equity finance to accelerate business growth. It also undertakes vital research, provides information and offers advice to companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">In relation to the Good Friday Agreement, a meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in the trade and business development sector took place on the 29 May to review the ongoing work of InterTradeIreland and to approve its three-year corporate plan and business plan for 2008. In addition there is ongoing co-operation between my Department and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland on enterprise issues. A significant number of North/South initiatives, which were envisaged in the Comprehensive Study, have been implemented such as the launch of the all-island Innovation Voucher Scheme, an all-island approach to labour market skills forecasting, the participation of companies from the North in trade missions organised by Enterprise Ireland and the North West Gateway Initiative, which is a joint strategic approach by both administrations to the development needs of the North West.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">I am convinced that mutual benefits will continue to accrue to the economy of both jurisdictions by pursuing the pragmatic co-operation that is outlined in the Comprehensive Study.</p>

            <p eId="para_1675">Section 11 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 provides that the following two conditions must apply for a cessation of work to be regarded as a lay off.  Firstly, that it is reasonable in the circumstances for the employer to believe that the cessation of employment will not be permanent, and, secondly, that the employer gives notice to that effect to the employee prior to the cessation.  The legislation also provides that disputes in relation to the operation of the Redundancy Payments Acts should be made to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">Section 5(6) of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, states that the non-payment of wages properly payable by an employer on any occasion will be regarded as an unlawful deduction.  Complaints in relation to matters under this legislation may be made to the Rights Commissioner Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), who are responsible for monitoring compliance with Employment Rights Legislation, can provide additional information on employment rights obligations and entitlements.  NERA can be contacted by telephone on 1890 80 80 90 (Lo call) while the Authority's website, www.employmentrights.ie, could also be usefully consulted.  NERA has confirmed that it has no record of an inspection on this company.</p>

            <p eId="para_1778">Employment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey or QNHS and published by the CSO.  The latest release provides data for Quarter 3, June-August 2008 which indicates that there are 2,120,800 in employment.  This reflects a decrease in employment in the year of 25,200 or 1.2%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">The drop in employment, while regrettable, must be seen in the light of the unprecedented growth in the economy and in employment in the past number of years.  Overall employment growth was driven by significant growth in employment in the construction sector.  Such levels of growth could not last indefinitely.  The resultant rise in unemployment is now compounded by the downturn in the global economy and a general slowdown in employment in all sectors.  Ireland is not alone in finding itself in this position, indeed many countries throughout Europe and around the world are experiencing similar difficulties in their labour markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">The Government is taking specific measures to address this challenge and to ensure that job losses are minimised as much as possible and for as short a time as possible.  The enterprise development agencies, along with FÁS the employment and training authority, are actively engaged in facilitating job opportunities throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1785">The Irish economy is now one of the most globalised in the world.  As a consequence, the uncertainty created by the current international financial crisis has had a significant impact on our economy.  Our comparative advantage will increasingly lie in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services.  With that in mind, a range of policies are being pursued to enhance competitiveness and improve the business environment for both manufacturing and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">Maintaining the competitiveness of the enterprise sector in Ireland is a priority issue for my Department and our development agencies.  In order to sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">The "Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing", launched earlier this year, identified the focused actions needed by employers, employees and Government to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland.  The report contains 26 recommendations directed at key areas of  innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development for the innovative firm, increasing awareness and take up of existing supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">The Social Partners agreed, as part of the recently concluded review of "Towards 2016", that a Manufacturing Forum should be established, in line with the recommendations of the High Level Group on Manufacturing.  This matter is currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Social Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">We continue to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries.  Over the next ten years, services will be one of the key drivers of Ireland's economic success and job creation.  The report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland", sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential. Implementation of the recommendations of the Services Strategy Group — some of which are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies — will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">I recently launched Enterprise Ireland's strategy for the internationalisation of Ireland's services sector, which the agency estimates could yield up to €1.14bn in new export sales for Ireland by 2010, and a doubling of exports sales in this sector to €5.25bn by 2015.  I also announced Enterprise Ireland's new "Going Global Fund" — a €3m government fund specifically aimed at locally traded companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland and wish to explore opportunities to sell abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">The economic environment is more challenging than we have seen for many years, however we have the foundations in place for long term economic growth through the adoption of this series of proactive policies and strategies that best serve the interests of the manufacturing and services sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1793">Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey or QNHS and published by the Central Statistics Office.  The numbers unemployed are not broken down on a sectoral basis.  However, data on redundancies is available by sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">Employment/unemployment fluctuations and redundancy data for the years 2004 to 2008 are set out in the following table.  The data above reflect the fact that while there was some increase in unemployment in the years up to end 2007, the increase in employment significantly outweighed it.  Also, though redundancies occurred each year, the number of new jobs being created resulted in job losses being absorbed in the buoyant labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">The data for 2008 reflects the reality that we are now in a period of economic downturn which is impacting negatively on our labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1835">Employment data in respect of agency assisted companies are collated on an annual basis and as such it is not possible to supply figures in respect of jobs created to date for 2008.  The table below sets out the number of jobs created in enterprise agency assisted firms (IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development) broken down by sector for the year 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">Over the last number of years we have experienced significant churn in employment particularly in the manufacturing sector which has seen a number of job losses in the more traditional areas of manufacturing.  However many of these jobs have been replaced by higher value added activities both in manufacturing and the services sector. The Irish economy is undergoing a certain amount of adjustment and while the rate of employment growth is expected to slow, it must be viewed in the context of historically unprecedented numbers of people in work.  Since 1997, over half a million new jobs have been created in Ireland and the number in employment exceeds 2.1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">The economic environment is more challenging than we have seen for many years, however we have the foundations in place for long term economic growth through proactive policies such as the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation, the National Skills Strategy and the National Development Plan.  Ireland is well placed to tackle the challenges we are facing, with a strong base of modern industry, a highly skilled and flexible workforce and a pro-business culture.  We continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, in line with the NDP and the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">The social partners agreed as part of the recently concluded review of "Towards 2016", that a Manufacturing Forum should be established in line with the recommendations of the High Level Group on Manufacturing.  This matter is currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the social partners.  The implementation of the recommendations set out in this report will help to ensure that manufacturing will remain an integral component of our economy providing high value sustainable employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">In tandem with our focus on adding value to the manufacturing sector, over the last two decades we have developed a very significant services sector which now employs two out of every three Irish workers.  We are one of the world's leading service exporting countries and currently ranked the tenth highest exporter of services in the world.  I recently launched the report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland".  The report sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector.  I believe that the implementation of these recommendations will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others which will lead to significant employment opportunities for our workforce.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1852">I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 158 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">Ireland is no longer a low cost economy and therefore we must seek to develop economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage.  While the economic environment is more challenging than we have seen for many years, we have the foundations in place for long-term economic growth through proactive policies such as the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation, the National Skills Strategy and the National Development Plan.  Ireland is well placed to tackle the challenges we are facing, with a strong base of modern industry, a highly skilled and flexible workforce and a pro-business culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">Innovation and the productivity gains that flow from it are the foundations for maintaining competitiveness.  Enhancing productivity growth is the cornerstone of our competitiveness.  The Enterprise Development Agencies under my Department (SFI, EI, IDA and CCEBs) have a capital allocation of €495 million in 2009, which will be spent on productivity enhancing investments such as R&amp;D, innovation, better use of ICT, and training and management development.  In addition, part of our long term strategy for achieving productivity improvements is to enhance the skills of the Irish workforce, as set out in the National Skills Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">In the shorter term, the next few years can be seen as a period of opportunity as we seek to re-situate ourselves in terms of our national competitiveness, and to place ourselves in the optimal position to benefit from the eventual upturn in the international economy as well as from our longer-term investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">IDA Ireland has continued to be successful in attracting new investment to Ireland, even in the current economic climate.  Since the beginning of November alone, it has made announcements which are expected to provide a total of 1,000 new jobs in a variety of sectors, across a range of skills (such as manufacturing, R&amp;D and European Headquarters operations) and spread throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">We are working consistently and successfully to build Irish exports in world markets.  For example, contracts worth €40 million in new export sales have been signed by Irish companies during the recent Enterprise Ireland trade mission which I led, to the United Arab Emirates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">In order to sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.  I intend to establish shortly a new High Level Manufacturing Forum to progress the recommendations contained in the Manufacturing Report published last April and recently agreed by the Social Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">In the future, the major impetus for growth will come from expansion of our services sectors.  Last September, I launched the report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland".  Ireland is already the tenth highest exporter of services in the world.  This report will guide the development of our services policies and strategy into the future, with a view to fully exploiting the opportunities that this sector presents.  In particular, the strategy will focus on maximising the performance of companies that are already active on export markets, on encouraging companies that are currently only trading locally to expand their markets abroad, and on fostering a new breed of start-up services companies with exporting potential.  My Department is working in conjunction with other Departments to progress the implementation of these recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">While any job losses are regrettable, and are deeply distressing for those concerned, we must remember that we still have a historically high number of people at work today compared to a decade ago — over 2 million — and that we are still creating high-value jobs across the economy. Through our pro-enterprise policies, ongoing investment in critical infrastructure under the NDP, our low taxes on business and workers and our balanced regulatory regime, the government are committed to ensuring that we continue to build an environment for enterprise that remains among the most favourable in the world.</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         the steps she has taken or will take to discourage the relocation of manufacturing or service jobs to lower cost economies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1862">Decisions to relocate companies or elements of their supply chain are a reality of the modern globalised economic environment.  Companies adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology in addition to business takeovers and consolidations.  Such decisions inevitably result in flows of investment and employment across borders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">Ireland is no longer a low cost economy and therefore we must seek to develop economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage.  The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world.  While competition from emerging markets for FDI has intensified, Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is strong.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">Irish companies also benefit substantially from globalisation as new markets and business opportunities open up.  While off-shoring can contribute to job losses for firms in some sectors, productivity gains achieved through off-shoring some activities represents an opportunity to develop higher-end manufacturing and related activities domestically.  Irish enterprises are adapting to the changing model of manufacturing in developed countries through increased productivity, technology levels and the enhanced skills of Irish employees.  Innovation, and the productivity gains that flow from it are the new foundations for competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">The "Report of the High-Level Group on Manufacturing" contains some 26 recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development, which will ensure Irish manufacturers, can continue to compete successfully on international markets and provide high value sustainable employment.  The group also recommended the establishment of a Manufacturing Forum, to take responsibility for progressing the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the report, this matter is currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Social Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">We continue to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries.  The report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland", sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential.  Implementation of the recommendations– some of which are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies — will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">I recently launched Enterprise Ireland's strategy for the internationalisation of Ireland's services sector, which the agency estimates could yield up to €1.14bn in new export sales for Ireland by 2010, and a doubling of exports sales in this sector to €5.25bn by 2015.  On the same day I announced Enterprise Ireland's new "Going Global Fund" — a €3m government fund specifically aimed at locally traded companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland and wish to explore opportunities to sell abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced, prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy, and consequently less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences.</p>

            <p eId="para_1870">Over the last five years the contribution of net exports to Irish economic growth has fluctuated year on year.  In 2003 it was +1.49%; in 2004 +0.43%; in 2005 it was negative, at -1.29%; in 2006 +0.21% and in 2007 net exports contributed +2.64% to economic growth.  For the first half of 2008 the relevant figure was +1.42%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">In the calendar years 2003-2007, annual growth in total Irish exports has averaged 6.74%, while imports rose by an average of 8.23%.  In relation to merchandise exports, the growth has averaged 2.07%, while services exports grew at an average of 15.33% during this period.  The corresponding average figure for the increase in merchandise imports was 7.25%, while services imports averaged an increase of 9.19%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">Services exports have risen steadily from being 31% of total exports in 2003 to 42% in 2007.  Of our total exports of €154.73 billion in 2007, our trade surplus was €26,043 billion.  This very positive trend was achieved despite poor economic growth in many of our trading partners and also against the backdrop of adverse exchange rate trends in our two biggest export markets, the United States and the United Kingdom, due to the rise of the Euro against both the US Dollar and Sterling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">The latest available merchandise trade data for the period up to August 2008 shows that for January-August this year, when compared to the same period in 2007, exports fell by 4%, with a 7% fall in imports.  The CSO's figures also show that services exports for the six months ending June 2008 (latest available), when compared to the same period for 2007, rose by4.65%, while imports were up 8.23%.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1875">FÁS and Skillnets are tailoring their provision to respond to the present economic environment.  FÁS is responsible for providing training to people seeking employment and to people already in employment.  FÁS training provision can be divided into three main areas: training under FÁS Community Services Division, training provided by FÁS Training Services and training to people in employment provided under the Competency Development Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">FÁS Community Services Division provides training to enhance the employability and mobility of disadvantaged and unemployed persons.  It currently provides training to approximately 30,000 participants across seven major programmes.  These include the Community Employment scheme, which currently has 22,128 participants, training provided by Community Training Centres, which have a national capacity of 2,300 places and currently are providing training to in excess of 1,800 people; training delivered under the Local Training Initiative, which provides community based training and work experience to people who are distant from the labour market and under which, FÁS expect to train approximately 2,800 people this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1877">FÁS have informed me that it is budgeting to maintain the same numbers of participants/trainees on its Community Services programmes in 2009 as was budgeted in 2008.  Last month the FÁS Board approved two initiatives to enable FÁS Training Services to increase their provision of training so as to meet the increasing demand for their services particularly from those who are now unemployed.  Currently, FÁS caters for approximately 8,000 participants through its night classes programme.  As a result of last month's Board decision FÁS will provide an additional 16,000 night class places next year and these will be available free of charge to people who are unemployed.  These courses will be certified and will enable individuals to quickly upskill, enhance their employability and allow them to re-enter the labour market in another sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1878">The FÁS Board also approved an initiative aimed at delivering 6,000 places specifically aimed at short courses next year.  These courses, which will be certified are aimed at individuals who have become unemployed and do not wish to avail of the traditional full length FÁS programme.  In addition, FÁS Training Services will expand its range and capacity of On-Line and Blended Learning by 8,000 places during 2009 to meet increasing demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">Last year under the FÁS Competency Development Programme approximately 45,000 people in employment received training.  It is expected that a similar number will have received training by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">Under the Skillnets Training Network Programme 2009 it is estimated that in excess of 24,000 people in employment will receive training or upskilling across some 117 training networks nationally.  This is estimated to result in circa 130,000 training days.  The National Training Fund is providing €24.8m under the programme in 2009.  An element of this budget has been set aside to address particular training needs in the financial services sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">As the Skillnets model is enterprise-led and market driven it can react swiftly to changing enterprise needs and prevailing economic circumstances.  Skillnets objective is to enhance the skills and employability of more vulnerable members in the workforce with an emphasis on the low skilled. Individual skillnets networks determine the type, form and content of training and development programmes in line with the requirements of the particular sector or region and in response to changing market conditions.  This affords the skillnets maximum flexibility in tailoring training to meet particular needs. In this context all skillnets, many of whom comprise small to medium enterprises, are currently fine-tuning their training programmes to meet the prevailing national and global economic circumstances anticipated next year.</p>

         the number of jobs lost and created in County Kildare in the past 12 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1883">Employment/unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey (June-August 2008), published by the CSO.  It does not provide data on particular counties but only on Regions.  Employment in the Mid East Region, which includes Kildare, has dropped by 3,200 and unemployment has increased by 6,600 in the year to Quarter 3 2008 (June-August).</p>
            <p eId="para_1884">The recent increase in the numbers unemployed is unwelcome and is an indication of the challenges that are now facing the labour market and that are within the economy as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">The Government is taking specific measures to address this challenge and to ensure that job losses are minimised as much as possible and for as short a time as possible.  The enterprise development agencies, along with FÁS the employment and training authority, are actively engaged in facilitating job opportunities in Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">At present there are 25 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kildare employing approximately 10,356 people.  Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies including Wyeth Medica, Braun Oral B, Intel and Hewlett Packard.  The Millennium Park in Naas has three modern 40,000 sq.ft. advance office buildings which are now available for marketing to inward investors, with  all the necessary infrastructure, including ducting for broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">New indigenous companies have also been established and have created new employment in the county.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1890">There are many factors apart from costs that influence a firm's decision to relocate, therefore, it is not possible to determine the number of jobs which may have been lost to lower cost economies.  Decisions to relocate companies or elements of their supply chain are a reality of the modern globalised economic environment.  Companies adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology, in addition to business takeovers and consolidations. Such decisions inevitably result in flows of investment and employment across borders.  In the main, Ireland successfully manages this process, through our policies on enterprise and foreign direct investment.  These policies, such as competitive tax rates, investment in skills, education and R&amp;D and investing in critical physical and communications infrastructure, have positioned us to win many prestigious and high value added investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">Ireland has not been a low cost economy for some time now, and manufacturers in particular have been facing increased competition from producers in lower cost economies.  The manufacturing sector in Ireland has evolved noticeably since 2000, in terms of the composition of industry and the nature of activities, and is likely to continue to do so.  The model of manufacturing in developed economies has changed and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace.  Irish based manufacturing enterprises will have to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and to increase productivity through investments in people, technology and innovation.  Innovation, and the productivity gains that flow from it are the new foundations for competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world.  While competition from emerging markets for FDI has intensified, Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is strong.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">One of the Government's main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education, lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility, in line with the NDP and the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1894">Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy, and consequently less likely to move, on the basis of simple cost influences.</p>

            <p eId="para_1896">Two Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with the local County Enterprise Board (CEB) are responsible for enterprise development in County Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">As recently as last Friday, I was in Maynooth for the formal launch of Sentenial, an Enterprise Ireland client company.  This company has grown from some 30 people in a very short time to almost 70 people now and has plans to expand further.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">The consumer foods sector has shown rapid growth in the County in recent years.  Over the last two years, there have been significant investments by Green Isle Foods and Dawn Farm Foods Ltd, supported by Enterprise Ireland, leading to significant employment increases in both of these facilities.  The agency has also supported the development of three Community Enterprise Centres in Clane, Allenwood and Athy.  The objective is to enhance the development of an enterprise climate through the provision of infrastructural facilities to support the establishment and expansion of micro enterprises through local community participation.  The availability of third level education facilities is a major advantage for the County.  Under its campus innovation programme Enterprise Ireland has approved €2.5m towards the cost of an Incubation Centre on the Maynooth Campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1899">Through its range of overseas offices, IDA Ireland is marketing County Kildare across a wide range of sectors such as International Services, Software, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals.  In addition, the agency works with its existing client base to expand and grow their activities.  The agency is also working with the Industrial Training agency FÁS to provide guidance in developing the skill set needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.  At present there are 25 IDA Ireland supported companies in the County employing over 10,350 people.  The agency's strategy is to promote the County as part of an integrated East Region with access to a population base of 1.5 million people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">The CEB is supporting individuals, firms and community groups where projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support such as advice, mentoring and training programmes, the CEB is central in assisting micro-enterprises to develop their growth potential.  I am satisfied that the policies and initiatives being pursued will continue to attract jobs and investment to County Kildare.</p>

            <p eId="para_1906">Taxation strategies in general reflect the political choices made by Governments towards meeting the specific needs and requirements of countries.  In this regard, Ireland has focused on achieving a low taxation economy, especially in the area of direct taxation, both income and corporation taxes, which has delivered significant advantages in terms of Ireland's competitiveness.  In ensuring a relatively low level of direct taxation on income, we have therefore had marginally higher indirect taxation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1907">Recent developments have seen some widening of the differential arising from indirect taxation as a result of a reduction in the UK VAT rate.  However, the UK Government has signalled that this reduction is a temporary measure to be reversed at the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1908">The Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy, to which the Deputy refers, sets out a strong rationale for beneficial all-island economic activity.  The study, which was published in 2006, highlights the "market widening effect" of a larger market on the island of Ireland, within which previously unexplored business opportunities can be exploited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">InterTradeIreland, the all-island trade and business development body which is jointly sponsored by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, has a central role to play in helping businesses North and South to tap into the all-island marketplace.  I understand that a significant number of North/South initiatives, which were envisaged in the Comprehensive Study, have been implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_1916">The Comptroller and Auditor General and Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (special Provisions) Bill 1998 was enacted on 16 December 1998.

            <p eId="para_1917">The Revenue Commissioners conducted on-site, DIRT look-back audits on 37 financial institutions during 1999 and 2000.  The focus of these audits was the DIRT position of the financial institutions concerned.  In the course of this audit programme, many bogus non-resident deposit accounts that belonged to taxpayers were identified.  A total of €225 million was collected from 26 of these financial institutions as a consequence of these audits.  The amount collected includes DIRT and the related interest and penalties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">The Revenue Commissioners issued Statement of Practice SP-Gen 1/01 in May 2001, which set out a voluntary disclosure incentive scheme for taxpayers who held bogus non-resident deposit accounts and who wished to disclose and pay all their outstanding tax liabilities by 15 November 2001. This approach to the bogus non-resident account problem was very extensively publicised at the time.  Many taxpayers took the opportunity that was offered and payments of €227 million were made under the disclosure scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">Enquiry work commenced on 16 November 2001 to identify taxpayers who choose not to avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme.

            <p eId="para_2032">All the bodies listed above and the Office of the Ombudsman have confirmed to me that they require flights to be approved at senior level prior to travel being undertaken and operate monitoring procedures to ensure proper adherence to the guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2033">The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has informed me that it is in compliance with the guidelines issued by my Department and that appropriate monitoring procedures are in place to ensure adherence to the guidelines.</p>

This is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to protect the whole financial system, secure its stability and ensure that all deposits in all Irish financial institutions are safe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions continues to be appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  While this recent action taken by the Government represents very significant progress in relation to savings protection for all credit unions, it is complementary to the continuing discussions between the Registrar of Credit Unions and the representative bodies for credit unions.  There is a shared recognition between all stakeholders that the Credit Union Act 1997 needs to be updated and modernised to take account of the evolution of the regulatory and financial environment overall.  In this context, it is important that the Registrar of Credit Unions and various representative bodies for credit unions continue to work together to forge a consensus on the appropriate model for credit unions for the future.  The expert advisory group on credit union matters under the Credit Union Act 1997, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) and my Department will, of course, continue to work with all the key stakeholders to support the achievement of this objective.</p>

            <p eId="para_2130">The NTMA has advised me that its annual net funding requirement is determined by the level of the Exchequer Balance and the amount of maturities of existing loans.  There were no major maturities in 2008, however the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement increased reflecting the shortfall in tax receipts in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2131">NTMA net borrowing in 2008 was mainly by way of two major new benchmark bonds: a 10 year bond in April raised €7 billion, and a 3 year bond in November raised €4 billion.  The 10 year bond was issued at a yield of 4.5%.  The 3 year bond was issued at a yield of 4.02%.  The ECB policy rates (main re-financing operations, fixed rate) on the relevant days in April and November were 4% and 3.25% respectively.  However, the bond yields and the ECB policy rates are not directly comparable; the ECB rate is an overnight rate, while the bond yields take into account their longer maturities.  The remainder of the NTMA's net borrowing this year will be carried out on the short-term commercial paper markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2132">Based on Budget 2009 projections, the NTMA has advised the market of its funding plans for 2009 which includes a €5 billion bond repayment in April 2009.  As such a gross debt issuance requirement of €18.4 billion next year is currently being planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">The funding requirement in respect of 2009 will be met by a combination of new syndicated benchmark bond issues and auctions. The NTMA's objective is to further develop a continuous and liquid yield curve for Irish Government bonds.

            <p eId="para_2135">Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that tax relief at the standard rate of tax (20%) is available in respect of tuition fees paid by an individual in respect of Third Level Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2136">A criterion for eligibility for the tax relief is that, for a year of assessment, an individual pays qualifying fees. Qualifying fees means tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college.  The maximum limit on such qualifying fees for the academic years 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 is €5,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">To qualify for the tax relief, the undergraduate courses must be of at least 2 academic years' duration. Some of those courses already approved include certain full-time and part-time courses in publicly funded third level institutions in the State (including institutions providing courses to which the Higher Education Grants Scheme applies) and in private colleges.  Undergraduate courses in private colleges must be formally approved by the Minister for Education and Science for the purposes of the tax relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">As regards colleges in the State, only courses undertaken in an approved college as defined in section 473A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are eligible for tax relief.  Section 473A defines an approved college in the State as being:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2139">(a)  a college or institution of higher education in the State which—</p>

            <p eId="para_2143">The College and the course referred to in the details supplied are not currently on the list of approved colleges and courses and, therefore, fees paid for courses undertaken at that College do not qualify for tax relief under Section 473A.

            <p eId="para_2144">Lists of approved colleges and courses are compiled by the Department of Education and Science on an annual basis (in August in advance of the new academic year) and forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners who post them to their website.</p>

Section 29 of the Act deals with vesting of property in the Minister and Section 30 deals with the process whereby the Minister may secure definitive ownership of property.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner.  He holds them in trust.  The State has no title documents and no knowledge of charges or encumbrances attaching to them.

            <p eId="para_2151">The position is that an exemption from income tax in respect of statutory redundancy is provided for in section 203 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and this exemption will also apply in relation to the income levy. In addition, section 201 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, provides for a basic exemption on a redundancy package of €10,160 plus €765 for each complete year of service in the office or employment. There is also provision for a further increased exemption of €10,000 in circumstances where the employee is not a member of a pension scheme, or has given up his or her right to entitlement to a lump sum from the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">The income levy will only be applied to that portion of any ex-gratia payment made by an employer on the termination of an office or employment which is in excess of these exemptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">The income levy will be deducted at the rate applicable on the date of payment. The rate of income levy, operated on a weekly or monthly basis by an employer, is governed by the thresholds of 1% on the first €100,100, 2% on the next €150,020 and 3% thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2154">Where an individual has an income levy charge in respect of a termination payment and this is deducted at a rate higher than that appropriate to his or her aggregate income for the year of assessment, any excess will be refunded when the full details of his or her circumstances are known at the end of the year of assessment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2158">As the Deputy is aware, in Budget 2009 I announced that an air travel tax will come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. A general rate of €10 per passenger will apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">The Finance Bill confirms the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009, however, I have taken account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  Consequently, the lower rate of €2 will apply to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the €2 rate. The airlines will be the liable persons for the tax, including paying it to Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. A number of countries within the EU apply similar taxes including, the UK, France and the Netherlands, as do Australia and New Zealand. The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.  While aviation policy is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport, the introduction of the air travel tax should have little, if any, impact on aviation policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2163">Section 5(1)(e) of the Ombudsman Act 1980 provides that "the Ombudsman shall not investigate any action taken . . . in the administration of the law relating to aliens or naturalisation".  These actions will continue to be excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 on the advice of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who considers that their inclusion would have serious implications for Government strategies in this field.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 sets out a legislative framework for the management of inward migration to Ireland and represents a comprehensive overhaul of the State's immigration and protection laws dating back to the Aliens Act 1935. When enacted, it will provide a legislative framework underpinning an enhanced immigration system offering greater clarity and certainty to migrants while at the same time guarding against abuses. The Bill also places the existing visa review process on a statutory basis and introduces a similar statutory review process in relation to decisions to refuse to renew such permission. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform considers that to add a further layer of review by extending the role of the Ombudsman would have a detrimental effect on current workloads in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and would affect processing times for applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">While the Ombudsman does not have the power to investigate immigration and naturalisation matters, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service receives correspondence from her Office on such cases and responds to such correspondence giving the factual position on the matter complained about.  The Ombudsman's Office, however, has no powers of investigation into the complaints made, in accordance with Section 5 (1) (e) of the Ombudsman Act 1980.</p>

            <p eId="para_2190">A report on the review of the operation of the Mental Health Act 2001 was laid before the Oireachtas in May 2007 in accordance with the provisions of Section 75 of the Act.  The report recommended a small number of amendments to the Act and also recommended that given that the full provisions of the Act had only been in operation since the 1st November 2006, a more detailed review be undertaken within 5 years of full implementation i.e. before 1 Nov 2011.  In addition, in July 2008, the Mental Health Commission submitted a report on the operation of Part 2 of the Act which made some recommendations for legislative change.  Work has commenced on drafting amendments to the Act and it is hoped that Heads of a Bill will be finalised in the New Year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2193">EU member states are the main purchasers of medicines in their domestic markets.  They naturally seek to control drug prices, but the extent of this control varies widely.  Some countries, such as the UK and Germany, rely more on market forces to set prices.  Spain and Portugal, on the other hand, closely regulate and control prices.  Ireland's pricing policy is somewhere in the middle of the European league as, with its relatively small market, it must seek to balance value for money in State drug spending with reliability and continuity of supply for essential products.</p>
            <p eId="para_2194">Price comparison in different markets is difficult.  Patent protection in Ireland  allows originator companies exclusive rights to the market for ten years for new medicines.  In Spain, for example, until 1992 there was no intellectual property protection for medicines and no patent protection for new products.  This kept prices down, but may change with patent and intellectual property exclusivity.  In addition, some products that are prescription-only in Ireland are available without prescription in some other states.</p>
            <p eId="para_2195">My Department and the Health Service Executive concluded negotiations in 2006 with pharmaceutical manufacturers on important new agreements setting out the pricing and supply of medicines for the Irish health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2196">These agreements provide increased value for money for the State and the consumer through a reduction in the price of existing drugs and medicines coming off patent and through the use of a new mechanism for pricing new drugs.  Over the period of the agreements, which run to 2010, it is expected to achieve savings of the order of €260 million across the GMS and community drugs schemes, and in the cost of drugs to hospitals, through off-patent price cuts of 35% for drugs with substitutable alternatives.  In addition to the savings quantified, there will be further savings as generic manufacturers respond to the lower price of branded drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2197">There will also be savings through the new pricing mechanism for new medicines, along with two price reviews for new medicines over the term of the agreements.  Finally, for the first time, reimbursement of new drugs in Ireland can now be informed by pharmacoeconomic assessment, in line with other EU countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2198">I must stress that no single measure will contain the rate of increase in expenditure on medicines and drugs.  Indeed, international experience has shown that this is a very difficult task, as the sophistication and range of treatments continue to increase along with increased expectations on the part of patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_2202">The O.E.C.D. Public Management Review: IRELAND — Towards an Integrated Public Service (2008) in its case study: Reconfiguration of the Health Services notes—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2203">"One statistical characteristic of Ireland is its very large number of practising nurses (15.2 per 1,000), which is twice the OECD average, just below Norway (15.4) but much higher than UK (9.1) or France (7.7).  The number of nurses graduating every year is also high (14.4), above Norway (10.1), UK (8.6) or France (5.9).  This contradicts the universal perception of a "shortage" of nurses, held by health actors in Ireland who were interviewed by the OECD.  Partial explanations come from the fact that some 40% of nurses in Ireland work part-time (as compared for example with 26% in France for nurses working in hospitals)."</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">The Deputy will be aware that in arriving at the 2009 Estimates, all Departments were required to deliver economy savings as part of Budget 2008. I announced that the HSE is to deliver economy savings of €115 million in this context. Among other matters this includes a reduction in nurse training expenditure in 2009. The total cost of nurse education to the health services, both undergraduate and post-registration, is currently in excess of €117 million per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">The number of places on the undergraduate nursing degree programmes will be reduced by 310 places from next year. This reduction was finalised following consultation between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, and I have no plans to alter this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">From next year we will be providing 1,570 undergraduate places in the following courses:</p>

            <p eId="para_2223">Further savings of €1.35m in 2009 will be achieved by reducing places on the various post-registration courses in specialist clinical practice.  These three cost saving measures will produce savings of €5m in 2009 and €8.45m in future years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2231">The Exchequer provides almost €8 billion in funding through the HSE Vote in respect of pay and pensions.  The HSE employs some 72,800 staff and funds agencies employing a further 38,000 staff.  In line with best practice in the commercial world and other sectors, the effective management of this resource would be greatly facilitated by comprehensive HR systems. Currently the HSE has a number of systems, including PPARS, which it uses to administer HR information and payroll in respect of employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2232">The best use of scarce taxpayers' resources for clinical care will only be achieved if payroll and administration costs are managed tightly — and in the modern age, this requires high quality IT systems and, therefore, necessary investment in those systems.  The Department is aware that the HSE is considering how best to enhance its HR systems solutions in order to meet its future requirements and expects in due course to receive the HSE's proposals. However, currently no such proposal has been developed by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">Any proposal which may be submitted by the HSE with regard to its HR systems requirements will, prior to any approval, be given very careful consideration by the Departments of Health and Children and Finance (CMOD) having regard to the need to ensure value for money and other demands on limited ICT capital funds.  The consideration will be informed by the experience of delivering large ICT projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_2237">I have recently received correspondence from the organisation mentioned by the Deputy. I understand that this correspondence was also to be forwarded to the Health Service Executive.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_2238">The Government remains of the view that the costs of pharmacy services under the GMS and community drugs schemes are not sustainable, a view that is reinforced by the current budgetary challenges.  It is clear that there are significant savings capable of being made for taxpayers, presently and in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2239">Expenditure on the medical card, drug payment and other demand-led schemes is approximately €2.6 billion and represents 18% of HSE current expenditure.  The average annual increase in expenditure in recent years has been 13%.  This rate of increase cannot be sustained.</p>
            <p eId="para_2240">It has been decided to introduce a range of further measures in 2009 to slow the rate of increase in these schemes and generate savings of €175m. These measures include an increase in the threshold for the Drug Payment Scheme from €90 to €100 a month; new guidelines for GPs on the prescribing of nutritional supplements; and other measures to reduce drug costs. It is therefore not a question of withdrawing nutritional supplements but rather an issue of appropriate prescribing and reducing wastage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2241">The HSE is developing an information pack for GPs which will include assessment tools and prescribing protocols for a defined group of oral nutritional products (sip feeds) restricted to defined categories of patient, time bound prescriptions (maximum two weeks) and needs monitored every three to six months. By reducing wastage and inappropriate prescribing this measure is expected to result in savings of approximately €7 million per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2242">The HSE is also undertaking competitive tendering arrangements to determine cost effective reimbursement prices for agreed non-drug items where appropriate. The estimated annual savings are approximately €3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2243">A review of demand led schemes is currently being carried out by the HSE with a view to commencing the implementation of targeted improvements at the earliest possible time while taking account of budgetary challenges in the short, medium and long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">In addition, I established a process under the Chairmanship of Dr. Michael Barry, to develop recommendations for good practice which will secure safe and effective prescribing for patients while maximising the potential for economy in the use of public funds.

            <p eId="para_2250">Regulation (EC) 1408/71 coordinates health and social security arrangements among EU member states (it also applies in the remaining EEA member states and Switzerland). Under these provisions, persons who are insured with (covered by) the healthcare system of one EU member state are entitled to receive healthcare in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured.  Such persons may include</p>
            <p eId="para_2251">people who are employed in one member state and resident in another and their dependants,</p>

            <p eId="para_2255">Ireland has waiver agreements with a number of member states (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Sweden, and until 2007 Netherlands) which comprehends temporary visitors between the two countries and accordingly charges do not normally arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2256">Ireland operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement with the United Kingdom comprehending such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries; pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country; and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The payment made in any one year is determined based upon an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.  The net payment received from the UK over the last four years is as follows: 2005 — €448.6 million, 2006 — €396.7 million; 2007 — €450 million; 2008 — €100 million estimated.  These amounts represent the actual payments made in cash in these years and do not correspond to the full liability for that particular year.  As explained below, only a small portion of these payments relates to UK visitors to Ireland and Irish visitors to the UK.  By far the largest part of the payment received from the UK authorities on an annual basis relates to the provision of healthcare to UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2257">The amount payable in any one year attributable to temporary visitors between Ireland and the UK is determined by the estimated number of visitor days and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The finalisation of accounts is normally some years in arrears to facilitate collation of relevant statistics and for the approval of the average cost prepared by each country for the year concerned at EU level.  The last accounts finalised were in respect of the year 2002 in respect of which Ireland's liability to the United Kingdom was calculated at Stg£6,487,402 (€9,455,000 approximately) for 21,084,000 visitor days (Ireland to UK) and the United Kingdom's liability to Ireland was €12,288,014 for 19,602,700 visitor days (UK to Ireland).  Accounts for subsequent years have not yet been finalised. However visitor days for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 have been estimated respectively as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_2312">The Deputy is referring to a recently published planning application to Dublin City Council in respect of the development of out-patient facilities at Beaumount Hospital for persons with cystic fibrosis. My Department has asked the Health Service Executive to advise the Deputy regarding the status of the application.  Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services for adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, €2.5m capital funding was provided to enable the hospital to provide out-patient facilities for patients with cystic fibrosis.  It is intended that the facility will be completed in late 2009.  Patients with cystic fibrosis will also benefit from additional single room capacity in the new Medical Assessment Unit at Beaumont Hospital,  which is due for completion early in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2406">Medical cards are made available by the Health Service Executive to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner services.  In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants — income and relevant outgoings.  In assessing a medical card/GP visit card application, the HSE uses guidelines based on people's means which includes their income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work.  The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical or social need, which may impact on people's ability to meet the cost of GP services.  I have no role in the process of determination of eligibility to medical cards or GP visit cards for individual applicants.  If an applicant is not content with the outcome of an appeal by the HSE, the matter can be raised with the Office of the Ombudsman for adjudication.</p>

            <p eId="para_2424">The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced by my office in January 2008, under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006 — 2010.  Community-based child care services which, immediately prior to the introduction of the CCSS, were supported under the staffing grant scheme implemented under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, were invited to participate in the CCSS.  Services in this category can also avail of the transitional arrangements of the CCSS under which they are guaranteed minimum funding levels based on their Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme grant amount in 2007.  As a result, services received at least 95% of their previous funding level in 2008, they will receive at least 85% of that amount in 2009 and they will receive at least 75% of that amount in 2010.  Where a service qualifies for an increased funding level under the CCSS, the higher grant payment is made.  Given the high number of services now participating in the CCSS, the amount of CCSS funding which each service will qualify for in 2009 will not be determined until January 2009.  As a result, to avoid any disruption to services it has been decided to set their level of grant aid for the first quarter of 2009 at the amount for which they qualified in the final quarter of 2008.  Any necessary upward or downward adjustment to payments will be made in the second quarterly payment in April 2009.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2494">On the first point, the question of whether the land register should be reformed to record all interests in property, is essentially a matter of legislative policy. The issue has been the subject of consideration for some time by a number of interested parties and it is generally accepted that the registration of such rights would be in keeping with moves towards electronic conveyancing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">The proposal would require a repeal and/or considerable recasting of Section 72 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 which sets out in detail the burdens which can affect land, the title to which is registered in the Land Registry, without the registration of those burdens. I am of the view that such a step would require substantial planning and careful review because of the expense which it might cause to affected parties to quantify and register the rights in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2496">Secondly on the question of whether all property should be mapped using the best available technology, I understand that the Digital Mapping Project, currently underway in the Property Registration Authority, uses the latest technologies and the highest standards which were recommended by an international consortium of expert consultants in such systems engaged to advise on the project. The most up-to-date Ordnance Survey Ireland maps, from its Irish Transverse Mercator (ITM) projection, are now being used as a backdrop to the Land Registry maps and these are fully GPS compatible for surveying purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2497">I can inform the Deputy that the boundaries of all registered parcels in 15 counties are now available online at the Property Registration Authority's website at www.landdirect.ie and the remaining counties will be released thereon on an incremental basis between now and the completion of the project in 2010. The Digital Mapping system is considered to be a world leader and the system has received several national and international awards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">Finally, with regard to the question of whether this information should be fully transparent and publicly available, the Deputy will be aware that all information on the registers is made available publicly, by payment of the prescribed fee, at public counters, through the post, and by way of internet services to subscribers on www.landdirect.ie.  In addition, map related information is available free of charge.</p>

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 17 February 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 22 December 2004, one of my predecessors refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 7 April 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">The person concerned initially presented as required and was given further presentation dates which she kept.  She subsequently failed to present as required on 13 October 2005 and was classified as evading her deportation. Should she come to the notice of the Gardaí, she would be liable to arrest and detention. She should, therefore, present herself to the GNIB without any further delay.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is, and remains, an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

            <p eId="para_2538">I am advised by the Garda authorities that local Garda Management is satisfied that the level of policing in Dunshaughlin is adequate to meet the service demands placed upon it.  The station forms part of the Ashbourne Garda District and is open to the public between the hours of 10am to 1pm every day. Patrols of the area are conducted on a 24/7 basis, with additional patrols / assistance being provided from other resources within the Garda District, i.e. the District Detective and Divisional Drugs Units, Community Policing and Garda Mountain Bike Units. The Divisional Traffic Corps is also based at Dunshaughlin Garda Station.</p>
            <p eId="para_2539">It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking into account all relevant factors such as population and crime trends etc.  The situation is kept under regular review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Meath Division and Drumshaughlin Garda Station will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2540">In accordance with the 2008 Garda Policing Plan, a new Meath Garda Division was established in June this year. This  brings about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of the Joint Policing Committees.  As part of this work, the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations of the new Division were also re-aligned and it is planned that a new Garda district of Laytown will be established on 1st of January next year.</p>

No prosecutions have been commenced or convictions recorded for this offence to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2580">Section 3 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 (as amended by Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008) created the offence of trafficking of children for the purpose of sexual exploitation. To date one person has been charged by the Garda Síochána on four counts of attempting to incite another to commit an offence contrary to Section 3 of this Act. The accused was charged in January 2007 and has already pleaded guilty to one count. The case is listed for sentence hearing at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 24th February, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2581">Prior to the enactment of Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, An Garda Síochána utilised the provisions of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, which remains in force. Since September 2000 over one hundred people have been arrested and detained in respect of alleged breaches of Section 2 of this Act. Five persons have been convicted in respect of twenty-five individual breaches of Section 2 Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, which relates to the facilitation/organisation of the illegal entry of persons into this State for gain.</p>

            <p eId="para_2584">Funding for human trafficking activities is paid for as part of the general expenditure from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Garda Votes and does not require specific earmarked expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">The drafting of the National Action Plan is at an advanced stage.  However a number of issues remain to be addressed with other Government Departments and Agencies before it can be finalised.

            <p eId="para_2590">I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that there has been considerable investment in training facilities over the past two years including the provision of two Modular Firearms ranges at the Garda College and in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  These prefabricated ranges are newly designed products that facilitate live fire shooting for up to four persons in a carefully contained environment which adheres to all range safety requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2591">In addition, a feasibility study into the measures required to bring the firearms range located at Garda Headquarters up to the highest international standard has been carried out. The upgrade of the Garda HQ range will be considered in the context of the overall Garda Accommodation Strategy that is being developed for An Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_2593">The persons concerned arrived in the State on 20 January, 2005 and sought asylum. Their applications for refugee status were refused in the first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Deportation orders were signed in respect of each applicant on 23 November, 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">Judicial review proceedings were instituted on 13 January, 2006 challenging the decision to make the deportation orders. The proceedings were determined on 30 January, 2008 when all reliefs sought were refused by the High Court. A certificate to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court was sought but this was refused by the High Court on 13 March, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2595">The applicants submitted applications for subsidiary protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 ("the Regulations") on 3 March, 2008. These applicants, as persons in respect of whom deportation orders were signed before the coming into force of the Regulations on 10 October, 2006, are not automatically entitled to apply for subsidiary protection. In such cases, I may exercise discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 to accept and consider an application for subsidiary protection where an individual has identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the deportation order was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2596">The persons in question were informed on 19 March, 2008 that my predecessor had decided to refuse to exercise his discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006, S.I. No. 518 of 2006 as no new or altered circumstances had been demonstrated.  Judicial review proceedings were instituted on 20 March, 2008 challenging this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2597">In a similar case, Gavryluk, the High Court has determined that I retain the discretion to accept and consider an application for subsidiary protection in situations where an applicant can demonstrate a change of circumstances from the time the deportation order was made. This is in line with the decision that was reached in respect of the applications made by these individuals The decision in Gavryluk is now under appeal, by the applicant, to the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_2598">On 18 November, 2008 the High Court refused an application on behalf of the applicants for an injunction restraining their deportation pending the hearing of the substantive application for judicial review of the decision to refuse to exercise discretion to consider the applications for subsidiary protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_2599">A case was lodged by the applicants' solicitor to the European Court of Human Rights on 11 September, 2008 under Article 34 seeking a declaration that the decision to deport the applicants represents a violation of their rights under Articles 3, 6, 13 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_2600">My Department was informed on 18 November, 2008 that the President of the Third Chamber of The European Court of Human Rights had indicated that as an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of the Court, the applicants should not be deported before midnight (Irish time) on 10 December, 2008, in order to give the Third Section of the Court the opportunity to consider the applicants' case at its meeting on 9 December 2008.  The European Court was informed on 19 November, 2008 that the persons concerned would not be deported while the Rule 39 interim measure remains in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2601">The facts of this case have been aired in court on numerous occasions over almost three years and on each occasion the courts have firmly endorsed the validity of the deportation orders made in respect of the applicants.   In his decision on 30 January 2008, Feeney J. noted that: "The applicants' applications for asylum were rejected on the basis that the Tribunal found that on the present evidence that there was no substantiation of the alleged risk to the applicant or of her children when considered objectively.  The history was not disbelieved but rather, on a forward looking test, it was deemed that it had not been demonstrated that there was a reasonable degree of likelihood of a well founded fear of persecution in the future."  The Court was also satisfied that an examination of additional evidence which the applicants sought to put forward did "not in fact materially alter the factual matrix" in the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2602">The substantive application for judicial review of the decision to refuse to exercise discretion to consider the applications for subsidiary protection is due to be heard by the High Court on 16 and 17 December, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">My Department was informed on 5 December, 2008 that the applicant has served a Notice of Appeal to the Supreme Court on the judgement of Hedigan J. issued on 18 November, 2008.  Accordingly, as the matter is now <i>sub judice</i>, I cannot comment further on the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_2607">A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form. That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.  Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave Ireland. He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.</p>

            <p eId="para_2609">The first and second named persons referred to by the Deputy are a wife and husband.  The third named person referred to is their adult son.</p>
            <p eId="para_2610">The first named person concerned applied for asylum on 7 August 2002 but later withdrew her application and applied for residency in the State on the basis of her parentage of an Irish citizen child. The first named person concerned was refused residency in the State on the basis of her parentage of an Irish citizen child and this decision was conveyed to the person concerned by letter dated 12 March 2004.  This communication also informed the first named person concerned that, arising from the refusal of her residency application and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the first named person concerned at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2611">The first named person concerned re-applied for asylum on 1 April 2004 and her application was refused following the investigation of her claims by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, the first named person concerned was informed, by letter dated 6 December 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the first named person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2612">The first named person concerned again applied for permission to remain in the State on the basis of her parentage of an Irish citizen child, born in the State before 1 January 2005, in accordance with the Revised Arrangements announced by my predecessor on 15 January 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme. Following the consideration of this application, a decision was taken to refuse the application and this decision was conveyed in writing to the first named person concerned by letter dated 12 January 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2613">The first named person concerned was later notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  No such application was submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2614">The case file of the first named person concerned, including all representations submitted, now falls to be considered in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). All representations submitted by and on behalf of the first named person concerned will be considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file of the first named person concerned is passed to me for decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2615">The third named person concerned arrived in the State on 14 April 2003 as an unaccompanied minor but was later reunited with his mother and included as a child dependant on his mother's asylum application.</p>
            <p eId="para_2616">The Deputy might wish to note that all decisions taken in respect of the first named person concerned applied equally to the third named person concerned.  However, given that the third named person concerned has recently become an adult, he was invited, by letter dated 28 November 2008, to submit representations, specific to his circumstances, that he would wish to have considered before the Minister makes a final decision in his case. While I understand that no such representations have yet been received, it is reasonable to assume that any such representations submitted by or on behalf of the third named person concerned will refer to any educational course he is pursuing. The Deputy can be assured that any such representations submitted will be fully considered before a final decision is taken in the case of the third named person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2617">The second named person concerned applied for asylum on 18 November 2002.  He withdrew this application on 10 February 2003 and applied for residency in the State on the basis of his parentage of an Irish citizen child. By letter dated 12 Mach 2004, the second named person concerned was informed that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. The second named person concerned re-applied for asylum on 1 April 2004 and, in light of this fact, the second named person concerned was notified by letter dated 22 April 2004 that his application for residency in the State could not be determined until such time as his asylum application had been finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_2618">The asylum application of the second named person concerned was refused following the investigation of his claims by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, the second named person concerned was informed, by letter dated 30 December 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.

Following the consideration of this application, a decision was taken to refuse the application and this decision was conveyed in writing to the second named person concerned by letter dated 12 January 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2620">Arising from the refusal of his application under the IBC/05 Scheme, the second named person concerned was notified, by letter dated 2 November 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.

            <p eId="para_2623">The applications which my Department receives are diverse in nature and the processing time frames vary considerably according to the nature and circumstances of the scheme in question.  In all instances, however, processing arrangements are kept under ongoing review and steps are taken to reduce waiting times where this is feasible having regard to available resources and overall priorities.  Significant changes are underway, for example, in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, which is developing a new Information Technology System which will considerably improve application times in this area. My Department has also reduced waiting times already in a number of other areas.  A comprehensive update of the various processing and waiting times is contained in following tabular statement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2750">I refer the Deputy to my Reply to Parliamentary Question No. 913 of 24th September 2008. The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2751">The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</p>

It is expected that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, when enacted, and administrative measures currently being implemented by my Department, in conjunction with Governmental and non-Governmental organisations will allow for ratification of this Protocol.  Ratification of the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime will be necessary before the second Protocol can be ratified. Many of the provisions of that Convention have already been given effect through legislation.  Some additional legislation is required before ratification of the Convention can take place.  Government approval to proceed with the drafting of the required legislation will be sought early in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2766">I am further informed that this type of criminality is regularly targeted by An Garda Síochána.  A number of joint and international initiatives have taken place, co-ordinated by members of the Organised Crime Unit attached to the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in conjunction with members from the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Money Laundering Section of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767">When incidents relating to the sex industry in general are reported to or uncovered by the Garda authorities as part of investigations into other criminality, those suspected of being involved in the organisation of, or participation in, this type of criminal activity are the subjects of thorough investigation and, where sufficient evidence is adduced, investigation files are submitted to the Law Officers for directions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2768">The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 is fully operational since 7 June, 2008.  The Act creates offences of trafficking in children and adults for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs.  It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2769">The Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of my Department, in conjunction with the interdisciplinary National Referral Mechanism Working Group on Trafficking in Human Beings, is developing a data collection strategy which aims at collating data from a variety of organisations on trafficking in human beings.  This information will be used to assess the true extent of the problem, direct policy and plan the allocation of resources.  The extent of the problem of human trafficking should become more apparent as An Garda Síochána enforce the Act and as more people recognize the indicators of trafficking.</p>

            <p eId="para_2776">As the Deputy will be aware, the United States Deputy Secretary of State, John Negroponte, and I signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a new Working Holiday Programme between our two countries in Washington on 24 September.  Since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment, has moved quickly to finalise arrangements for US citizens interested in working and travelling in Ireland. A comprehensive step by step guide and application form for US applicants has been prepared and distributed to our Missions in the United States. We are ready to begin accepting applications from US citizens, and will do so as soon as the US State Department has finalised its arrangements for Irish citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">At a meeting in Dublin on 17 November, I emphasised to Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte the need to ensure that the Programme is fully operational at the earliest possible date. The State Department has assured the Government that it is actively working to finalise its arrangements and will shortly complete this process.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2789">The Government remain seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which has effectively been isolated since the Hamas takeover in June 2007, even during a ceasefire between Israeli forces and Hamas which was broadly respected from 19 June 2008 until 4 November 2008. The Government have consistently called for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza, in particular through the re-opening of crossing points for the movement of people and goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">Since June 2007, Israel has maintained the closure of all border crossings for the movement of people, with limited exceptions. Rafah International Crossing Point, the only border crossing via a country other than Israel, also remains closed since June 2007, with only very limited openings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">Since 4 November, Israel has also effectively closed all border crossings for commercial goods, and even for humanitarian supplies. While there have been some limited openings for humanitarian supplies since 17 November, the volume of supplies remains greatly reduced and insufficient to meet the needs of the local population.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">The Government agree with those who state that the effective isolation of Gaza constitutes collective punishment and is illegal under international humanitarian law. The population of 1.5 million have been facing unsustainable conditions of daily life, which have been even more acute since 4 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_2793">Ireland will continue to work with EU partners to ensure that our concerns about these matters are conveyed to the Israeli Government at every appropriate opportunity. I was active in raising the humanitarian situation in Gaza at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels yesterday. The Conclusions adopted by the Council make clear that the humanitarian situation should be addressed with all urgency, that crossings should be opened for the supply of goods and services and that the ability of the UN Works and Relief Agency (UNWRA) to deliver humanitarian assistance should be assured.</p>
            <p eId="para_2794">Ireland also raised the situation in Gaza during the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 4 December, calling on Israel to respect its obligations under international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2795">While expressing our humanitarian concerns about Gaza, the Government unreservedly condemn the recent renewal of rocket attacks from Gaza on towns in southern Israel. Our clear message is for an immediate end to all violence. We support the efforts being made through Egyptian facilitation to re-establish the ceasefire in Gaza, and renew it beyond the envisaged expiry date of 18 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_2796">Finally, I support and commend efforts being made by Egypt, on behalf of the Arab League, to advance reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas. Success in these discussions is greatly in the interests of the Palestinian people, and can only help to underpin efforts to secure a lasting peace.</p>

            <p eId="para_2798">While visa policy is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I understand that all visitors to Ireland who require visas must hold individual visas. However, special arrangements have been put in place by the visa office in Moscow on the issuing of visas for Belarusian children who travel to Ireland each year. I am pleased to say that these arrangements are working well.</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">I am delighted to inform the Deputy that an Irish delegation travelled to Minsk yesterday and successfully concluded a bilateral Agreement between Ireland and Belarus on the conditions of recuperation of children from the Republic of Belarus in Ireland. The Belarusian authorities also agreed that children from Belarus can travel to Ireland over the Christmas period. I know that this news will come as a great relief to the many Irish families which welcome Chernobyl children to their homes every year and also to the NGOs which do such important work and whose role is recognised in the Agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2842">The National Aquatic Centre (NAC) is operated by NSCDA (Operations) Ltd., a subsidiary company of the National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA).  All day-to-day operations of the NAC are a matter for the Authority and the operations company.  Following the restoration of the NAC to the then Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Ltd., on 1 December 2006, an extensive capital programme was undertaken to restore the Centre to its original condition. Much effort has gone into rebuilding its reputation and increasing its customer base and, in that context, an initial subsidy of €1.8 million was required in its first full year of operation. In 2008 a more positive picture of operational needs has emerged and I am encouraged by the significant increase in both visitor numbers and income which is being achieved to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2843">In parallel, the Authority arranged for a financial assessment study, which is benchmarking the NAC against other equivalent facilities, to be carried out. This work is now completed and it is being evaluated by the Authority. This exercise, together with the Centre's performance since it reverted to the direct control of the Authority, will inform my decisions on the funding requirements of the Centre both in the short and longer terms.</p>

            <p eId="para_2892">I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 323 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2893">The Pensions Act provides for a minimum Funding Standard which defined benefit pension schemes must meet on an ongoing basis. Generally speaking, the Standard requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them to discharge accrued liabilities in the event of a scheme winding up. Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years. The Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2894">In 2007, 81% of defined benefit schemes reporting to the Pensions Board passed the Funding Standard. Most of those schemes failing the test had a funding proposal in place. It is expected that the number of schemes failing the funding standard will increase significantly in the coming year. However, the extent of the problem will not be fully apparent until schemes carry out end of year actuarial assessments and report the results to the Pensions Board as required under the Pensions Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2895">In recognition of the current market difficulties and the difficult decisions that pension schemes will face, the Government has put in place a number of short-term measures to ease the pressure on schemes. It has been agreed with the Pensions Board that an additional six months will be allowed for trustees to prepare funding proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2896">This will mean that schemes will have 18 months to review the situation with sponsoring employers and to formulate proposals for recovery. These actions are being taken to alleviate the current situation.    Members of Defined Contribution schemes have also been exposed to investment losses. In such schemes the risk is borne in full by the member. Many of these schemes are relatively immature and for many people there will be adequate time to recoup some or all of the losses which have occurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">There are particular concerns for those who may be at, or close to, retirement. Good practice would suggest a conservative approach to investments in the last number of years before retirement but anecdotal evidence suggests this may not have been applied in some cases. Members of defined contribution schemes are required to purchase an annuity at the point of retirement. In the current environment, these scheme members could realise a significant loss in the value of their pension fund. In the circumstances, the Minister Finance recently announced a concession in this area which will allow scheme members a period of up to two years to purchase an annuity. There is, of course, the risk that those availing of the deferment option could sustain further losses and this will be clearly outlined in guidance notes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">The Government is working with the Pensions Board, representative organisations and the social partners to find ways to ease the pressure on schemes by striking a balance between the long-term nature of pension savings and the need to ensure short-term security of accrued benefits. As outlined, it has already taken some short-term measures in this area. The long-term response to the situation is being considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions and any changes proposed will be announced in the context of the overall framework for pensions which the Government has indicated it will announce in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2969">Employments that are insurable at PRSI Class D are classified as modified employments.  PRSI Class D provides social insurance coverage for permanent and pensionable employees in the public service — other than those who were recruited after 6 April, 1995, or doctors and dentists employed in the Civil Service, Gardaí, commissioned army officers, and members of the Army Nursing Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2970">Contributors insured at PRSI Class D are not eligible for social insurance-based pensions on retirement. Modified employments are covered under Civil Service regulations for both sick pay during illness, and their occupational pensions are covered by a superannuation scheme.  As such, social insurance protection for these payments is not provided for.</p>
            <p eId="para_2971">Under Schedule 1, Part 3, Section 5 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 modified contributors are defined as excepted self-employed contributors. This means that a modified contributor is prohibited from simultaneously paying PRSI Class S contributions on other earnings from other sources.  There are no plans to review or alter the arrangements outlined above.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2977">I propose to take Questions Nos. 329 to 333, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2978">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent companies with voluntary boards of management and over 240 money advice staff operating the local services throughout the country.  Last year, MABS provided services to 12,400 new clients throughout the country.  To the end of November 2008 approximately 15,600 new clients have approached the service. Information on the number of new clients dealt with in each MABS company in 2007 and up to the end of September 2008, the latest breakdown available per MABS company, is detailed in the following table.</p>
            <p eId="para_2979">All MABS Companies operate an appointment system for meeting clients.  Information is not available on the MABSIS on the waiting times for appointments at different offices.  However, in all cases, clients with urgent difficulties are dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the MABS National Telephone Helpline, 1890 382438 available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and to the MABS website www.mabs.ie available 24 hours for immediate assistance with budgeting and money management issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2980">The MABS National Telephone Helpline was launched in October 2007 and has dealt with almost 11,500 calls to date.  Over 90% of callers to the Helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline advisor.  Some 10% of callers are referred for appointment to the local MABS services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2981">MABS National Helpline uses an Eircom LoCall 1890 number to ensure that callers can ring from anywhere in Ireland at local call rate.  Callers using landlines incur a charge of 1.32 cent per minute after 6pm and 5.17 cent per minute during office hours.  Callers ringing from mobile phones incur higher charges, but in such cases it is the practice for the helpline advisor to offer to ring the caller back.  The use of 1890 numbers for the MABS Helpline is in line with the practice of other national helplines such as the Financial Regulator, Citizens Information and the Food Safety Authority.  The objective is to ensure that there is a low cost accessible service for clients throughout the country while at the same time ensuring value for money for the taxpayer who funds the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2982">The MABS provides a high quality personal service to the public and makes a difference to peoples lives.  However, it has been recognised for some time that the Service needs a proper legislative basis and structure.  The Programme for Government envisaged that such a new structure for the MABS would involve strong national leadership and would maximise the current local voluntary involvement in the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2983">The Government has decided that this can best be achieved by placing the MABS with the Citizens Information Board.  The MABS and Citizens Information Centres complement each other well as both are involved in providing information, advice and advocacy services to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2984">In addition, the Citizens Information Board has a long association with the MABS at both national and local level and was involved in establishing some of the original MABS pilot projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2985">The legislative provisions to give effect to the proposed changes are contained in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  It is proposed that the legislative provisions will be brought into effect by way of a Commencement Order and that a six months period up to July 2009 will be required to complete the administrative arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for the MABS to the Citizens Information Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_3144">The person concerned was refused rent supplement on the grounds that he had voluntarily surrendered local authority accommodation already available to him in Scotland.  The HSE's Appeals Office has advised that it recently upheld the decision of a superintendent community welfare officer to refuse payment of rent supplement to the person concerned.  However, that office has further advised that it is now reviewing this decision in the light of additional documentary evidence supplied by the person concerned.  He will be advised him shortly of the outcome of this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3146">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_3147">Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.  Rent levels declined by almost 5% by August of this year and continue to decline.  The supply of available rental accommodation is also reported to have more than doubled in the last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3148">Notwithstanding the current rent limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed rent limits as an exceptional measure where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances for example disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons.  This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_3149">In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods.  There are currently over 72,200 people in receipt of rent supplement.  Over 32,000 are getting a supplement for 18 months or more.  For this reason, the rent supplement scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_3150">One of the measures introduced to address long-term housing needs is the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).  RAS gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis.  Since 2005, over 15,800 rent supplement recipients have been transferred to RAS units and other social housing options.</p>
            <p eId="para_3151">With regard to the position of a single person, if they have been in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more they should register with their local authority for RAS.</p>

            <p eId="para_3166">Under Social Welfare legislation, decisions in relation to all aspects of claims are made by statutorily appointed Deciding Officers.  Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  Decisions in relation to Supplementary Welfare Allowance (including Rent Supplement) are made by Community Welfare Officers in the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_3167">The question of what is a person's "habitual residence" has been decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.  The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, or immigration status.  The criteria have been incorporated in social welfare legislation (Section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007) to guide a deciding officer in determination of the habitual residence condition and include an assessment of the claimant's main centre of interest and future intentions as it appears from all the circumstances.  The criteria have been drawn from judgments of the European Court of Justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_3168">Irish nationals returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in meeting the requirements of the Habitual Residence Condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3169">The Habitual Residence Condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.</p>

Those taking up self-employment must first have their self-employment project approved.  In partnership areas this will be done by the partnership company.  In non-partnership areas this will be done by the department's local facilitator.

            <p eId="para_3188">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the home-maker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3189">There is also a number of other ways in which pension entitlements can be protected. People who qualify for payments such as carer's allowance or carer's benefit may, subject to conditions, qualify for credited contributions for the period during which they receive the payment. In addition, over the last 10 years the Government has taken a number of measures to make qualification for contributory pension easier and to provide direct payments to more people. These include a reduction in the yearly contribution rate required for a minimum pension from 20 to 10, and the introduction of special measures such as the pre-53 pension. Also, in the case of pensions awarded from September 2006 qualified adult payments are being made direct to the spouse or partner. These measures are of particular benefit to people with less than complete social insurance records and ensure that more people receive a direct pension payment. Other measures are discussed in the Green Paper on Pensions and decisions in relation to them will be made in the context of the framework for future pension policy, which the Government has indicated it will announce in the near future.</p>

Every effort is being made to process claims in local offices as quickly as possible. This includes the prioritisation of work, assignment of additional resources including staffing and overtime. Because of the increased number of claims for jobseeker payments, the Department undertook a review of staffing levels in Local Offices in May and June of this year. This resulted in the assignment of an additional 31 staff to some 15 Local Offices.  Following on the most recent review of the staffing levels in Local Offices, an additional 115 staff are to be assigned.

            <p eId="para_3264">The development of a National Carers' Strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement Towards 2016 and the Programme for Government. A working group, chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, is working on developing the strategy. My Department provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as FÁS and the Health Service Executive. Developing the strategy involves consultation with other government departments and bodies not represented on the working group.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">The Department has met with a wide range of organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency, Citizen's Information Board, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the National Disability Authority to discuss this issue. A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers in early March. The closing date for submissions was Friday 18 April 2008. There was a good response from individuals and organisations and the submissions received are being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_3266">Towards 2016 commits the Department to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant departments and agencies. Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008. Representatives of 12 groups and 9 government departments and bodies attended. The theme was the National Carers' Strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy. I was very pleased to launch the report, Listening to Carers, Report on a Nationwide Carer Consultation, produced by the Carers Association in partnership with Caring for Carers Ireland and Care Alliance on 30 June this year. The issues raised in this report are currently being considered as part of the development of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3267">The commitment to the development of a National Carers Strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners. An update in relation to the strategy was provided to the social partners plenary session in February. The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May 2008. Key issues raised were recognition for carers and their work, access to suitable health services, income support, training, gender issues and balancing employment and care. The interdepartmental group is currently working on bringing the carers strategy to completion.</p>

The person concerned was refused supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplement on the grounds that he is not habitually resident in the State. The designated Appeals Office of the Health Service Executive has advised that it has received an appeal from the person concerned. The appeal will be processed as quickly as possible once all appropriate information is available to that office, including additional information requested from the community welfare officer. The Executive has advised that, as an exceptional measure, a payment issued to the person concerned on 3 December 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3344">My Department's Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, which is administered by local authorities, provides targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people. The types of works which may be grant aided under the Scheme are varied and may include the provision and upgrading of insulation works. In addition, older people living in local authority housing may benefit from the central heating programme introduced by my Department in July 2004. The programme assists local authorities in providing central heating facilities in their rented dwellings and, where necessary, in implementing measures to ensure the energy efficiency of the dwelling. As announced in the context of Budget 2009, an audit of the social housing stock will commence in 2009, in preparation for a programme of retrofitting to deliver improved energy efficiency standards; this programme will be informed by a number of pilot projects for which €5m has been earmarked in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the auspices of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, operates a Low Income Housing Programme, set up to help establish and implement a national plan of action to address the problem of fuel poverty. Core delivery is through the Warmer Homes Scheme, which aims at improving the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by low-income households, and at establishing the systems and growing the capacity in Ireland to install measures including attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting, and cavity wall insulation, and to provide energy advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_3346">Furthermore, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources launched a pilot Home Energy Saving Scheme on 24 April 2008. The scheme is designed to encourage owners of older homes to improve the energy efficiency of their homes, including through improved insulation measures. The regional pilot is designed to inform the roll-out of the full scale €100 million national scheme envisaged in the Programme for Government.  The scheme will provide different incentives in each of the regional pilot areas in order to test their impact and effectiveness in encouraging householders to undertake energy efficiency investment works. The incentives will include varying levels of capital grants, advice on works required and information on banks offering reduced rate loans to scheme participants.</p>

In addition under Section 52(7) any person who wilfully allows or causes to escape any species of exotic wild animal, including snakes or transfers such wild animal to any place in the State for the purposes of establishing it in a wild state unless under licence would be guilty of an offence. I understand that my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service receives occasional reports of escaped snakes but is not aware of any population of snakes living in the wild in Ireland. I do not consider that there is sufficient evidence of a need, at this time for a total ban on the importation of snakes.</p>

            <p eId="para_3364">Despite the challenges that the current economic situation presents, meeting the relevant targets set out in the Government Programme, the social partnership agreement Towards 2016, and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 continues to be the overriding objective of the Social Housing Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3365">The commitment entered into under Towards 2016 was to achieve 27,000 social housing "starts" over the three year period 2007 to 2009.  In terms of delivery, we set out to reach the first one third of this 27,000 unit target — or 9,000 "starts" — in 2007 and we exceeded this target, with a total of 9,061 "starts" achieved across the local authority and voluntary and co-operative housing programmes and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  All the indications available to us at this stage would suggest that 2008 will be another year of significant delivery under the main social housing programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3366">Looking to the future, the results of the 2008 housing needs assessment show a significant increase in overall net housing need, against a background of a significantly more constrained fiscal environment.  While this presents a challenging scenario, the €1.66 billion in funding provided for housing in the 2009 Estimates will allow us to maintain strong momentum towards meeting our commitments in Towards 2016 and our longer-term goals under the National Development Plan.  In particular, progress will be underpinned by the continued roll-out of the Rental Accommodation Scheme and new initiatives including the sourcing of accommodation for social housing through long-term lease arrangements and the introduction of an incremental purchase scheme through which lower income households can access home ownership.</p>

            <p eId="para_3368">Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both and €250 for each day of a continuing offence.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">In the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016, the Government committed to updating these minimum standards and recently delivered on this commitment by approving a package of measures.  Those elements of the package not requiring primary legislation will be introduced through new regulations to replace those made in 1993.  Regulations for this purpose, which will shortly be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, will come into effect generally on 1 February 2009 and will include a provision covering sanitary facilities.  This provision will have the effect of removing bedsit accommodation from the rental market.  However, taking account of views expressed in wide-ranging consultations during the development of the new standards package, this element of the new regulations, together with the provisions covering heating facilities and food preparation, storage and laundry will not come into effect for existing rental accommodation until 1 February 2013 as it will be necessary to allow time for the carrying out of the significant remedial work that may be involved in achieving compliance.  Those aspects will therefore continue to be subject to the relevant provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Housing) Regulations 1993 until then, insofar as existing rental accommodation is concerned.  However, any rental properties being let for the first time after 1 February 2009 will have to comply with all the requirements of the new Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">A number of specific elements of the package will require primary legislation and will be addressed in the context of the passage through the Oireachtas of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  These include increased penalties for non-compliance and the introduction of a more robust sanctions regime.</p>

            <p eId="para_3449">The Government is fully committed to the EU position in the international negotiations on a global climate agreement, that developed countries should take the lead in action to address climate change by committing collectively to reducing their emissions in the order of 30% by 2020 compared to 1990.  In this context, the European Council has endorsed an EU objective of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 as its contribution to a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emissions reductions and that economically more advanced developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities.  In this context, the EU has called on all developed countries to propose, not later than mid-2009, economy-wide medium-term targets that involve a comparable level of effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_3450">Notwithstanding this international position, the European Council is committed to transforming Europe into a highly energy-efficient and low greenhouse-gas-emitting economy, and has decided, without prejudice to its position in international negotiations, to make a firm, independent commitment to achieve at least a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.  The adjustment to the higher target as part of an international climate agreement needs to be built explicitly into the climate legislative proposals.</p>

Furthermore, the Government is determined to fulfil its commitments that will be agreed as part of a future global and comprehensive climate agreement for the period beyond 2012 in Copenhagen in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3458">I propose to take Questions Nos. 372 to 375, inclusive, and 381 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3459">The decision to close the Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway is an operational matter for the board of Bord na Móna plc.  I do not propose to intervene in the matter.  However, as previously stated in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 550 from Deputy Charles Flanagan on November 11th last, I have obtained information from the company on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_3460">Bord na Móna advises that the company has operated the Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway (CWOR) since 1990.  It has operated from April to September each year and consisted of a guided rail coach tour around 10 kilometres of Bord na Móna's industrial rail line giving a history of the formation, use and after-use of the area's bog land.</p>
            <p eId="para_3461">The CWOR has been operated on a section of the Bord na Móna rail network, which serves the West Offaly Power Station at Blackwater Works.  This rail line is the transport mechanism for supplying the power station with milled peat for energy generation.  Because the power station is now operating to its full capacity, the level of supply-related rail traffic on this line has increased substantially in the last year and is set to continue at this level.  Bord na Móna advises that, for legal, health and safety reasons, a passenger service cannot now be operated on the same line as the industrial service operating at full capacity.  Therefore, Bord na Móna advises that there is regrettably, no option but to close the CWOR.</p>
            <p eId="para_3462">Three regular staff were employed seasonally on the CWOR for the duration of the tourism season with two casual staff engaged as needed to cater for peak demand.  The regular staff have been offered the opportunity to redeploy to other positions in Bord na Móna.</p>
            <p eId="para_3463">I am advised that Bord na Móna is already working closely with Fáilte Ireland on developing plans for eco-tourism related projects for cutaway bogs in the Mid-Shannon Region taking account also of the fact that Clonmacnoise is set to become a World Heritage Site.</p>

            <p eId="para_3465">Financial supports are available to homeowners under two schemes funded by my Department to improve the energy efficiency of existing houses.  For households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of fuel allowance, invalidity or disability benefit, the Warmer Homes Scheme managed by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) will install cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, a boiler lagging jacket, draught-proofing measures and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  These measures are provided free or at a token cost.  Funding of €10 million has been made available for this Scheme in 2009, which includes a contribution of €5 million from ESB and Bord Gáis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3466">Householders generally will be in a position to avail of grants for energy efficiency improvement measures under the Home Energy Saving Scheme from next year.  I launched the Scheme this year on a pilot basis, in a selected number of areas, and with a budget of €5 million.  The pilot Scheme is grant aiding cavity wall insulation, wall lining insulation, external insulation, attic insulation, heating controls and low emission double glazing.  This pilot phase is informing the design of the wider roll out of the scheme in 2009 for which provision of €20 million has been made.</p>

            <p eId="para_3468">Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) operates a number of grant schemes in this area, these include the Renewable Energy Research Development and Demonstration programme, which provides grant support for the development of new renewables energy technologies, including the development of advanced biomass energy systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_3469">In support of the commercial deployment of biomass heating systems, for the domestic user SEI operates the Greener Homes Scheme, which provides fixed grant support for biomass boilers.  At the commercial level, SEI operates  the Renewable Energy Heating scheme, which provides 30% grant support for  boilers up to 1 Mega Watt in size.  Boilers at a size larger than this also qualify for grant support with a slightly reduced rate.  Both programmes are designed to stimulate the deployment of renewable energy heating in Ireland and will assist the Government in achieving its target of delivering 12% of its heat from renewable energy sources by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_3470">Depending on the nature of the technology, individuals may apply to SEI for support for the development of renewable technology.   Other Departments and Agencies may also offer support for research and development programmes.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3475">The Government is fully committed to the EU position in the international negotiations on a global climate agreement.  The EU position is that developed countries should take the lead in action to address climate change by committing to collectively reducing their emissions in the order of 30% by 2020 compared to 1990.  In this context, the European Council has endorsed an EU objective of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990, as its contribution to a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emissions reduction and that economically more advanced developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities.  In this context, the EU has called on all developed countries to propose, not later than mid-2009, economy-wide medium-term targets that involve a comparable level of effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_3476">Notwithstanding this international position, the European Council is committed to transforming Europe into a highly energy-efficient and low greenhouse-gas-emitting economy, and has decided, without prejudice to its position in international negotiations, to make a firm, independent commitment to achieve at least a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.  The adjustment to the higher target as part of an international climate agreement needs to be built explicitly into the climate legislative proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_3495">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter, in the first instance, for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated where appropriate by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3496">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the now concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).  There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is nearing completion.  The NBS is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to provide services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3497">On the 25th of November 2008 I announced that 3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, had been selected as the preferred tenderer for the NBS following the conclusion of a comprehensive competitive procurement process.

All requests for a broadband service in the areas to be addressed by the NBS, including any unserved areas in County Tipperary, like Toomevara, will be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_3499">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter, in the first instance, for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated where appropriate by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3500">It is important to note that in addition to fixed landline broadband, otherwise known as digital subscriber line (DSL) or broadband over telephone lines, broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms including cable, satellite, fixed wireless and increasingly mobile.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated where appropriate by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.

            <p eId="para_3503">There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In this regard, my Department has undertaken to implement a National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The NBS is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to provide services.  It will bridge the digital divide, create greater equality in terms of social and economic inclusion and remove the disadvantage caused by a lack of broadband services.  It will also facilitate competition in the broadband market in the regions leading to greater choice, quality and value for money to the consumer.  On the 25th of November 2008 I announced that 3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, had been selected as the preferred tenderer for the NBS following the conclusion of a comprehensive competitive procurement process.  The NBS contract is expected to be signed with 3 by mid-December.</p>

            <p eId="para_3509">An application under the Single Payment Scheme /Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received in this case on the 15th May 2008.  This application was selected for a cross compliance and satellite eligibility inspection. The cross compliance inspection was carried out on 10th October 2008. This inspection raised issues in relation to bovine identification and registration. Under the system for tolerance for minor non-compliances the applicant was requested to resolve the issues. The issues were resolved by the applicant and no financial penalty applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3510">However, the satellite inspection raised a number of issues relating to the parcels claimed by the applicant. In accordance with normal procedure, inconclusive satellite results must be subject to a ground inspection.  This ground inspection was initiated on the 21st November 2008 but due to the onset of darkness the inspection had to be abandoned and reconvened on the 28th of November. At the reconvened inspection it was found that the applicant was non-compliant with the Nitrates Directive and the provisions of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions on parts of his holdings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3511">Initial notice of the findings of this inspection was given verbally to the applicant on the 28th of November.  At no point did the Inspecting Officer make reference to animal welfare issues. Written notification of the initial findings was issued to the applicant on the 5th of December. The initial findings indicate a possible 5% Cross Compliance Penalty for non-compliance with the requirements under the Nitrates Directive and the provisions of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions. A further penalty for over-declaration may also apply in relation to the parcels that were the subject of the ground inspection but the penalty (if any) cannot be determined until the area of ineligible features is calculated and recorded on the land parcel data base.</p>
            <p eId="para_3512">The applicant may, if he so wishes, forward his comments on the initial finding to the local office of my Department within 14 days.   A formal written decision will issue in any event at the end of this period and it will set out the penalty if any applied.  If the applicant is not satisfied with the decision, he may seek a review by contacting his Local Office. He also has the right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Agriculture Appeals Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_3514">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_3515">Most REPS plans are now prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  As the information in these plans is in computerised format, the administrative checks can be carried out quickly.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted this year were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that this process was delayed.  While normal working has resumed in the local offices following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, there is still much to be done before the administrative checks are completed.  In these circumstances my Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission were not prepared to allow this,  As a result, it is now apparent that REPS 4 payments cannot issue before the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3516">While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, and my Department will make every effort to facilitate this, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3 and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year. Staff in my Department's local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers, and I have asked them to make every effort to issue as many payments as possible before Christmas.  I have asked senior management in my Department to give me regular updates on the payment situation.</p>

         asked the

         the amount allocated and expended each year respectively for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 since its enactment in 2004 with a breakdown of expenditure each year; the amount allocated for the implementation in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_626">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3614">The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 provides a statutory framework for the education of children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3615">As the Deputy will be aware, a significant number of sections of the EPSEN Act have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.  However, in the present financial circumstances the full implementation of the EPSEN Act has been deferred to a date later than originally intended.  The Government will keep the matter under review and remains committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3616">Education provision is not solely constrained within the provisions of the EPSEN Act.  Services are provided on a non-statutory basis, and with regard also to other relevant legislation such as the Education Act, 1998, the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, the Equal Status Act, 2000-2004 and the Disability Act, 2005 under the overall umbrella of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3617">Therefore, although a number of provisions of the EPSEN Act remain to be formally commenced, appropriate education services are provided as a central element in the Government's commitment to supporting children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3618">This support is provided across a wide spectrum of initiatives within the education sector.  At school level, in addition to the teachers provided in the classroom, significant additional supports are also provided to enable schools to cater for the needs of students with special educational needs.  Such supports include resource teaching support, special needs assistant support, special transport arrangements, enhanced capitation and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3619">Expenditure on these services occurs across a range of subheads in the department; there is no separate provision dedicated to the implementation of the EPSEN Act.  Even when EPSEN is fully implemented it would not be practical to identify expenditure specifically triggered by the Act.  For example, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) will provide a range of services some of which may be provided as a result of the implementation of EPSEN with others being delivered on a non-statutory basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3620">When the overall annual spend in 2008 to support persons with special educational needs is considered, my Department will spend an estimated €900m in total by the end of this year.  The equivalent spends for 2004, 2005, 2006 and  2007 are €468m, €605m, €706m and €838m respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_3621">I am also pleased to confirm that in excess of €1 billion will be available next year to support children and adults with special educational needs.  I am particularly pleased that, in order to strengthen and enhance services, and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the EPSEN Act at a later date, the Government has provided €20m in 2009 — €10m for education services and €10m for health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3622">In my Department this additional funding will provide for an expansion of the  NEPS service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service as well as enhancing the capacity of the NCSE to co-ordinate the provision of services to children with special educational needs.  In addition teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs and there will be further investment in teacher training in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3623">An integrated approach is being adopted by the education and health sectors to target these additional resources to the areas of greatest need.  Progress in both sectors will be kept under review by the Office for Disability &amp; Mental Health and the Cross-Sectoral Team during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3624">With the levels of investment outlined, it is clear that significant progress has been made in educational provision for people with special educational needs in recent years.  This progress has been achieved through the additional investments made by successive Ministers for Education.  Advances in the level of dedicated provision to support children with special educational needs include:</p>
            <p eId="para_3625">Schools are now allocated extra resource teachers and special needs assistants to enable them meet the special educational needs of students.  In the region of 19,000 staff in our schools work solely with children with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3626">Special Needs Assistant posts have increased from under 300 in 1997 to almost 10,000 in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3627">Primary schools are staffed up-front with additional teachers to cater for the most prevalent special educational needs — removing the need for assessments and delays in recruitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3628">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was established under the  EPSEN Act to co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special needs.  The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  This has completely transformed the application process for extra supports for the better.</p>
            <p eId="para_3629">The level of training available to teachers has improved significantly.  The establishment of the Special Education Support Service to provide expert support, professional development and training opportunities in special education for school staff has been very significant. In 2007, the service was in contact with over 15,000 teachers.  The range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to professionals in the special needs area has also significantly expanded.</p>
            <p eId="para_3630">The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) aims to facilitate, for all students, the development of their potential and maximise the benefits of their educational and other experiences, having particular regard to those with special educational needs.  NEPS supports schools and students in the development and delivery of appropriate interventions for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3631">Assistive technology, specialist equipment and building adaptations continue to be provided as necessary.  Special school transport arrangements are made currently costing €50m per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3632">There has been a particular focus in recent years on improving services for children with autism.  In the past year alone, about 100 extra special classes for autistic children have been set up, bringing the total number sanctioned to over 340 classes, and</p>
            <p eId="para_3633">Early educational intervention is now provided for children with autism from  2½ years of age.  There are now 35 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by my Department. Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism aged from 2 ½ years to 5 who are unable to access an early intervention class.</p>

            <p eId="para_3657">I propose to take Questions Nos. 415, 416, 439 and 466 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3658">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect, the education sector, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3659">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes, including notification to schools, will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers, my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels, which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3660">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore, the staffing schedule will be published; it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_3661">At this time, the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to compile either historic information or to create staffing or funding profiles for individual schools requested by the Deputies, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3662">In relation to the school book grant, from 2009 this grant will be available only to schools within the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) scheme.  By limiting the school book grant to schools within the DEIS scheme, savings of €7.5m will be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_3663">DEIS is the action plan for educational inclusion and focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3664">Approximately €7 million was made available in 2008 to DEIS schools at primary and post-primary level for the school book grant scheme; this fund of €7 million will be made available for distribution to schools in the DEIS programme in 2009.  The continuation of the school book grant to these schools is testament to the Government's determination to prioritise social inclusion and protect the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_3665">My Department continues to urge schools to implement book rental schemes as a measure to minimise the cost of school books to all parents.  This was the recommendation of a consultancy report, submitted to my Department in 1993, which dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books.  The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a Code of Good Practice for successful operation of book rental schemes.  My Department fully endorses the report's recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3666">In relation to the provision for teacher in-service education support, €28.8m will be made available in 2009, compared with a 2008 estimate of €33.8m.  It is intended to reduce teacher secondments to in-service and, while it will be possible to continue to provide a wide range of services to teachers, the reduced allocation will mean that programmes that are not in an expansionary or prioritised phase will have to be curtailed to a degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_3667">In relation to sporting activities, school musicals, field trips and student exchanges, I refer the Deputies to my statement to the House on Thursday 4th December 2008 in response to a Priority Parliamentary Question.  I believe that the proposal which I outlined to the House will ensure that such activities will continue in our second level schools in 2009 pending a full review of the substitution and supervision scheme in conjunction with the school management bodies and teacher unions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3700">In general, at primary school level, school transport services are organised to  ensure the maximum travel and waiting time does not exceed 1.5 hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_3701">In regard to children with special educational needs, Bus Éireann endeavours to  provide the best possible transport service for these children. The size of  vehicle required is determined by the number of special needs pupils requiring  the service and the suitability of the vehicle to meet the requirements of the  pupil. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not always possible to facilitate  a child, by virtue of his or her special needs, on a regular school transport  service. Furthermore, many children with special needs travel long distances  from home to the nearest: recognised mainstream school, special class/special  school or a unit that is or can be resourced, to meet the child's special  educational needs under my Department's criteria. Individual school transport,  such as a taxi service, may be deemed to be the most suitable and appropriate  mode of transport.

In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.The various  impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even  with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased  borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3714">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3715">The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any  specific curricular needs of the  school concerned are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective  system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools  retain teachers, though over quota.</p>
            <p eId="para_3716">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally  the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools  for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have  been completed. Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a  transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and  fairly and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_3717">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in  order to create staffing or funding profiles for the individual schools  requested by the Deputies, information which at this time could only be  speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3718">The provision for teacher in-service education support in 2009 is €28.8m,  compared with a 2008 estimate of €33.8m. It is intended to reduce teacher  secondments to in-service and, while it will be possible to continue to provide  a wide range of services to teachers, the reduced allocation will mean that  programmes that are not in an expansionary or prioritised phase will have to be  curtailed to a degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_3719">I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3755">Initially, a completed application form is assessed in accordance with  published prioritisation criteria, assigned a band rating under these criteria  and subsequently advanced through the school building programme consistent with  the assigned band rating.</p>

            <p eId="para_3757">A project brief with the attendant design solution generally remains the same  until delivery of the project unless some change in the school's circumstances  occurs which necessitates revision like, for example, a substantial increase or  decrease in enrolments between application stage and delivery or the discovery  of unforeseen site complications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3758">In the circumstances, once a school applies for large scale capital funding, it  is not necessary for it to re-apply year on year as the original application  remains valid until a project is delivered, if it is still deemed necessary,  with any revisions needed to the design being made as a matter of course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3759">In the case of schools which have applied for funding under the Summer Works  Scheme, as I have stated previously, the Professional and Technical reports  provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so schools  will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_3796">Under the criteria, each project is assigned a Band Rating which reflects the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.

            <p eId="para_3804">In rapidly developing areas where my Department establishes a need for a new post-primary school to meet the educational needs of the area, it is open to recognised Patron Bodies to apply for permission to operate the new school. My Department considers all applications on their merits and also takes into account the desirability of diversity in the classes of existing schools in the general area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3805">Two Community Colleges under the aegis of Co. Dublin Vocational Education Committee were approved by my Department in the period from January 2000 to date and opened from September 2008. These are located in Donabate, Co. Dublin and Phibblestown, Dublin 15. In both cases the VEC applied to my Department for recognition of these schools as non-designated schools to cater for increasing pupil numbers presenting in these rapidly developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3806">Publicly-owned schools (Vocational Schools including Community Colleges and Community &amp; Comprehensive Schools) as well as exercising general control over the curriculum and conduct of the school/college ensure that provision is made for religious worship and instruction for their pupils except for such pupils whose parents make a written request to have their children withdrawn from same.</p>
            <p eId="para_3807">Historically the State funds chaplains in Community &amp; Comprehensive Schools and designated Community Colleges under the VEC. It does so in accordance with agreements reached with Church Authorities at the time of first establishment of those types of schools and reflected in the Deed of Trust for Community Schools and the Model Agreement for Community Colleges.</p>

            <p eId="para_3828">I can confirm that the schools to which the Deputy refers have agreed to amalgamate.  A large scale building project is needed to enable this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_3829">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3830">In the meantime, my Department has sanctioned a grant of €250,000 to provide additional accommodation and to replace some existing prefab accommodation at the boys' school.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3832">The schools to which the Deputy refers are among the schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the Action Plan for educational inclusion. The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010. There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_3833">The schools referred to retained resources, including financial and a shared Rural Coordinator post, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage. When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_3834">While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on these schools, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3835">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_665">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3837">This Government's continued prioritisation of education over the last 11 years is evidenced from our investment in 2009 of €9.6 billion — over treble what it was in 1997. The increase of €302m in the Education budget for 2009 is a real achievement in the current economic climate. Education is one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3838">Each sector in the education system has specific funding requirements which derive from the length, complexity and nature of the education/training courses being provided. The Deputy will be pleased to know that overall provision for primary education has increased dramatically in recent years — from circa €1.9 billion in 2002 to over €3.5 billion in 2008. — this represents a 90% increase since 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_3839">The corresponding increases between 2002 and 2008 for the second and third level sectors are 63% and 49% respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_3840">The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for further improvements to capitation and ancillary grants for primary schools which will increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3841">This builds on the progress that has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200. This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3842">The budget improvements involve an increase of more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_3843">Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get €355 per pupil — or almost €25 extra — in this school year to cover their day to day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting €7,475 more. In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €40,000 to meet its day to day running costs. That same school under these new rates will receive €106,500. This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3844">Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €512 to €986 per pupil — an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3845">We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances. I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3847">The Report of a Working Group to examine potential problems caused by the weight of schoolbags, which was presented in July, 1998, acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3848">One of the main recommendations of the report related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags and in this regard, my Department initiated an awareness-raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3849">A further circular was issued in 2005, again highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of measures that could be adopted at school level in order to alleviate the problem. Ultimately it is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs and that fit with how the school organises teaching and learning. The Report of the Working Group makes various recommendations in this regard, such as optimum use of storage facilities, developing pupil organisation skills and timetabling.</p>
            <p eId="para_3850">My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools on these issues.  Actions taken consist of a range of measures including the provision of lockers and in the case of second level schools the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3851">Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level (mainly in the case of language subjects) school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use in schools are taken at school level. However, the report of the Working Group was disseminated by my Department to the Irish Educational Publishers Association, and they were asked to include consideration of the weight of school texts in their deliberations and liaise with teachers on finding solutions to the issue.  It should be pointed out that the Report did highlight that both teachers and pupils favoured the use of multi-level textbook production for ease of convenience and ease of access and cited a high demand for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_3852">A copy of the report of the Working Group on the Weight of School Bags and all current circulars in relation to this issue are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_3854">Funding of €1 million has been approved from the Dormant Accounts Educational Disadvantage Programme for a scheme to assist 100 disadvantaged schools to progress towards achieving Digital School Status.  The Digital Schools Award is an initiative which recognises excellence in a school's approach to integrating information and communications technology in its learning and teaching.  Having regard to the funding of €1 million being available, the 100 schools identified with the highest concentration of disadvantage have been targeted to benefit from this particular scheme.  Applications were invited from the 100 Primary Urban Band 1 DEIS schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.  As the school in question is not within the scope of the scheme, its application for inclusion within the scheme cannot be considered.  The possibility of extending the scheme in the future to other DEIS schools will be considered in the light of future available resources.</p>
