#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	0	No Members from the junior Government party are present today.  I was intrigued to hear the recent contribution of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government when he described this place as an asylum and said one gets chewed up inside by the scale of the decisions to be made and has sleepless nights, whether one is in negative equity or not.  I was equally astounded to hear his contribution on a recent radio programme regarding the way in which the Government arrived at its decision on the bank guarantee that was signed off on 29 September 2008.  The Minister for Finance and members of the Government have made it clear, on more than one occasion, that this all erupted when the banks were in discussion with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and some civil servants in the Department late on the Monday night and that because of the scale of the immediate crisis, it was necessary to make the decision about the bank guarantee in the way it was made.  That is what the public, the House and everyone else were expected to believe.  However, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has given a very different version, saying there was a meeting of the Cabinet on the Sunday at which the details of the scheme were raised by the Minister for Finance at the conclusion of the meeting and a clear signal was given that there was an impending crisis and that something would have to be done about it.  He made it clear on that radio programme that this was discussed——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	5	My point is that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, gave a very clear impression that this matter was discussed in some detail on the Sunday before the Monday meeting at which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance made their decision.  An incorporeal meeting was held and when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, was contacted, he was about to drift off to sleep, even though he said he was having sleepless nights.On this budget day and in view of the fact that this decision and the manner and consequences of it have effectively put the next generation in hock, what is the truth of the matter?  Was it discussed, decided upon and agreed on the Sunday?  Were the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance given authorisation that if some other element arose on the Monday, they could make the decision they made or was it all done by the incorporeal meeting on Monday 29 September 2008?  This is what I wish to know.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	6	All these matters have been laid out in the report by Professor Honohan.  He set out the whole situation.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance has been speaking to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs outlining the work of the Department of Finance right up to the point——
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	7	He did not tell us anything about what Deputy Gormley said.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	8	If I am given the opportunity to reply I am sure I can clarify the matter.  The Secretary General set out in detail the role of the Department of Finance.  The only issue that arises in addition to what has been said already is regarding the fact there was a Cabinet meeting on Sunday and which has been well reported.  There was a Cabinet meeting relating to preparations for the supplementary budget we were bringing forward in early October 2008.  That is what the meeting was about.  At the end of the meeting, the Minister for Finance gave an update that there were still liquidity issues with regard to our banking system and that it needed to be monitored and that if the situation deteriorated further we would have to return to the issue.  However, there was no detailed discussion about options or anything like that at this meeting; it was simply the Minister for Finance updating the Cabinet as to the state of the play.  On Monday, the situation deteriorated further to the extent that when business closed there was a need for meetings which took place as have been outlined.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Either the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has been misinterpreted here or he is not being upfront with all the facts, to put it that way.  The Honohan report did not report on the facts of the Cabinet meeting in the way that the Taoiseach is now speaking.  The Honohan report said that 75% of this situation was due to our own fault, the Taoiseach's fault.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, said:The Sunday we had a Cabinet meeting and we had gone through it in quite a bit of detail, as I said.  So all the Cabinet Ministers were at home the night the guarantee was given.  It was simply a courtesy call to me because what is required under those situations is that you have, what is known as an incorporeal meeting that is done by telephone....You couldn't just make a decision on the spur of the moment, you would have to have discussed it for days in advance.  Of course not, no.  You just can't do it like that.  Everybody had to be involved in what is the best thing to do in the circumstances so that is incorrect.  It wasn't the spur of the moment decision or anything like that.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	11	We do not encourage Members to read quotations in the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Minister for Finance when he was speaking on 20 January 2009, said, "It was a carefully considered decision arrived at by the Government after consideration of all the factors at a full meeting of the Cabinet".  The full meeting of the Cabinet took place on the Sunday and an incorporeal meeting of whatever Ministers were available by telephone was held on the Monday night.  We need to get this absolutely clear.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is propping up the Government, has a very different view of how this was arrived at from what the Taoiseach is telling us here or what the Minister for Finance has told us.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Could we have a question please?  We are under severe time constraints today, as the Deputy is well aware.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The other fundamental matter is this.  On the debate in the House on the bank guarantee, Deputy Noonan asked the Minister for Finance whether this was a matter of liquidity or solvency and he was told it was a matter of liquidity.  The Government did not tell the truth to the people.  Was the Minister, Deputy Gormley, suffering from lack of sleep when he gave his recollection of what happened?  Was the Minister for Finance right when he said that this was decided at a full meeting of the Cabinet, which took place on the Sunday, or was it decided by the incorporeal meeting on the Monday?  I would like to know that before we proceed into what will be the last budget to be presented by this Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	15	As I have outlined to Deputy Kenny, there were no decisions taken whatever on Sunday.  The incorporeal meeting that was held on the Monday night-Tuesday morning was the meeting that took the decision.  It was not taken on the spur of the moment, as he knows.  There was considerable discussion during that night-time and early morning as to what the best options were in the circumstances.  I do not accept for a moment Deputy's contention.  There is no question of anyone telling untruths whatsoever or not telling the truth about solvency and liquidity.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The issue was based on the knowledge that was available to our Government and the expert advice we received at the time confirmed that an overall guarantee was what was required.  It has been confirmed by Professor Honohan in his report that an extensive guarantee was required, given that if there was not a guarantee to the system, the whole financial stability of the State and the banking system was at risk, and indeed would have had an implosion within days.  Those are the facts.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	18	What about the IMF?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	19	That does not relate as some suggest to new debt or other debt; it was existing guarantees on existing debt.  The only issue that arose subsequently was this question of subordinated debt and, as I say, we made the decision on all that based on the best interests of the country as we saw it.  It related in value terms to approximately 3.3% of the total debts of the banks.  The point is that, as he has confirmed, the issue was on Sunday there was a Cabinet meeting relating to the budget with, at the end of that meeting, an updating and briefing by the Minister for Finance.  As I say, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance has outlined to committees of this House the technical and contingency work that was being done by the Department of Finance in respect of the difficulties that were arising.  A very serious deterioration took place on Monday requiring detailed discussions after markets closed and an ultimate decision taken by incorporeal meeting that morning.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The version of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, of how the decision was taken, which is now contradicted by the Taoiseach, demonstrates the dysfunctional way in which the Government made the decision on the blanket bank guarantee.  It is probably no surprise, therefore, given the uncertainty about how the decision was made that the wrong decision was made.  There is now no doubt but that the decision to provide the kind of blanket guarantee that was included in that decision was a wrong decision, as was the Government's strategy on NAMA and the Government's neglect of jobs in the past three years which has us in the situation where for the 18th successive month the number of people out of work is more than 400,000.  It is that succession of mismanagement, mistakes and bad judgment that has us here today, facing what has been described by many as the worst budget the country has ever faced and which is to be announced in approximately an hour.I and the Labour Party are concerned that another bad decision by Government to take €6 billion out of the economy, to adjust the budget by €6 billion, is a dangerous strategy for the country.  It will damage our prospects for recovery——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Has the Deputy a question?

It will halt growth and put jobs at risk.  Does the Taoiseach have any concerns at all that removing €6 billion poses a danger to the prospects for this country's economy recovery and growth?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	23	First, to deal with the assertions made by Deputy Gormley in the preface to the remarks made regarding the previous question asked by Deputy Kenny or, I should say, Deputy Gilmore.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Do not take from my response to that comment.In regard to the previous issue raised by Deputy Kenny, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, confirmed to an inquiry from a newspaper yesterday evening that the Minister for Finance at the end of that meeting on the Sunday briefed colleagues on problems experienced by the Irish banks in the context of international developments, the preparations and arrangements that were being made in the Department which have been spoken of in detail by the Secretary of the Department to various committees of the House, that the situation was being closely monitored and that the focus was on banking system stability.  He also confirmed that while no formal decision was taken arising from the briefing, some Government action would have to be taken if the situation deteriorated.  The fact of the matter is that no decision was made on the Sunday.  It is not being contended by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, that one was made and any suggestion to the contrary by Deputy Kenny is not well founded, based on the Minister's clarification and confirmation of the situation for fear of any there being any misinformation or misunderstanding.The main question Deputy Gilmore asked relates to his view that a correction of €4.5 billion is the best way forward and to whether the proposed €6 billion correction will create any difficulty.  I heard the Deputy's finance spokesperson say this morning that the reason we are having this budget of a correction of €6 billion is because we have put €6 billion into the banks or something to that effect.  There is this constant effort to associate the need for a correction with the need to repair our banking system.  I reiterate that the fact is that if we never had a banking crisis, we would still have a situation to address in regard to our public finances where there is a gap of more than €18.8 billion, almost €19 billion, this year which has to be closed.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Whose fault is that?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	29	That issue arises as a result of the economic and financial crisis that is affecting every country, including this one, which has its own particular problems.  It is also clear that it is the view of the Labour Party that it does not wish to adhere to the terms and conditions upon which money will be available to this country after July to provide for the services, about which we are all speaking and want to protect to the greatest extent possible in the current circumstances.  It is basically saying that it would not abide by those and that it would put at risk the ability and the necessity of those funds, more than €50 billion over the next three years, to provide the necessary time and space for this economy, which we have stabilised this year.  I reiterate that the budgetary targets we set ourselves last year in a difficult situation have been adhered to, as will be outlined by the Minister in his remarks today.  Our revenues are up €500 million more than the €31 million we projected, our expenditure is under control based on what we said we would spend during the year and that, having stabilised the situation, we now have the prospects of growth.  It was also contended by the Deputy that there would be 50,000 or 60,000 more people unemployed than there currently are as a result of the policies we have been pursuing.  That is not correct.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	30	They have left on the boat.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Thankfully, we still have a situation where the prospects for growth next year will help us if we make the correction, as set out in the programme that has been agreed with the European institutions and the IMF, and proceed with it.  We can bring unemployment down under 10% in the next few years.  If we proceed on another tack, that of the Labour Party's point of view, which is not to proceed with the correction to the extent we suggest, it will not breathe confidence into the economy.  Instead, it will do the opposite.  The important point to make about the Labour Party's proposals is that it suggests we would have an adjustment of €4.5 billion next year, €2.5 billion of which would be raised through taxes, €900 billion on programme expenditure cuts, €400 million on reductions in public sector pay and €1.3 billion on capital programme cuts——

As for the 50,000 that the Government thinks have disappeared, they have disappeared to Australia, America and anywhere but here in order to get a fresh start.

Of course we can all have concerns.  I would have very serious concerns if I listened to the Labour Party, if in government, suggesting that it would not be prepared to make these decisions.

If we had listened to the Deputy and not gone ahead with the correction, the rate of correction would be even greater.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I wish to make a third point in answer to the specific question Deputy Stagg's leader has made — Deputy Gilmore makes it far more eloquently than Deputy Stagg — regarding his concerns about the dampening effects on growth for 2011.  One can look at a number of scenarios in this regard.  The OECD claims growth in the Irish economy next year will be 1.6%, whereas the IMF and European Union predict growth of around 1% but state there will be an increased rate of growth, over and above the average 2.7%, in the following year.  Reuters does a compendium of forecasts where it brings together and blends the views of about ten of the leading forecasters on the Irish economy.  This collective wisdom of a group of people who comment on the economy was released last week and suggests growth next year will be 1.6%.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Minister will outline in his Budget Statement what he regards as the relevant rate of growth for next year based on all of these assessments.  It is well within the very considerable amount of documentation and commentary available on the prospects for the economy next year.  The answer to Deputy Gilmore's question is very simple.  If he wants to be in Government and get a mandate to run this country, he should be prepared to take decisions that will get the country back on the road to recovery.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The people will make the decision.

He should not come in here and suggest he can charge €2.5 billion of tax on working families throughout this country as part of his solution for next year.  That would be the biggest killer of jobs of any package and one that we would reject and refute.

The Government's proposals are absolutely unacceptable.

However, as the Taoiseach will be aware, we have been consistent in objecting to Bills being guillotined.  I understand it is proposed to guillotine the Social Welfare Bill.  This Bill concerns great numbers of people around the country, be they pensioners, people on various schemes or the unemployed.  From that point of view, given these exceptional circumstances, it is a matter on which many Deputies will want to make a contribution.  I object to it on the basis of a guillotine being proposed by the Government.

Yet the Government is proposing that the social welfare Bill will be introduced tomorrow evening.  It is proposed that it will be guillotined at 4.45 p.m. on Thursday.  The financial emergency measures Bill will be introduced then and that will be guillotined and completed by 1 p.m. on Friday.  That is not an acceptable way to deal with what are likely to be substantial measures contained in these Bills.  We do not know yet what those measures will be because the Bills have not been circulated.  It is unacceptable that business would be dealt with in this way.

The indicators again are that the guillotine will apply to the social welfare Bill on Thursday through all Stages.  We then have the financial emergency measures in the public interest No. 2 Bill, which is scheduled to be forced through the House on Friday, with votes on Friday; I find it difficult to recall the last time that took place.  What is the financial emergency measures in the public interest (No. 2) Bill addressing?  Is that the Bill to facilitate a cut to the minimum wage?The whole approach by the Government is to force through the maximum pain on the greatest number of our citizens over the remaining dying days of this Government.  As I said earlier, it has neither a moral nor a democratic right to introduce——

I ask the Taoiseach when it is expected the Dáil will resume after Christmas.  Will it be 11 or 12 January?  Is the Finance Bill and its implications the only matter the Government wishes to deal with on its return?  I ask this for obvious reasons.

That would be important in terms of the issues or concern that can ensue in the public debate.On the question on the return of the Dáil, that is a matter that is to be decided by Government and will be taken next week.  I would be in a position to be able to indicate that we can come back a week sooner than expected, but I would also emphasise there is much legislation that we can and should do in the context of preparation, publication and consideration of the finance Bill which will be done in the normal course.

My recollection is that the date pencilled in for the resumption of the Dáil is 19 January.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the intended date for resumption of the Dáil is 12 January?Last week, I asked the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste about the Government's intention with regards to the legislation required if the Government intends to go ahead with cutting the national minimum wage by €1 an hour, or €2,000 a year, for people on the lowest level of pay in the country.  When is this to be introduced?  Replying to Deputy Shortall last week, the Minister for Social Protection seemed to indicate that it was the Government's intention to sneak in this piece of legislation by way of a Report Stage amendment to the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill which is before the Dáil.  What is the Government's intention with regard to the legislation?  If the Government intends to go ahead with cutting the minimum wage, which I sincerely hope it does not, when and by what means will the legislation be introduced?

The second matter is a subject of the budget announcement today and it has already been indicated in the programme that there will be a reduction in the minimum wage of €1 in an effort to improve employment prospects for people.  It is important that this would be given a statutory basis as quickly as possible so it could well be dealt with this week also.

They should not be taken or sent by any means from the House before the conclusion of his statement.  I now call on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to make his Budget Statement.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	204	This has been a traumatic and worrying time for the citizens of our country.  They are concerned that we had to seek external support to help us with our economic and financial difficulties.  They are worried about the impact of this momentous and difficult decision on all our lives.  Yet, in fact, even in this most intractable and complex crisis, there are clear signs of hope.Amid the turmoil in the financial sector over recent months, it is very easy to lose sight of the fact that economic activity in this country has stabilised.  From a drop of 7.6% in 2009, GDP will record a small increase this year.  Recovery in the real economy is beginning to take shape.  As anticipated, this recovery is being led by exports.  Our exports increased by nearly 7% in real terms in the first half of this year.  Output in the manufacturing sector was up 12% in the third quarter, while surveys point to continued strong growth in export orders for both goods and services.  Agriculture and the agri-food sector has strengthened this expansion.  The growth is broadly based and is being driven not only by a pick-up in demand in our trading partners, but also by the significant improvements in competitiveness that have been achieved in recent years.  Yes, domestic demand remains weak, as households and businesses continue to work off the excesses of the boom.  However, continued export growth will protect and expand high-value employment and stimulate domestically trading sectors of the economy.  This, in time, will reduce unemployment, help build confidence among households and firms and stimulate renewed growth in consumer spending and investment.There are signs too that conditions in the labour market are beginning to stabilise.  The live register has fallen for the third month in a row, the first time since early 2007.  Redundancies in the past three months were more than 30% lower than in the same period last year.  Our underlying budget deficit has stabilised at 11.6% of GDP.  Our tax revenues are ahead of target, despite a weak start to the year, and our spending has been brought under control.  So our actions to stabilise the public finances have made progress.  The balance of payments is expected to record a small surplus next year, meaning that the economy as a whole will be paying its way in the world.  These data taken together paint a picture of an economy that is returning to growth after a deep and prolonged recession.  For the period out to 2014, real GDP is forecast by my Department to increase by an average of almost 2.75% per annum with real GNP growing by an average of just more than 2% per year in the same period.So if the real economy is poised to grow, why do we need the help of the IMF and the EU?  The answer is that we need their support to break the vicious cycle that has threatened our national finances and our banking system since the second quarter of this year.  Following the Greek crisis this spring, funding for the State and our banks became increasingly expensive.  The rising costs of dealing with the banks that became evident during the autumn and the growing concerns about the prospects for the global economy reinforced doubts among international investors about the sustainability of our public finances and our capacity to fix the financial system unaided.  The joint programme of assistance, involving stand-by resources of up to €85 billion, provides us with the firepower we need to restore market confidence, strengthen the financial sector and press ahead with our plans to reduce the budget deficit and facilitate the economy's return to sustainable growth.Without this support, there would have been serious doubts about the ability of the State to raise funds at reasonable cost to pay for key public services and to provide a functioning banking system to support economic activity.  That is the reality.  We are in a position to contribute one fifth of the fund ourselves from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and domestic cash balances.  As I said last week, it is not credible to suggest we could have retained a sovereign wealth fund while expecting others to make resources available to us.  The policies set out in the joint programme, which closely reflect our national recovery plan, are not a new departure.  They are a continuation of the Government's strategy for recovery which has remained steadfast since the onset of the crisis.Over the last two and a half years, the Government has worked hard to get its spending back under control.  We have made very difficult decisions and our citizens have demonstrated enormous forbearance in accepting the need for those decisions.  We have secured an overall adjustment of €14.6 billion.  Without this adjustment, our underlying deficit would already have ballooned to more than 20% of GDP.The budgetary adjustments we plan for the coming four years are large.  But if we postpone them, even bigger and more wrenching adjustments will be needed at a later date.  Our proposed budgetary measures have been laid out in considerable detail to give certainty to households and firms so that they can plan for the future.It is the Government's strong view that the economy can continue to grow while we make the budgetary adjustments outlined in the national recovery plan.  We need to ensure our economic growth is built on solid foundations that are sustainable socially, economically and environmentally.The Government has committed to the introduction of a new national performance indicator to allow a variety of quality of life measurements to be assessed and reported on a regular basis, complementing traditional economic data.  This will be used to guide policy development.  It will allow the public to assess the progress being made across a range of indicators.The CSO is working on the development of this new national welfare index.  Our attractiveness as a country in which to live is an important part of our overall competitiveness.EXPENDITURE AND TAX ADJUSTMENTSThis time last year, it was assumed that an adjustment of €7.5 billion would lead to a deficit of 3% of GDP by 2014, the target year agreed with our European partners.  Given the medium-term growth prospects have been revised down and our debt interest costs have risen, this adjustment has had to be revised upwards to €15 billion.In the national recovery plan, we have set out the timetable for achieving this adjustment over the next four years.  These targets are reflected in the joint programme of assistance.  As the European Commission has more conservative forecasts for the medium-term, we have been given an extra year to reach the 3% deficit target required under the Stability and Growth Pact.  But this changes neither our targets nor our timetable for reaching them.  As outlined in the plan, €6 billion of the overall adjustment is being made in today's budget.  The scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent.In simple terms, the gap between Government receipts and spending is almost €19 billion this year.  This gap must be closed.  We got into this position by seeking, with the full support of those opposite, to spread the benefits of the boom across every section of the population.  Between 2000 and 2008, public spending increased by over 140%, while the consumer price index increased by just 35%.  Working-age social welfare rates are now more than twice their rate in 2000.  Over the same period, the State pension almost doubled.  These increases were well ahead of the cost of living.At the same time, taxation was reduced and the proportion of income earners exempt from income tax increased from 34% in 2004 to an estimated 45% this year.  All of this was made possible by the very large property-related tax intake during the boom years.  In our dramatically changed budgetary circumstances, it is clear the State can no longer afford this level of social provision.The changes I am announcing today are substantial but it is important to keep things in perspective.  The current spending reductions set out in the national recovery plan out to 2014 will bring total gross voted current spending back only to 2007-08 levels.  The income tax measures in the plan will bring us to levels prevalent as recently as 2006.  Those years were not times of hardship.  The reductions will impact on living standards but the fact is social welfare rates are still high in this country and much higher than our nearest neighbour.Budget 2011 continues the task of bringing the cost of our public services back to levels that can be sustained by our economy.  I do not propose to repeat here today the spending reductions that have already been outlined in the national recovery plan and are set out again in the Estimates published today.SOCIAL PROTECTION ADJUSTMENTSThe one area of expenditure in which decisions have not yet been detailed is social welfare.  First, I want to confirm that the Government has decided there will be no reduction in the State pension this year.  We have significantly increased the State pension over the last ten years and it is the Government's view that the security this has brought to older people should be preserved.In the case of working-age rates of payment, there will be a reduction of about 4%.  The Government has maintained these payments at a rate which far exceeds total inflation since 1997.  The 2011 basic working-age payment will be almost 117% more than it was in 1997.  Cumulative inflation over the same period was around 40%.Regrettable as they are, the impact of the reductions is lessened by continued low inflation.  The rates in question will still be slightly ahead of the 2007 working-age rates of payment.  We have built up a generous level of welfare provision over the last decade and though they must now be reduced somewhat, our record of commitment to those in need stands up.Over the next four years, further reductions in social welfare spending are unavoidable if we are to reduce the budget deficit.  The size, nature and composition of these reductions will depend on the rate of decline in unemployment; the effectiveness of anti-fraud and control measures; and the reform of the benefits system.  Our number one priority for 2011 and onwards must be economic growth and maximising employment creation.  That demands improved competitiveness which is at the heart of the social welfare and labour market measures we have proposed.Child BenefitThere will be a €10 reduction on both lower and higher child benefit rates with an additional €10 reduction for a third child only.  These reductions will bring rates of payment back to the 2006 rate for the first and second child and to 2005 rates for the fourth and subsequent children with the rate for the third child reflecting the 2004 rate.  The new rates are still three times higher than they were in 1997.Details of the specific social welfare measures are set out in the summary of budget measures——

The Department of Social Protection is putting measures in place to roll out this additional payment as soon as possible and many households will receive this payment this year.Helping the UnemployedWe know from the 1980s the importance of equipping the unemployed with skills and keeping them close to the labour market.  To that end, we are refocusing the national employment action plan to establish clearer pathways to employment by ensuring that State agencies interact early and often with those who have lost their jobs to provide opportunities for education, training or work experience placements as appropriate.Building on the work placements and training places that have already been introduced, I am providing for an additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed at a cost of about €200 million.The skills development and internship programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the private sector with a contribution from that sector of an additional €38 million or so to pay some of the costs of the internships.The work placement programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the public service.  The Tánaiste announced the scheme in the education sector last week and similar announcements for other sectors will be made by Ministers over the coming months.A new community work placement scheme will provide up to 5,000 additional places in the community and voluntary sector.The labour activation measures will be complemented by the extension of the employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme to the end of 2011 and by the transformation of the business expansion scheme into a new employment and investment incentive.The national recovery plan provides for reform of the labour market and the removal of barriers to job creation resulting from the current level of the minimum wage and inflexible employment agreements.  The aim here is to provide more job opportunities, especially for the young.CAPITAL SPENDINGWe will continue to spend significant sums on investment to sustain growth and jobs.  The Exchequer capital programme will amount to some 3.6% of GNP in 2011.  This programme will be augmented by the investment programmes of the commercial State sponsored bodies.In addition, the National Pensions Reserve Fund has confirmed it is willing to invest in Irish infrastructure assets on a commercial basis in partnership with third party institutional investors.  The Government will help identify opportunities for the NPRF and other private investors.ADJUSTMENTS TO PUBLIC SERVICE PAYI want to acknowledge the substantial contribution made by public servants to national recovery to date.  In my Department I see, day in day out and at weekends, the commitment above and beyond the call of duty shown by civil servants who have accepted significant pay cuts.  More work is being done with fewer staff at lower cost.  This is real public service reform.To meet our targets, the cost of delivering public services must fall further.  Savings will continue to be made through planned reductions in the number of public servants and through greater efficiencies in the way public services are delivered.Despite the economic constraints, the Government has abided by the Croke Park agreement on pay, compulsory redundancies and pension terms.  Public servants, their unions and their managers, for their part, must keep their commitments to pursue flexibilities and reforms in every part and level of the public service.  We have made commitments to a continued reduction in the cost of the public service.  If the Government is to be held to its side of the agreement, those reductions must be delivered.The Taoiseach and Ministers have already taken substantial reductions in their pay.  The effect of the pension levy and the pay cuts introduced earlier this year amount to 28% in the case of the Taoiseach and 23% in the case of Ministers.  The changes in PRSI introduced in this budget as they affect officeholders will bring about a further reduction in net pay for all office holders.  Nonetheless, the Government has decided to introduce another reduction in the salaries of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers.  The salary of the Taoiseach will be reduced by over €14,000 per annum and the salary of Ministers will be reduced by over €10,000 per annum.  This brings the overall reduction in the gross pay of the Taoiseach to over €90,000 and in the case of Ministers to over €60,000.  Details to changes in the Government's transportation arrangements and Ministers' pay and pensions are set out in the accompanying documentation.The Government believes there should be a maximum salary rate of €250,000 in the public sector.  Only a few officeholder posts have salaries above this level at present but there is a larger number in the State agencies.  While there are issues about the contractual position of incumbent post holders, I think the position of the Minister for Finance as a shareholder or statutory stakeholder in these companies can be used to enforce the objective of the maximum salary within a reasonable timeframe.

The €250,000 maximum will be applied to all such offices.A reduced maximum rate of pay of €250,000 will apply to the next President of Ireland.  I want to record the significant contribution made by the current President who, since this downturn began, has waived a significant portion of her remuneration.I intend to make provision for these reductions in legislation.In addition to reduced pay rates, all new recruits to the entry grades of the public service must start at the first point of the relevant pay scale without exception.  Although recruitment will necessarily be limited over the next number of years, this measure will ensure a medium-term reduction in the overall cost of public service pay.PUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONSThe cost of providing public service pensions has increased significantly in recent years.  Pensioner numbers have grown from 76,000 in 2006 to about 103,500 this year.  That is an increase of 36%.  Expenditure has risen by 56% from €1,433 million to €2,235 million in the same period.Public service pensioners have so far been unaffected by the reductions imposed on serving staff.  The Government considers it appropriate that those pensioners who can afford to should now share the burden of adjustment.  Accordingly, public service pensions above €12,000 a year will be reduced by an average of 4%.  Those on a pension below €12,000 a year, roughly equivalent to the value of the social welfare pension, will be exempted.  The reduction will be applied fairly.  Those on higher pensions will pay most.  It will apply to former political officeholders, retired members of the Judiciary, and their survivors or dependants.

The grace period, under which previous salary levels are to be used to calculate pension entitlements, was due to expire by the end of 2011.  This is being extended by two months to prevent a build up of public service retirements in 2011 and to spread the extra pension lump sum costs over a more manageable period in both 2011 and 2012.  However, I want to make clear that public servants or officeholders retiring during the grace period will be subject to the pension reduction I am introducing today.  Legislation to provide for this reduction will be brought before the Oireachtas later this week.  Further details are provided in the summary of budget measures.Reducing the income of pensioners is an exceptional measure, but these are exceptional times.  The Government has to make savings, and pensions costs are a very significant part of public expenditure.  Failure to reduce the cost of pension provision could undermine the longer-term viability of the public service pension system.  Furthermore, it would be unfair if highly paid pensioners remained unaffected while serving staff on low pay have had their pay reduced.A new single pension scheme for new entrants, which I announced in last year's budget, will come into effect in 2011.  This will bring future public service pensions more in line with private sector provision.  Pensions will be based on career average earnings rather than final salary, the pension age will be increased and post-retirement increases will be linked to retail price inflation rather than to pay.  This new scheme is a crucial part of the longer-term reform required to put the public finances on a sound basis.  The legislation will be published very shortly to ensure that the new scheme can be put into operation for new entrants in 2011.TAXATIONA Cheann Comhairle, the primary purpose of the tax system is to provide the resources to pay for the services the public expect from the State.  Our tax system no longer fulfils that purpose well.  The line of least resistance would be to increase the rates, but revenue is generated by economic activity and not by increased tax rates.  High tax rates on a narrow base of economic activity may raise far less revenue than lower rates on a much wider base.  We cannot have a tax system that damages our potential to grow.  That is why the Government has decided in the national recovery plan that two thirds of the required budgetary adjustment over the period from 2011 to 2014 should be through expenditure reductions and one third should be raised by taxation.Our income tax system, as it stands today, is no longer fit for purpose.  At one level, too few income earners pay any income tax.  This year, just 8%, earning €75,000 or more, will pay 60% of all income tax while almost 80%, earning €50,000 or less will contribute just 17%.  At another level, too many high earners have opportunities to shelter their income from tax.  Both of these structural defects must be addressed.  Our system is also unduly complex.  With four separate charges on income, each rational in its own terms, it contains too many distortions, steps, and discontinuities.  Our goal must be to create a system that is rational, sustainable and fair, and that delivers the resources needed for essential public services.Income TaxSuch a system cannot be created in one budget, but today we take a major step forward in the reform process.  In this budget, we will:abolish the income levy and the health levy;replace both with a single universal social charge, governed by one set of rules on a broad base;remove the employee PRSI contribution ceiling;increase the PRSI rate for the self-employed, higher earning public servants and officeholders;reduce the value of bands and credits by 10% in line with overall reductions in incomes;tackle excessive reliefs associated with private pension provision;abolish or restrict many tax reliefs that higher earners use to shelter income unfairly, andtarget the remaining reliefs more clearly on employment growth.By broadening the base at both ends of the income spectrum, the nominal rates of tax can be kept lower while the effective rate can be raised in a way that is fair to all.  In the measures I am presenting today, those on the new reduced minimum wage will not be brought into the tax net.  The top marginal tax rate will be kept at 52% for all taxpayers.As I said in the 2010 budget, the universal social charge requires that everyone makes some contribution, however small, to the provision of services.  This charge is separate from income tax which is levied proportionately as income increases.  The universal social charge does not apply to welfare payments.The changes made today generally either maintain or enhance the incentive to work relative to social welfare.  For a married couple with no children earning €25,000, their net income will fall by 2.8%, or €12 per week.  For a similar family with two children, net income will fall by just 1%, or €5 a week.  We must always ensure an appropriate balance between the rewards from work and income support from welfare.  I believe that in these most difficult of circumstances we have struck the right balance in today's budget.Our objective is to move steadily in the direction of an income tax system that is fair, universal in its application and more easily understood.  This budget marks a decisive step towards a unified income tax system with a minimum of tax shelters, the broadest base and competitive rates.  A unified income tax system with appropriate tax credits will facilitate the closer integration of tax with the welfare system.Broadening the Tax BaseIn last year's budget, I said high earners availing of tax incentive schemes must contribute more in the current difficult circumstances. The restriction of reliefs measure, which increased from 20% to 30% last year, is already having a significant impact.  But we can and must do more.  The national recovery plan contains a commitment to the abolition or the curtailment of tax expenditures and to the phased abolition of property-based legacy reliefs.  The 16 measures identified in the plan will be given full legislative effect.  Today, I will abolish or restrict a further nine reliefs bringing the total to 25.  Full details are set out in the summary of budget measures.Many property-based reliefs have been already abolished, but some legacy costs remain.  Such costs will be further restricted as a result of today's changes.  Three new measures in particular will be targeted at passive investors: restrictions on the carry forward capital allowances will start in 2011 and impact progressively over the next few years; from 2011, section 23 relief will be restricted to income from section 23 property; and a "guillotine" provision will ensure that all unused capital allowances after 2014 and section 23 reliefs are lost.  This last provision will effectively terminate all property-based reliefs in 2014.  Again, full details are set out in the summary of budget measures.The base for capital acquisitions tax on inheritances and gifts is being broadened by reducing the tax-free thresholds by 20%.  This reduction follows the economy-wide fall in asset values in recent years and builds on a similar measure introduced in supplementary budget 2009.  Finally, I am increasing the deposit interest retention tax rate on ordinary deposit accounts by 2% to 27% and on longer-term deposit accounts by 2% to 30%.Tax Treatment of PensionsThe national recovery plan contains a commitment to significant reform of pension tax relief.  Today, I am abolishing employee PRSI and health levy relief on pension contributions.  I am reducing the annual earnings cap for tax-relievable pension contributions.  The portion of retirement lump sums above €200,000 will be subject to tax and the maximum allowable tax-relieved pension fund will be reduced.   Employer PRSI relief on employee pension contributions is being reduced by 50% from 1 January next.The effective tax rate on approved retirement funds will be increased by raising the deemed annual distribution of assets in those funds from 3% of end-year assets to 5% per year, with that distribution subject to full income tax each year.  Details of all these measures are in the summary of budget measures.Business and EmploymentTwo weeks ago, all political parties in this House supported a motion calling for the maintenance of the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  Our commitment to the 12.5% rate was restated in the national recovery plan.  I welcome recent comments by European finance ministers who understand the importance of this issue to Ireland.  There will be no change to Ireland's corporation tax rate.Better Focusing Tax Reliefs to Create More JobsSmall and medium sized companies are the wellspring of employment and innovation in the economy.  The business expansion scheme has helped companies to gain access to capital investments.  But given that job creation and protection is the top priority, it is essential that schemes like the BES and the three-year corporation tax exemption for start-up companies are targeted and evaluated against jobs created or retained.  Accordingly, the BES is to be revamped and renamed as the employment and investment incentive.  This incentive will come into operation once the necessary approval from the European Commission has been received.  In the meantime, the existing scheme will continue to operate.Under the new incentive, the limit that can be raised by companies will be increased from €2 million to €10 million, and the amount that can be raised in any 12-month period will be increased from €1.5 million to €2.5 million.  In addition, the certification requirements will be simplified.  The new incentive will expire on 31 December 2013.I have decided to extend the three year corporation tax exemption for start-up companies commencing a new trade in 2011 and to amend it so that the relief will be linked to the amount of employers' PRSI paid by the company.  This change will focus the relief on employment creation, rewarding new companies that create jobs.  I have also decided to extend the accelerated capital allowance scheme for energy efficient equipment for a further three years.  Further details of the changes are set out in the summary of budget measures.Bringing Confidence to the Housing MarketI am undertaking a fundamental reform of stamp duty on residential property transactions with immediate effect.  This has three aims: to stimulate the property market, to provide necessary valuation information and to increase market transparency for the smooth operation of the market.  There will be a flat rate of 1% on all residential property transactions up to a value of €1 million with 2% applying to amounts above €1 million.In line with the base-broadening approach adopted in this budget, I am abolishing all existing reliefs and exemptions for stamp duty on residential property.  This means that 1% will be paid on all residential property sales, new or old.  If this system had been in place instead of the previous volatile one, it would have lessened the effect on tax revenue of the booms and busts in the market.  The information gathered from this new regime can be used to compile data on house valuations to inform a valuation database.  This data will bring a far greater degree of transparency to the operation of the housing market that has been previously absent.  Markets operate best where buyers and sellers have reliable information available to them.The new rates will apply to property transfers on or after tomorrow, 8 December 2010.  A transitional provision will be put in place to ensure that anyone who has entered into a binding contract to purchase a residential property before 8 December 2010, and who executes the transfer of that property before 1 July 2011, will not lose out.The tenant purchase scheme allows local authority tenants to purchase their homes at a discount.  Today, I am announcing a short-term improvement in this scheme.  This will allow greater access to tenant purchase by introducing a higher discount for existing tenants.  The details of this enhanced scheme will be set out by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.Fostering Compliance Within the EconomyThe construction sector has been at the vortex of this economic downturn.  It will be some time before the sector returns to a sustainable level of output.  In the meantime, the Government wants to ensure that existing employment levels are protected and allowed to grow by reducing black economy opportunities in the industry.  Today, I am proposing significant reform of the relevant contracts withholding tax regime which applies to contractors in the construction, meat-processing and forestry sectors of the economy.To foster compliance, a new withholding rate of 20% will apply to subcontractors registered for tax with an established compliance record, with the existing 35% rate retained for subcontractors not registered for tax.  In addition, the system will be strengthened to enhance its effectiveness and reduce the opportunities for fraud.  The proposed changes provide a cash flow benefit to registered subcontractors that will enable them to compete for business on a level playing field.The recent cold weather conditions once again demonstrate the benefits of ensuring that homes are as energy efficient as possible.  Today, I plan to introduce a new tax incentive in this area which will support employment while improving energy efficiency in homes.  The new incentive will complement the grant aid that is available through the home energy savings scheme currently available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.Standard rated tax relief will be available on expenditure up to €10,000 on a list of approved works.  The total relief available under the scheme in any one tax year will be €30 million which would allow for remedial works to be carried out on a minimum of 15,000 homes.  Contractors employed to complete the work must be registered with the Revenue Commissioners.  This incentive, together with the proposed changes in relevant contracts tax will support construction businesses operating in the legitimate economy.  Full details of the new incentive will be provided in the Finance Bill.Supporting TourismAn air travel tax on passengers departing Irish airports was introduced on 30 March 2009.  The tax is expected to yield €105 million in 2010, despite the impact of volcanic ash on air travel earlier this year.  Similar taxes apply in the UK, France, Australia, New Zealand and the US.  An air travel tax will apply in Germany and Austria from January 2011.  There had been calls for the abolition of the tax, which is blamed for the reduction in our visitor numbers.  Having examined the issue in detail, I have decided to introduce a single revised rate of air travel tax of €3, to come into effect on 1 March 2011.  I wish to be clear that this reduced rate is being applied on a temporary basis until the end of next year.The position will be reviewed next year and the rate will be increased unless there is evidence of an appropriate response from the airlines.

Much of what is said is plain wrong.  For example, it is regularly claimed that the taxpayer will end up bearing most or all of the cost of the banks' bad loans.

As the Governor of the Central Bank has previously indicated, over the period 2008 to 2012, the total loan losses of the domestically-owned banks are expected to reach €70 billion to €80 billion, equivalent to approximately half of this year's GDP.  Loan losses on this scale are unforgivable.  They reflect the recklessness of lending decisions during the bubble years and the weakness of the previous regulatory framework.  We must ensure they never happen again.What is almost entirely overlooked, however, is the fact that tens of billions of these losses have been absorbed by the private shareholders in the banks.  It is clear there has been no taxpayer bailout for bank shareholders.  Neither has there been a bailout for holders of banks' subordinated bonds.  These bondholders have absorbed losses of about €7 billion to date and legislation to facilitate further burden-sharing by subordinated bondholders will be submitted to the Oireachtas next week.

As I said in this House last week, there is simply no way this country, whose banks are so dependent on international investors, can unilaterally renege on senior bondholders against the wishes of the our European partners and the European institutions.  This course of action has never been an option during this crisis.It is true the State has had to inject large amounts of capital into the banks.  In return, the State will own the bulk of the banking system.  The use of funds in the National Pensions Reserve Fund to recapitalise the viable banks is necessary to ensure that these institutions serve the needs of the economy.The approach to fixing the banks agreed under the joint programme will not reverse any of the Government's banking policies.  In fact, the very opposite is true.  The programme builds upon and intensifies the measures introduced to date.  The most senior members of the international team negotiating the programme have endorsed our policies.CONCLUSIONThis budget is the first instalment of the national recovery plan.  The plan plots a course to sustainability for our country: sustainable public finances, sustainable public services, sustainable growth and sustainable employment.  It is a sensible, rational plan that is proportionate and equitable in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Everybody pays and those who can pay most will pay most.  The plan calls on us all to take more responsibility for ourselves, to contribute to the support of local services and to pay more towards the support of college education.  This budget is not captured by any sectional interest.  The focus in the distribution of the tax burden, in the reductions in public spending and in the reforms it introduces, is the common good.I believe that politics in this country must put the common good at the centre of the stage in all that it does.

Any reform proposals, whether they relate to the Dáil electoral system, the future of the Seanad, the composition of Departments or the size of Government, must have as their objective the pursuit of the common good.Since I was appointed as Minister for Finance in May 2008, I have been dealing with the worst crisis in our history and one that has few international parallels.

In every measure that has been introduced on behalf of the Government, we have sought to stabilise our public finances.  In doing so, we have sought to protect those most in need.  Analysis using the ESRI model has shown that the measures I have introduced on behalf of the Government's have been progressive and have distributed the burden of adjustment fairly.It is clear to us all what went wrong in our economy.

The appetite of a rampant building industry for labour and other resources put upward pressure on our cost structure.  As a result, our competitiveness was damaged and we lost market share for our goods and services.

We have broken with precedent in key appointments.  Professor Patrick Honohan, our foremost academic expert on banking, is a widely regarded Governor of the Central Bank.  Mr. Matthew Elderfield, a highly qualified and experienced professional, is our new Financial Regulator.  We have introduced new legislation to reform the regulatory framework for our banks and the Central Bank has greatly increased its resources.We have set out a programme of budgetary reform in the national recovery plan and legislation providing for a fiscal responsibility law is in preparation.  This will ensure that the principle of keeping the public finances on a sustainable footing is binding in law.In other words, the Government has faced up to its responsibilities.

The underlying strengths of our economy, built up over many years by our citizens and by the actions of successive governments, have survived this crisis.We continue to have a highly skilled, flexible labour force with one of the highest levels of formal education in the OECD.During the boom, we built a world class road network; we invested in our public transport, our education and social infrastructure.  Continued capital investment in the next four years will ensure that the economy is well equipped for recovery.We have developed a highly competitive, pro-enterprise taxation system which incentivises innovation and high-value economic activity.  The measures I have introduced today will benefit our domestic sectors that have been especially badly hit by this downturn.  We will defend our 12.5% corporation tax rate against all comers.The actions we have taken in Government over the last two years have helped us to regain competitiveness.  Wages have adjusted and costs have fallen.  More needs to be done but we are pricing ourselves back into global markets and the performance of our export sector is the proof of our success.We know we can have sustained, balanced, export-led growth in the economy.  We had it in the past and we have what it takes to win it back if we pursue the correct policies.  We have been through a tumultuous two years culminating in our application for external assistance.  Today's budget is our first step in ensuring that we can get back firmly on our own feet.  It is a substantial down payment on the journey back to economic health.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	250	This is the budget of a puppet Government, which is doing what it has been told to do by the IMF, the EU Commission and the European Central Bank.  It is doing so in order that the State can draw down the bailout funds now that the country is insolvent.  This budget is in an ironic way a fitting tribute to this failed Administration.  Fianna Fáil, like the Bourbons, has learned nothing and forgotten nothing, and it is destined to continue its mistakes in this its last budget.  These mistakes are easily recorded, but their consequences are tragic.The Government's policies have wrecked the economy, destroyed the confidence of the people, put 450,000 people out of work, forced more than 100,000 of our young adults to emigrate, increased poverty and undermined any concept of social justice in our society.  The Government has made three major mistakes and it continues to make them today.  The two harsh budgets, which were introduced to correct the fiscal crisis, were incoherent in policy and undermined their own objectives.  The Government never learned that one cannot cut and tax one's way out of a recession.  One can only grow out of recession.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	254	On fiscal correction, the intentions of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, were sound but his policies were woefully misguided, so the more he did the worse it got.  Then some months ago the country became insolvent, or to put it bluntly, we went bust.The misguided budgetary policy would not on its own, however, have destroyed the country.  The destruction of the county is due to the fatal banking policy.  Think of the hubris of a small country guaranteeing €450 billion of funds, think of the decision to bail out Anglo Irish Bank at a cost of €32 billion to the taxpayer, and think of the extraordinary imprudence of NAMA.  Think of the failure of regulation, think of the child-like belief that the banks were telling us the truth and think of the failure to hold anybody to account.  Think of the decision to keep the directors of the banks in place and the decision to recruit new management from the second tier of existing management.  Think of the failure in the third year of investigation to forward a single file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

How could anyone have confidence in an Irish banking system underpinned by this set of policies promoted by the Minister and his colleagues in government?The financial problems of the sovereign State were difficult but they were manageable.  When, however, bank debt became national debt, the position became unsustainable.

That is why it is out of the bond market because if it went to it, it could not borrow any longer.  Ireland has become insolvent and that is why we have to be rescued by Europe and the IMF.

Juncker, Reynders, Rehn, and Trichet and separately to Mr. Strauss-Kahn of the IMF.  The first two sentences in both of the Minister's letters reads as follows:Ireland faces an economic crisis without parallel in its recent history.  The problems of low growth, doubt about fiscal sustainability and a fragile banking sector are now feeding on each other, undermining confidence.What a self-indictment; the Minister's critics could not have done better.  It is an absolute indictment of his own policies as set out in both of the letters he wrote to our new masters in Europe and in Washington.

When one reads the letters, they sound like confessions beaten out of him, as if one were reading a thriller.  It is as if they water-boarded the Minister in Merrion Street and made him sign the letters, or perhaps they were motivated by the mock humility of the gombeen culture to think that he would get the €85 million more easily if it was a handout.

The dream of restoring a lost Camelot is always a huge mistake.  Bertie Ahern's Ireland is dead and gone and it will never be restored.

The bubble cannot be reinflated and the Government policy designed to restore lost times cannot succeed.  We need a new Ireland, a lean and more generous Ireland, where we support strong families and strong communities, where volunteerism is again honoured, and where people work hard and are rewarded for their work.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	279	We need a reformed political system and a talented, fit-for-purpose public service needs to be developed once more.  We need new policies to support growth and jobs.  A fatal flaw in this budget is that there is nothing in it to get the economy growing again.  The Minister will recall that even though his four year plan published two weeks ago is based on a growth rate in 2011 of 1.75%, on 29 November, the European Commission marked that down to 0.9%.  His figures will not reach target unless we have growth in the economy.  He has been advised of that by the European Commission and he is still persisting in proceeding without any growth or jobs strategy.We need a fair and just society where the test of any policy is in the answer to two very simple questions   Is it a fair policy and does it protect the most vulnerable in society?  It is against these objectives that I intend to measure this budget.The Minister was very sparse in his detail today.  Two minutes before he sat down we got a résumé of the main features of the budget.  It is difficult to know quickly when he does not read out the major detail of the budget what exactly are the full implications of it.  If we take the public expenditure area first, of the €6 billion correction, to which the Government has committed, €4 billion amounts to public expenditure cuts and €2 billion amounts to taxation.  It is very difficult to know what the expenditure cuts are in the documents presented.  We had an experience in the olden days when Mr. Haughey was king of the country where a budget would be presented and when we came into government we found the figures did not add up.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The Taoiseach will be in here tomorrow and I want him to state clearly the policy decisions that will underpin the expenditure cuts registered in the tables at the back of the circulated document.  I hope the Government is not faking it.  I want the Taoiseach to explain the expenditure cuts.I notice that in the four year plan there is a figure of €700 million for the sale of State assets.  The tables in the back of the circulated document put the figure at €660 million but there was not one reference to this in the Minister's speech.  I am told the figures come from the intention to sell Bord Gáis and the Minister has permission from the European Commission to pay this into the Exchequer by way of dividend; yet the Minister was totally silent on it in his speech.  When I see such things I worry about the accuracy of the Minister's figures.

The Minister stated he would cut the tax credit by 10%, which is fairly obvious, although the universal social charge is still a mystery.  This charge, as those with a long memory recall, comes from an announcement last year by the Minister that he intended to put the health levy, PRSI and the income levy together.  When questioned in the budget debates, if I recall correctly, the Minister said the tax-neutral position for this charge would be 7.5%.  It would be tax neutral in that it would collect the same amount of revenue but have a distributional effect; it would be harder on poorer people and less onerous on wealthy people.When I prepared the alternative budget proposals in the past few weeks, which were announced on Friday, we ran the proposals by the Department of Finance, which did an independent costing.

Curiously, the Minister mentioned in today's speech the introduction of a universal social charge but did not nominate the rate at which it would be introduced.  That is not fair and when a budget is presented, it must be transparent.

I do not understand why a Government would be so socially blind as to include vulnerable persons where the total tax take is so small anyway.  The Minister could have got most of what he wanted from the main social welfare headings but he has hit invalidity and blind persons' pensions, along with carers and widows.  That is what we mean on this side of the House when we say the Government does not really care about the most vulnerable.  Our policy is to protect the vulnerable in our budget cuts.

NAMA has destroyed the property market as it has taken everything out but put nothing back.  Before leaving office the Minister should call people from NAMA into his office and tell them to put €2 billion or €3 billion of property on the market at fire-sale prices.  These may be sold too cheaply but at least that would establish a floor in the property market and people would start again.  Currently, everybody is watching prices continually falling and nobody will get into the market because they believe prices will fall further and people are waiting until they hit bottom.  Somebody must put a floor on this and the only people with a big enough pool of assets is NAMA.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	332	A tranche of assets should be sold, even if they must be sold cheaply, to get the process started again.  The 1% universal levy on all property, with 2% on properties worth more than €1 million, is onerous enough.  It means nothing now because there is no market but it will be a heavy enough charge when the market picks up.  I suggest that in the course of the finance Bill the Minister should consider a capital gains tax on the family home, which would be much less onerous.  The problem with the proposal is it will hit everyone who is in negative equity and all those who paid significant stamp duty over the past ten years.  If one made the change through the capital gains code, one could exempt these categories, from which one would not make a profit in any case.  I am suggesting an alternative means of raising tax through stamp duty.Many of the changes in public service pensions had been announced.  While public servants will not like the levies, which had been announced previously in the four year plan, many of the former public servants to whom I have spoken told me that, ultimately, they do not object to being treated on an equal basis with existing public servants.  In the times that are in it I will not quarrel with that view.The Minister did not do anything for people in negative equity, which is serious gap.  The Fine Gael Party has a proposal in this area for which it will not charge the Government a penny if it is implemented in the finance Bill.  If one were to increase to 30% the tax relief available to those who bought at the top of the housing market between 2004 and 2008, it would save those with a mortgage of €300,000 about €900 per annum.  This is a targeted relief which one could pay for by withdrawing mortgage relief for sales completed from June 2011 onwards.  My party had this proposal costed by the Department.  Anyone who buys a house from next June is buying at the bottom of the market.  They do not need assistance through the tax code to buy property because they are buying at knockdown prices.  I ask the Minister to examine these proposals and try to make some adjustments.The Minister proposes a whole series of excise duties.  We will examine these in the course of the debate on the financial resolutions tonight.  He has also made proposals on the salaries of Ministers and Deputies and proposes to cap public servants' salaries.  If we, in this House, do not start cutting our own prospects and salaries, we do not have the moral authority to prescribe tough medicine for others.  It is not clear what the Minister proposes to do regarding Members.  Will a Deputy of 30 years standing be considered a new Deputy if he or she is re-elected in March next?  If so, will he or she be hit by the 10% reduction in salary for new public servants?  Is that the Minister's intention?  The phrase he used is ambiguous.  The position should be spelt out explicitly and without riddles because members of the public want to know what is happening with our pay and conditions.I thought the Minister would take the opportunity to introduce the changes in VAT he announced in the four year plan.  It is the Government's intention — it has negotiated this in the deal with the IMF — to increase the 21% VAT rate to 22% in its second or third budget and 23% in its third or fourth budget.  While the retail sector will not like this change, much of the goods on which the higher rate of VAT is charged are imported.  The Minister should restructure his proposal in this regard and try to do something for employment by reducing the lower 13.5% rate of VAT to 12%.  While it should be reduced further, if possible, the Minister can certainly afford to reduce it to 12%.  The lower rate of VAT applies to domestic sectors such as the building and service industries, including restaurants, the food trade, bars, hairdressers and newspapers.  Service industries are significant employers who have low margins.  A small adjustment in the VAT rate would get people back to work in these sectors.I am not making a political point in stating that the Minister could introduce a series of supply side measures to get more people back to work.  Reducing the lower rate of VAT is one measure that would work because it would reduce costs and get people back to work.  The Minister has tried to achieve this goal by reducing the minimum wage by €1.  My proposal is an alternative approach which would probably provide good value.The Fine Gael Party has also proposed that the 8.5% rate of employers' PRSI should be abolished for employees earning up to the level of the minimum wage.  This, too, is a low cost measure which would save an employer who takes on a new worker €30 per week.  It is difficult to employ low skilled young people at the bottom end of the market.  For this reason, the Minister should consider what economists describe as supply side initiatives.  While I am aware he does not have billions of euro to spend, the measures I propose are focused and targeted at increasing employment and securing more growth in the economy.  They also have the great advantage of costing very little.The Minister was silent on carbon tax.  I thought the Green Party had convinced him that he should move again on carbon tax but he has chosen to move on excise on fossil fuels.  He must make up his mind on how he will tax fossil fuels.  Will he continue on the excise route or opt for carbon taxes?  When one takes both options everyone is hit twice.  It is not long since a significant increase in carbon taxes was introduced and now we have another increase in excise.My primary objection to what the Minister is doing is that he does not have a jobs and growth industry.  He did not mention the agriculture and food industry which is back on its feet, thank God.

I have been assured by Commissioner Rehn and Mr. Chopra of the IMF that they will co-operate with us in doing so.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	336	There is a flaw in Ireland's approach to Europe, one which arises from the hubris of the Celtic tiger years.  Since we joined the European Union the Department of Foreign Affairs has taken the lead role in our relationship with the EU and individual member states.  When Garret FitzGerald, whom I see in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, was Minister for Foreign Affairs and Taoiseach, it was common for Ireland to enter into informal alliances with other member states, particularly smaller countries, to advance our interests.  We had close alliances with the Benelux countries in particular.  In the past decade we have lost our way and forgotten the friends who used to protect our interests.At a time when boastful Irish Ministers could clear any bar from Berlin to Barcelona with their lectures on how to get rich through property speculation and how Ireland was the wealthiest country in Europe and a model for all to imitate, it was easy to forget our friends.  When Irish Ministers were the braggarts of Europe it was easy for our friends to forget us.  We must now mend our hand.  Our skilled diplomats must again be instructed to build alliances with member states who share our interests.  The central role of diplomacy in protecting our interests and relationships in Europe must be restored.In this regard, it was disgraceful that Ireland was not represented by a Cabinet Minister when a major new initiative, the issue of euro bonds, was being discussed at yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers.  This is an example of neglect.  While the Minister for Finance may have been busy with the budget, the document was completed at the weekend.  Why did a Minister not attend yesterday's meeting which discussed a far-reaching proposal to introduce a euro bond given that acceptance of such a proposal could solve many of Ireland's problems?  The president of the euro group, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, who is Prime Minister of Luxembourg, a country that is a traditional diplomatic friend of the Irish, was the main proposer of the introduction of a euro bond.  No Irish Cabinet Minister was present at the meeting to push along a project that is in our vital interests.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Despite everything that has happened, I do not believe our country is ruined beyond repair.  If it were not for the banks, our problems would be manageable.  With the recently announced initiatives to downsize the banks, we can come through this.  The foundation stone of everything is certainty.  The Fine Gael Party is committed to reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014 and to a total adjustment of €15 billion because we want to give people certainty.  Once we have certainty we can build confidence in this country.  This is the reason Fine Gael is committed to an extensive jobs and growth programme.Once we have confidence people will grow in hope and optimism and begin to spend and invest again.  This is the reason the Fine Gael Party believes the marginal rate of income tax must be kept low, the 12.5% of corporation tax is an essential component of our industrial policy and the 13.5 % rate of VAT should, as I proposed, be reduced to 12% when the standard rate is increased.  fine Gael wants a pro-jobs tax policy so that the economy can grow and jobs can be created.  My party believes we can meet our budgetary targets for the next two years and we hope that after two years of meeting our budgetary targets we will be back borrowing in the bond market at a much less penal rate than the 5.8% negotiated by the Government in the bail out package.Fine Gael wants the IMF out of here.  We are an educated, talented, accomplished people, well capable of running our own affairs.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	341	At the opening of his speech, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to households and businesses that continue to work off the excesses of the boom.  He made the adjustments and cuts sound like a walk in the park just after the Christmas dinner or, alternatively, like joining the gym or going to Unislim.  It is a way of working off the excess built up during the boom years.  It is a pity that such slimming of income has been applied to working people and those on middle incomes because they are the people doing the heavy lifting in this budget.  I daresay the Minister must be aware that people with children took the biggest cuts this year and last year.   Let us remember child benefit is paid almost universally to women.  I suppose that is a comment on how few women are Members of this House and what little political power women exercise compared to bankers.  The Minister always says "Yes" to bankers but in his different budgets he always finds it difficult to make payments in respect of children.The table of reductions in expenditure is spot on.  Well done to the Minister, who has passed the first test in the memorandum of understanding.  It is spot on for the IMF and the European Central Bank.  The reductions of €2,192 million are very close to the figures in the memorandum so when they are sent over on Friday, as per the memorandum of understanding, I imagine the Minister will get one star for getting so close to the required figures.  However, it is very noticeable that out of cuts of €2,192 million, the Department of Health and Children will take a cut of €746 million and the Department of Social Protection will take a cut of €873 million.  Those two Departments, Health and Children and Social Protection, will take a hit of €1.6 billion from total cuts of €2.1 billion.  That is a really heavy hit on a particular sector which, more than any other, encompasses the notion of social solidarity and need.  We should remain a one-Ireland society.  Yes, we had our billionaires but we should remain close to that notion.  The principle of the Labour Party is that we are a one-Ireland society and those who have most should contribute most.Coming after 13 years of Fianna Fáil misrule, this budget might be described as the last sting of the dying wasp but it is a fairly vicious sting and one that carries a long tail life, not only for today but for the coming four years.  The people who will feel the biggest sting will be those with children.  I shall return to that issue presently.  There is enough austerity in today's announcement by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to make even the most ardent Tea Party fan grin in delight.  There is pain for the poor, money for the rich, particularly for the bankers, and the rolling back of the State.In Ireland, we are now entering our third and a quarter year of fiscal austerity.  It is very important that all the international cameras and press which have been covering this country should understand this fact.  This is our sixth budget or adjustment statement since July 2008, shortly after Deputies Brian Cowen and Brian Lenihan were elected to their current offices.  The first five budgets and adjustment statements took €14.6 billion out of the economy but those in the austerity and hairshirt camp want more.  The Irish are a little like Oliver — "Please sir, give me some more austerity".  Today, €6 billion of further austerity will bring the total taken out of the Irish economy over three and a quarter years to an eye-watering €21 billion, or 16% of GNP.I and my party met with the IMF on a number of occasions during the recent talks and it was very clear to us that those people clearly understood there is no modern example of a developed economy deflating to this extraordinary degree but claiming it can grow like Topsy.  The €21 billion of deflationary reductions risks putting Ireland into the dreaded deflation spiral, the terror of the Hoover years of the Great Depression in the United States.  That is why the Labour Party argued for an adjustment of €4.5 billion, which, of course, would be extremely tough.  There is no doubt about that.  However, we wanted to promote and leave room for the certainty of growth.  I met Mr. Rehn when he was here and discussed the magic figure of €6 billion which had appeared.  I talked with him about what had happened in Finland and Sweden during those countries' banking crises.  Mr. Rehn told me that the Swedes had learned a great deal from the Finnish banking crisis and what the Finns did, in nationalising and taking the banks into temporary public ownership, and so on.  Then he said, "And Ireland ... " but he left any further comment unspoken.  Ireland did not learn from Finland or Sweden.  This budget smacks of Ireland having done case studies in Japan, with all the unfortunate effects of zombie banking on that economy.  Unfortunately, we have mirrored that situation to an extraordinary extent.  Japanese people who live in Ireland talk continually about the close parallel between what happened in their economy and what is happening now in Ireland.  Japanese people I know tell me what the next thing will be.It is very unfortunate.  Mr. Rehn, having delivered the €6 billion adjustment, I presume on behalf of the ECB, last week came back and reduced his forecast for the Irish growth rate to 0.9%.  What has all the austerity and deflation done for us as a country so far?  In more than two a quarter years of austerity, unemployment has risen from 4% to 14%, which is 435,000 people.  Austerity has slashed growth, it has killed consumer confidence and turned us into a nation who are busy paying down debt or saving — anything but spending.  Those who study the behaviour of people in depressions, in particular shopkeepers and not just economists, can tell one that in a great depression such as we in Ireland are enduring, people change their spending patterns permanently.  People who know people who lived through the great depression in the USA know that those people remain what the Americans call "frugal" and "tight" right to this day because they had the searing experience of what happened to them then.  Many people fear that all this austerity is doing the same to Ireland.  When walking down Grafton Street, one used to see people with two or three shopping bags.  One would need to be a very dedicated, well off fashionista to come from Grafton Street with two or three shopping bags nowadays.  One is lucky to see one shopping bag, often just a tiny one tied up in a bow.What else has austerity done?  It has brought the return of the emigrant aeroplane.  It is reckoned by the ESRI that by next April 100,000 people will have left this country, some of them our brightest and best young people who will have left during the austerity period of the first quarter of this budget.  It is very sobering, particularly in regard to people who came home and began to build a life here and then left again.  We know that GAA clubs throughout the country, not just in rural areas but even in Dublin, can no longer be sure of getting the guys and girls for teams at weekends because they have gone away to get work as, unfortunately, many of their grandfathers and grandmothers also did.  It is very sad for people in Ireland to have to relive this experience.The European Commission and ECB are understandably outraged at what they see as Ireland's fecklessness but should the punishment be visited disproportionately on the more vulnerable sections of Irish society?  Ever since the fall of Lehman Brothers, the Government and orthodox economists have insisted that bank losses should be socialised whereas bank profits during the boom years were privatised.  The debt burden which Ireland now carries, and which this budget is designed to ensure we repay, smacks more of reparations than of repayments.  A more holistic approach adopted by our international "helpers", with burden sharing of the bank restructuring, including by bondholders and foreign banks, and a longer timespan would leave us better placed to repay and to be part of a European wide reflation.  In the end, this would be better for Germany as well.In one of Keynes's best known works,  The Economic Consequences of the Peace, he predicted that reparations to be paid by the German people after the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles would produce an economic and political catastrophe.  To quote Keynes, “If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp.”Europe and the European Union has an extraordinary range of achievements to its credit and membership of the Union has been exceptionally beneficial for Ireland and its people.  The European Union rests on a fundamental concept of solidarity.  Without the glue of solidarity, Europe as a concept could be fatally undermined, not just in Ireland but in all those weaker countries, from Greece to Portugal and even to Spain, Belgium and Italy.  A new Government should seek, as a priority, to renegotiate the terms.  We need a cheaper interest rate, a longer timeframe and the kind of interest rates the IMF would normally apply to a country like Ireland, which could be as low as 3.2% and as high as 4.2%.  That is the kind of interest rate the Government and its negotiators should have negotiated for our people.I know that many people are nervous of market reactions to large public deficits and sluggish growth.  Let us imagine the market reactions to no growth and much larger deficits.  What has driven the panic in the bond markets over both Ireland and Portugal is just that.  There was the belief that both economies would be stagnant in the coming years and, therefore, would become even more indebted because we were so mired in the consequences of our banking failure.  Growth matters desperately to Ireland's prospects.  Ireland, Spain and Portugal — all very different economies — are crudely lumped together in a bond market sin bin.  We can escape from that sin bin if we can restore confidence in future growth from all sectors of the economy, not just the export sector.  This means getting ordinary people buying and spending again, not just saving.Who are the winners and the losers in today's budget?  The winners are undoubtedly the banks, both Irish and foreign, which are hoovering up our money, not just to bail out Irish banks but to bail out the bondholders who so foolishly lent to our out-of-control bankers and developers.  There is no doubt Ireland had exceptionally greedy and foolish bankers and developers, who borrowed like crazy when the flow of cheap money from the euro zone seemed literally like the gold at the end of the rainbow.  There is no doubt Ireland and its failed system of governance and regulation carries the major share of the responsibility.  However, some responsibility must be borne by those foreign banks which lent so recklessly and greedily.  The ECB, from its lofty perch, should have been more familiar with bubbles.Another class of winners are those developers and property tycoons whose comfortable exile has been enabled and abetted by our kind and generous Government regime, which permits those who owe billions of euro in unpaid loans safe and easy transfer of very large amounts of assets to spouses and family — perhaps all those tycoons with their multi-million pads in nice places like Connecticut, within easy commuting distance of New York city, like Mr. Dunne and Mr. Drumm.  We read all about them in the newspapers, this weekend and every weekend.  To use the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan's phrase, "they continue to party on" — it is Unislim for the rest of us but party time for them.Who are the losers?  A family with three children will lose €40 a month, which is in addition to the previous cuts in child benefit last year, where they lost a significant amount.  Jobseeker's benefit is being reduced by €8 and there is a cut to disability benefit.  Most of those on disability benefit have limited capacity for work and their expenses are normally higher due to their disability but their benefit is being cut by €8 per week to €188.  In addition, a payment to a person who is blind is down by €8 to €188 per week and carer's benefit is also being cut by €8 to €204 per week.  Payments for those with adult dependants have been decreased by €5 per week.  Therefore, a couple in these categories will experience a reduction of over €13 per week.  That is tough when one is on a fairly tight income.  People in these categories are certainly losers.Other losers are the small and medium businesses, in respect of which the budget does not mention the flow of credit.  We were promised credit would flow like milk and honey once NAMA got under way.  Instead, NAMA seems to involve a reverse proposition sucking life out of the economy because its operations are so large.  NAMA is probably the biggest property company in western Europe and it dominates a huge sector of commercial activity.  The people who provide professional services charge service fees of up to €240 million per year and NAMA is sucking the capacity out of banks to give credit to SMEs in the villages and towns of Ireland.I believed the Government, including the Minister, would have had something to say about the people who are under water or in difficulty with their mortgages, particularly after the Government Members' experience of campaigning in Donegal.  These mortgage holders are facing Christmas terrified that they may lose their homes.  The Government, in addition to saying "Yes" all the time to bankers, could make an effort to provide people with certainty that they will not lose their family homes, particularly when those family homes are also the homes of their children.A popular show that many teenagers like and produce is called "High School Musical", one of the hits of which is called "We're all in this together".  Bearing in mind all the catch-phrases and soundbites that come from this dejected set of Ministers, nothing grates more than the sound of our two Brians repeating, "We're all in this together".  I have news for them: nothing in this budget offers a shred of evidence that they really believe this themselves.  Every line of the budget suggests the exact opposite.At the end of this set of Fianna Fáil budgets and as a direct result of the Government's policy, the gap between rich and poor will have widened.  Ireland, after this budget, will be a more divided society than ever.  It is the disadvantaged who will carry the bulk of the cost and those whose reckless antics caused the disaster will survive best of all.  While their wealth will be diminished, they will have escaped, waiting for the chance to strike and come back again.The experience of past recessions shows the legacy of the past three years will be long-lasting.  Unemployment at an early age can leave permanent scars.  Many studies have shown that someone laid off during a recession suffers an earnings loss even when he returns to the labour market.  He returns to less well-paid employment and earns less than those fortunate enough to remain in work.  Even 15 to 20 years later, these losses continue to take their toll.  There are wider social costs.  The loss of a job has a marked impact on health and results in an average loss of life expectancy of one to one and a half years.  Children suffer when their parents are laid off.  They are more likely to fall behind in school and tend, on average, to earn less than the offspring of those who stay working.It is remarkable how standard orthodox policies have come a cropper in the past few years.  Unemployment is a case in point.  According to the Tea Party types, countries with flexible labour markets and low minimum wages find it easiest to adapt to the more challenging environment while those countries that insist on higher wages for workers reap the consequences of being soft.  However, it has not turned out like this.  Remarkably, Spain, which took the orthodox route, has a youth unemployment rate of 40%.  Germany and Norway, which have protected workers rights, have kept their jobless rates at low levels.  Therefore, I do not buy the argument that there should be a reduction in the minimum wage.We all know about the famous three Rs that are the bedrock of early education.  There is another set of three Rs that became the bedrock of economic recovery in the post-Depression era and formed the basis of the post-war politics in Europe, irrespective of the country or party in power.  These three Rs are reflation, redistribution and reform.  If the Labour Party is in Government after the next election, reflation, redistribution and reform will be what its participation in government will be about.Governments have abandoned financial regulation with the calamitous consequences that are evident today.  Where would we be now if there had not been some international reflation in 2009 after the shocks of 2008?  The Taoiseach constantly points out, correctly, that our export sector does well.  It has continued to do well because of international reflation.  However, if the rest of the world had experienced the deflation that Ireland has experienced, our export sector, which unfortunately is not as employment rich as it once was, would not be doing nearly so well.The Government must bring the budget into balance by a reasonable target date.  The least plausible way of doing this is to starve the economy excessively of money in the short term.  An adjustment of €6 billion is excessive at present.  Next year is not the first year of a four year plan.  As stated, we have already endured two and a quarter very difficult years, and adjustments amounting to €14.6 billion in the past two years.  Can the Taoiseach honestly state the adjustments have achieved their objectives?  If he cannot claim this, how can he prescribe more of the same medicine?Why is the Government doing what it is doing?  To some extent, it is because it is mixing with the wrong people.  It has forgotten the advice of religious teachers in school on the dangers associated with keeping bad company.  The Taoiseach and his party mixed with developers for years and wined and dined with them.  They gave the developers every tax break and subsidy they demanded.  They now associate with bankers, who are totally obsessed with the security of their position and, therefore, with budget harshness.  Do Members recall that after the Taoiseach very kindly bailed out Anglo Irish Bank on the first occasion, Mr. Seán FitzPatrick stated on the radio, without a moment of self-reflection, self-awareness or shame, that he wanted cuts to the old-age pension, child benefit and all social welfare payments.  He asked people to take their medicine and to give the money to him.  This is what the Taoiseach achieved; he gave the little people the medicine and gave Mr. FitzPatrick's bank, Anglo Irish Bank, the money.

The IMF and the International Labour Organisation have carried out detailed studies.  A recent study by them contains a message for the Government and the Taoiseach's party.  The IMF-ILO study states:Fiscal plans should be fair.  There should be specific measures to protect the most vulnerable from the effects of the consolidation.The risks involved with high levels of unemployment mean that economic policy should have a bias towards growth.  There should be no fetish for austerity and targeted measures aimed at vulnerable groups of workers should be retained.  Alongside that, countries should boost minimum wages, offer social protection and encourage collective bargaining.When America entered the war after 1941 and the attack on Pearl Harbour, the anniversary of which is today, Churchill went to Newfoundland to meet Roosevelt where they set their aims for what their countries would be like after the war.  What did Roosevelt insist, and Churchill agreed, on inserting in the war aims of the new society that would emerge after all the difficulties?  He insisted on building in social protection and employment and the growth of a society that had a social construct.One day this recession will end.  We know that.  If the Taoiseach keeps having much to do with it, it will be a long time before it will end.

It is very telling that his Government has chosen to use the term "charge" and not "contribution".  When the welfare state was built, the term that was always used was "contribution" because a contribution implied that if one contributed to one's country and one's State during one's working life, one's child or children would be assisted with their education.  When people became older, society would also assist but instead of a contribution we now have a charge.  In terms of the rates on the charge, the new charge will start at 2% for people earning from nought and €10,000, 4% for people earning from €10,000 to €16,000 and 7% for people earning over €16,000.  For many people on the lowest levels of income that is a fairly hefty additional level of charge.  It is significant.The tables in the budget dealing with who pays tax are interesting.  The numbers of people who are paying the standard rate of tax is increasing by 53,000.  An additional 53,000 will be paying the standard rate of tax and 91,000 people will be paying the higher rate of tax.  A total of 144,000 people will be in the tax net.

We suggested that the tax shelters, particularly the property-based tax reliefs which have cost this country so much, be closed this year.  That would have allowed a slight easing in terms of people at the lower income level or people on social welfare.  We also suggested that the pension reliefs, 80% of which are targeted at the top 20% of earners, should be drawn back.  We proposed taking a leaf out of the Conservative Party's book in England and reducing the size of the pension pots and the draw downs.

Three years ago Ireland was paying €1.5 billion a year in interest.  I ask the Taoiseach to bear in mind all those women who will lose their child benefit and the heavy lifting, so to speak, they will have to do as a result.  Of the €6 billion adjustment, €5.1 billion will be the extraordinary bill for interest to be paid by Ireland under this fantastic deal the Taoiseach negotiated for us.

It is like going back to the time when one was a child and one went to meet one's Dad to collect the wages from him.  Instead, officials from the Department of Finance will be going on a Friday afternoon, cap in hand, with their list of figures.  Could the Taoiseach's negotiators not have spared us that little extra humiliation?  Look at the IMF deals for other countries.  I have compared a number of them and when I read the Irish deal, I cringed for the small humiliations that were included in it, in my view, entirely unnecessarily.  The Government ought to have had the courage to say, at least, "No", to a few of those.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	406	This budget is a disgrace.  It is a full-frontal attack on the lowest income earners, those who are unemployed and those who are dependent on social welfare.  What it amounts to is a recipe for economic suicide.  It is another deflationary budget being brought in by this Government.It is being brought in by a Government which claims to act in the national interest, by a political party which claims to be republican.  It is at times like this that one must ask what would the founders of the State think about what has gone on earlier today in this Chamber.  What would people who struggled to bring the Republic into being think — the people who gave their lives and the people who laboured to bring the Dáil into being and to bring the dream of the 1916 Proclamation into being?  We have not got their yet, but I am sure that they would be ashamed of what has gone on in this Chamber today.Before I walked in here and before the Minister for Finance rose to his feet to announce this budget I watched our national flag being taken down above this building, and I am glad that it was done because what has been done in here is economic treason.  Not only is the Government happy to sell out our economic sovereignty to the IMF, but now it is selling out the Irish people.I think back to a poem penned by Pádraic Pearse nearly 100 years ago, "Mise Éire", lines of which state:Mór mo náir:Mo chlann féin a dhíol a máthair.My great shame:My sons who sold out their mother.That is what has happened here.  The Minister has sold out the ordinary average people, who caused no harm to the Government and who have done nothing wrong in the State but try to get on in life.  These people have tried to build the public services which we want to be proud of and have tried to go to school and to third level education so that they can be the entrepreneurs of the future.  These are people who, through no fault of their own, are dependent on social welfare.The Government has decided in this budget to launch an all-out attack on those people while at the same time protecting the elite in society, protecting the backsides of Members who sit in this Chamber.  I have read through the documents accompanying the Budget Statement.  Not one penny from a Deputy's gross salary will be reduced.  How does the Government think the people listening to this at home or on the radio as they travel home from work can understand that a Deputy on over €92,000 per year should not take a pay cut but somebody on social welfare, somebody who is out working who has a child with a disability or who is on disability benefit needs to take a 4% reduction?  Is that fair?  Those are the questions people are asking.  Ministers are talking about taking token wage cuts of €10,000, which, in reality,——

What have they done?  What have the public sector workers done to the Government that it will sack 9,500 of them — 4,150 from health, 1,023 gardaí who will lose their jobs by the end of next year, and 1,063 teachers and front-line staff working in the education system?  A total of 9,500 public sector workers are to be made redundant under the Government's plans.What did the farmers do to the Government, which will reduce the REPS payments by €36 million?  What did the students, who want to get educated in third level, do to the Government that it will increase the student fee to €2,000 and introduce a new fee for those on PLC courses of €200?  God forbid, what did the primary school students do to the Government?  It is introducing a new transport charge of €50 and increasing up to €350 the charge for those at second level.  This budget is a disgrace.Last year we heard the Minister for Finance tell us that the worst is over.  Now we hear that low and middle-income families are to be hit with more punitive taxation increases and spending cuts.  The Minister tells us that there is hope, but the only hope I can see is calling a general election.  His Budget Statement is sparse in detail on the cuts but we can see in the documentation provided what these cuts will mean and how they will affect people in the years ahead.  There is an €8 reduction for dole recipients, a €10 reduction in child benefit and €180 less in tax credits, excise on petrol and diesel is up, rental relief to be phased out, maternity benefit and adoptive benefit cut and there is to be a 5% reduction in capitation fees for student services and a reduction in student support grants.  Some €746 million is to be taken out of the health budget.  A total of one third of all of the cuts across departmental spending is coming from health.  This is at a time when the health service is completely buckled under the strain of the cuts that the Government has introduced in previous years.Why are we doing all of this?  Why is the Government introducing the budget that it has announced today?  It is doing it to prop up a failed banking policy.  The policy behind this budget is not only morally wrong, but economic sabotage.  Some €6 billion is being taken out of the economy in the most destructive and damaging way.  The Government has decided today that somebody who earns over €1 million contributes enough but a person on the minimum wage, a person on social welfare or a person who has lost his or her job must pay more.  The Government has lowered the disposable income of every spender in the real economy.  What that means is that there will be less money to spend in the local economies, which will turn the screw tighter on local businesses and will mean more job losses in small and medium enterprises.  What the Government has done is prolong the cycle of recession.I do not know how the Minister had even the neck to come in here and present such a budget.  The Government has failed the people of Ireland.  It has given away our sovereignty in the same way that its partners gave away our natural resources back in the 1980s.The Government has brought the IMF and the EU to our shores, and they are here to help the Government to protect foreign bankers and to bail out the bondholders.  They are not here to bail out the Irish people.  They are here for our tax euros.  They are not here to protect us.What is disgusting about all of this is that when the country is demanding political reform, when people are shouting out for serious politically reform, the Government is relying on the votes of two gombeen politicians who want their own wee pet projects in their own constituencies.

The fact is we can no longer afford this type of politics.  We simply cannot afford it.  We need a new type of politics.During the course of writing the budget speech, did the Minister for Finance ever consider what it would mean to ordinary people on the street who are suffering because of what he and his Government have done?  When was the last time he took a trip to a social welfare office and spoke to those dependent on the dole?  When was the last time he visited a school completely made up of prefabs with more than 30 children in a classroom with only one teacher?  These are the questions I would like to ask him.  It is easy to talk about statistics and about people as groups but the Minister for Finance and many others in the Government are members of the political class and the elite.  It does not matter to them what effects the cuts will have on the ground because they will never have to experience them.  The same goes for the right-wing economists who will be cheering on these measures of austerity.  The reality is that the Government and these Ministers will never see a dole queue.  They will never have to choose between paying their bills or putting food on the table.  They will never have to send their children to school hungry.  They will never have to emigrate.  What we will see is the Minister for Finance, his colleagues and the backbenches trotting down to the Dáil bar and celebrating another budget after which they will be driven home in their ministerial cars.  They will take home their wages every week and when they retire or are kicked out of office, they will have a great pension to live on for the rest of their days.

What has happened is that the Minister and the Government have repeatedly misled the Irish people.  If spending cuts were the solution then we would not have a deficit now and we would not have to be back here.  We would not have a problem with our public finances.  The clear message I want to give today is that there is an alternative and a better way and Sinn Féin has put forward that better way.  It is clear, deliverable and costed alternative based on fair taxation, eliminating waste, growing the economy and creating jobs.  Our alternative protects the most vulnerable——

Our alternative would see the cuts announced today reversed.  I am calling on everybody going into the next general election and who wants to go into government to commit themselves to reversing the budgetary cuts announced today.

If we proceed with this banking plan, then the budget and the four year plan are already redundant.  The plan aims to adjust €15 billion from the State's finances over a period of four years.  It is a figure that sits in splendid isolation from the €85 billion bailout negotiated for the banks.

Most importantly, we cannot afford the Government.

It is important to emphasise that €17.5 billion of the €67.5 billion will come from the pockets of the Irish people.  Who decided this figure could be lumped into the bailout from the IMF and EU?  It is being presented to the Irish people as them coming in to rescue us.  Again, we see a Fianna Fáil spin in action, trying to tell us that they are coming in with a package but in reality much of this is our own money that is bailing out——

What the Government is trying to do is turn a banking crisis into a sovereign debt crisis and it has been aided by its partners in the EU.  All of this is about political choices.  It is about having the political will to stand up and put ordinary people first.  That is what the Government should be doing today and it is what Sinn Féin would do.  Those on the Government benches know the budget will cause untold hardship for hundreds of thousands of people.  It will mean little hope of economic recovery in the years ahead.  It is a disaster for society and a disaster for the economy.

We have a structural deficit apart from the banking crisis that must and can be addressed.  It has been caused by the Government's steadily eroding the tax base, allowing unemployment to rise and allowing a culture of waste and excess to develop in sections of the public sector.  Latterly, it has been added to by the Government obsession of the banks and the debt servicing interest that will be incurred by this.We can reduce the structural deficit but it must be done hand in hand with growing the economy in a sustainable way.  Sinn Féin has put forward a six year plan to reduce the deficit to within the Stability and Growth Pact, beginning with an immediate €4.671 billion reduction of the deficit in 2011.  This can be made if public spending is eliminated and the taxation system is overhauled.  We have identified more than €1 billion in wasteful spending and more than €4 billion through making the taxation system fairer.  When we put forward our six year plan, the Taoiseach excluded us from the talks in Government Buildings.Fine Gael and Labour leapt on the four year bandwagon and were invited to join the consensus on cuts, which they did all too willingly.  We said it could not be done in four years and that the cuts would make everything worse.  What have we seen since?  The European Union has already extended the adjustment period by a year to 2015 and it is widely accepted that even that is too optimistic.  Again, we have been proven correct.If the Government laid out a credible strategy to restore the economy to a growth trajectory, the bond markets would have more confidence that Ireland would be able to pay its debts and, therefore, yields would lower accordingly.  The Government strategy to date has simply focused on the deficit, without enough attention to the wider economy which is the engine that provides both tax revenue and contributes to overall GDP.  The deficit is a result of our economic woes, not the cause.  If we treat the causes — unemployment and the tax collapse — the deficit will be treated.  The four year plan is a joke.  It is an accountancy exercise with no economic impact assessment.  If taking €4 billion out of the economy in 2009 reduced the tax take by €7 billion, what will a €6 billion adjustment do?  Also, it is based on the most ludicrous assumption of growth ever imagined by a Government about to slash the State's finances.  The Minister announced average projected growth rates of 2.75% today.  He should get real.  The international community is laughing at him.I now want to deal with some of the specifics of this budget.  Bad economics, tax cuts, deregulation and tax subsidies for speculators during the boom got us into this mess and the bad economics of this budget, with its spending cuts, slashing of incomes and stealth taxes will dig the hole deeper.  The four year plan indicated that €3 billion would be taken out of the social welfare budget by 2014.  Details on what this means have been revealed by the Minister today.  People have lost their jobs and these unemployed people are sitting at home tonight in cold houses.  However, the additional €40 fuel allowance announced today will only go to households in receipt of the fuel allowance.  The Minister pointed to low inflation as a justification for cutting social welfare rates by 4%, but prices for many essential goods and services have actually increased.  All one need do is look for example at health, education, transport and energy costs, which have all increased.A survey conducted by Sinn Féin of 278 social welfare recipients last week clearly demonstrated that families on social welfare simply cannot afford to take the hit.  Almost 90% of those surveyed will go without bare essentials, whether food, heating or Christmas presents.  How are people supposed to live on the welfare allowances announced by the Government?  Cutting social welfare should be the last thing the Government does in a time of economic difficulty.  Cutting social welfare will have a detrimental effect on the economy and society.  Welfare payments are always returned to the economy.  They are not saved or invested abroad but spent in the real economy.  They are spent on rent, mortgages, food, utilities and other essentials.  Cutting welfare is a false economy and will only cause misery and hardship for those on the receiving end of the policy.  If less money is spent, the economy will contract, businesses will struggle and more jobs will be lost.  More people will be reliant on social welfare.Do these cuts make any sense?  Of course they do not.  However, cutting benefits is the policy the Government is pursuing.  Sinn Féin is absolutely opposed to any cuts in social welfare and to the cuts announced today.  We have shown where the revenue could be raised to ensure that welfare rates are protected.  It is a matter of political choice whether to start cutting at the top where the highest paid and the wealthy can afford to take cuts or at the bottom as the Government has done, targeting those struggling to get by and barely able to survive from day to day.  Any Deputy who votes for these cuts deserves to be kicked out at the next general election.The Minister has told us that it is too complicated a task to make the tax system fairer.  Why is it too complicated a task to reform the taxation system so that those on huge salaries contribute more, but not too complicated to consign the poorest to a life of scrimping, saving and poverty?  If one looks at the public finances, it is apparent that we have less of a spending problem and more of a tax raising and retention problem.  There is ample room for overhauling the taxation system, without turning Ireland into a high tax economy.  Sinn Féin has shown how this can be done and how €4 billion could be immediately raised, with the least negative impact and effect on the economy.  Instead, the tax changes in this budget once again target the least well off, those on the minimum wage and the low paid.One of the biggest spins pedalled by the Government is that we must extend the tax system to those who do not pay any tax.  This compounds the ignorance of the Irish tax structure.  Let us set the record straight.  Ireland relies disproportionately on indirect taxation and always has done.  For every €100 received by the State in direct taxes, some €146 is paid in indirect taxes by every man, woman and child.  These taxes disproportionately hit lower income earners.  Yesterday, I was asked in an interview whether I thought such a large group should not pay any taxes.  I replied that it was easy to talk about groups, but that we should break it down and look closer at the issue.  We believe that a person earning €300 a week already pays enough tax.  Today, the Government has told us how much it thinks they should pay.  This extra tax must now be absorbed into all their other bills, their rent, food, child care and electricity.  Which service does the Government think they will think drop first?  They cannot afford to drop any of them.  The tax increases announced today are spread across the board and fail to target those who have the ability to pay.  This is a big mistake, one that will damage the economy and consumer spending.The changes in taxes and bands will be as follows, based on a 10% reduction.  The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €36,400 for a single person to €32,760, putting more people in the higher tax rate bracket.  The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €45,400 for a one income married couple to €40,860.  The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €72,800 for a two-income married couple to €65,520 and the cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €40,400 for a single parent family to €36,360.  It is clear the screw is being tightened once again on the lowest paid, punishing them for the Government's incompetence and the recklessness of the banks, but there are no increases in tax for top earners.  No 48% tax band has been introduced nor has a wealth tax been introduced.The decision to abolish the income levy and health levy and to create a universal charge is a step backwards.  This is a flat tax and this change will benefit the better off.  The cost will be the same for everybody, regardless of their ability to pay.  We did not support the income levy when it was first introduced, but at least it was somewhat measured, so that those on lower incomes would pay less and those on higher incomes more.  However, the universal levy will in effect represent a cut for top earners, while lower earners will be brought deeper into the tax net.The Minister did not mention any increases in VAT today, but we know they are coming.  These increases will push up the cost of living, disproportionately hit low earners and will cause chaos for businesses, particularly those trying to survive in Border communities.  We need to start from the top down and make those who have most pay most.  That seems totally alien to the Government.  A wealth tax could and should have been introduced as part of this budget.  Wealth taxes have been successfully implemented in other European countries and form an essential part of those governments' revenue streams.  However, rather than introduce a wealth tax, our Government prefers to cut social welfare benefits and to drag the low paid deeper into the tax net.  Despite the economic collapse, there is still considerable wealth in this State.The top 1% of the population in this State owns 20% of all the wealth.  Our proposed wealth tax would raise €1 billion at a conservative estimate in the form of a 1% income linked tax on all assets including property worth in excess of €1 million but excluding working farm land.The Government could have introduced a range of other measures to raise revenue while making the tax system fairer.  It could have immediately standardised all discretionary tax reliefs to raise €1.1 billion, introduced a third tax rate of 48% on incomes in excess of €100,000 to raise €410 million or increased capital gains tax to 40% to raise €240 million.  None of these measures has been introduced.The cuts to public spending bear no logic.  The amount being cut will be detrimental to services that are already struggling.  Health and education will suffer most of the brunt.Salaries of public servants should have been capped at €100,000.  This would have saved €350 million for the State per year.  The Government instead chose to make aesthetic cuts to the highest paid civil servants.  The head of the HSE earns in excess of €300,000 per year.  The heads of our semi-State companies earn more again.  Padraig McManus of the ESB was reported as earning over €750,000 per year, at a time when this Government introduced three budgets that took the legs from those on low incomes or social welfare.The Taoiseach and the rest of the Ministers earn more than most of their European counterparts even though they bankrupted the State.  The Minister for Finance claims that very few people in the public sector earn over €250,000 but a report published in the summer found that 66 public servants in Ireland, including 37 judges, the head of NAMA and the head of the NTMA, receive more than €500,000 each.  Even with the so-called pay cuts taken by the Taoiseach and Ministers, the Taoiseach still earns €36,000 more than David Cameron.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	490	Through the successful efforts of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, our public health budget subsidises the private health care sector to the tune of billions of euro although not everyone can afford private health care.  This is where savings could have been made instead of sacking nurses, cutting front-line services and closing wards and beds.  That is what Ministers would have done if they had any moral fibre.Once again the Government has opted for flat rate reductions in child benefit, which is paid to every child in recognition of the fact that this State does not provide free health care, free education or free anything for children.  In this State, a parent has to pay a doctor an average of €60 to have a six week old baby treated.  If the Tánaiste believes that some parents can afford to get by without this benefit, she should have gone after their incomes through the tax system.  She cannot justify going after the payment in a way that hits poor and rich alike.Health spending is to be cut by €1.4 billion over the term of the four year plan.  The Government wants to take out €746 million next year.  The health system is already in crisis, with services being cut across the State.  I have seen first-hand in Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals the destruction that successive budgets have done to our health service.  One has only to consider the distance that many patients are forced to travel to access health services, the length of the waiting lists or the numbers who are waiting on trolleys.If these cuts are implemented there is no doubt that waiting lists will lengthen.  Understaffing will result in further misdiagnoses and more people will be left on trolleys for days.  These health cuts will cost lives.  Even while waiting lists grow and patients suffer as they wait for operations, over 1,500 beds lie closed in our public hospitals due to cuts.  The cuts in this budget will close hundreds, if not thousands, more public hospital beds.  Prescription charges have already been imposed on medical card holders while drug companies continue to make vast profits.  In the past week an average of 300 patients were on trolleys in accident and emergency units in our public hospitals.The recruitment ban in the health services means that fully trained nurses and doctors are being educated to the highest standard but forced to emigrate with their degrees.  This budget will accelerate the brain drain from our health services.  Supporting and funding preventative health makes sense and saves money.  Cutting funds for these services makes no sense.  Has nothing been learnt from the disastrous health cuts of the 1980s?  The cruel reality in the years ahead will be that if one has money one will live but if one cannot pay, one may die.Overall, this is a terrible budget for education.  In times of recession we need to make education the gateway to recovery.  Year after year, this Government did the opposite by imposing cuts on the disadvantaged, school buildings, special needs and capitation grants, as well as charging fees to students.  This Government is intent on making education the preserve of the rich.  Gone are the days of free education and back are the days of underfunded schools and exorbitant fees.The Government is introducing an overall reduction of 21% in capital expenditure for education, including 9% for primary schools and a whopping 20% for secondary schools.  This is a scandalous situation.  Children will continue to be educated in prefabs. Money will continue to be wasted by being paid in rent to private prefab suppliers.  Classes will be unable to cope with more children and less room.  We could have invested in school buildings.  We could have created much-needed employment in the construction sector by taking off the dole those who have skills to build schools and classrooms.The capitation funding for primary schools is being reduced by 5%.  Schools are already struggling with large class sizes and limited resources.  The Government is now limiting these resources even further.  The capitation grant pays for the day-to-day running of schools.  The reduction will force schools to rely on families to fund raise in order to keep their doors open.  Special needs education is being cut by 2%.  We have already seen special education classes close down and special needs assistants sacked.  What happened to protecting the vulnerable?Grants to secondary schools will be cut by 9%, VECs will suffer a 3% cut and the registration fee is being increased to €2,000.  This is tantamount to introducing tuition fees through the back door.  The Government purports to want to build a knowledge economy.  The reality is this fee will lead to thousands of young people being unable to attend college or get a third level education.Once again the Government has brought forward a budget that contains no real funding for a stimulus plan.  It has rolled out Minister after Minister to speak about stimuli.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have announced job creation numbers to beat the band but nobody has spelt out how this will work or how it will be paid for.  The Government estimated in the four year-plan that there would be a 0.25% net employment loss in 2011.  There are almost 450,000 people unemployed now, yet the Government is planning for even higher unemployment levels.  Fianna Fáil and the other parties talk about stimulus, but none of them has real plans or costings to back this up. Sinn Féin has a plan.  We propose a once-off transfer of €7 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for a jobs stimulus.  This amount is the equivalent of what was pumped into our banks at the start of this year.  Instead, the Government is agreeing with the IMF and the EU in proposing to take billions from the same pensions reserve fund and put it into a black hole, which is the banking system.  With the right policies and supports, jobs can be created in sectors such as agrifood, tourism, IT and green technologies.  We can have a new generation of entrepreneurs and revitalise the co-operative sector.The Government can always find additional billions to invest in banks but it cannot find a single cent to invest in economic recovery.  We have shown where money can be found.  It is the domestic economy, in which people live, that is flatlining and that needs attention.The public will not take this budget on the chin.  They have forced the Government to call an early election and they gave their assessment of the Government's budget and economic plans in the Donegal South West by-election.  They have given their assessment and they will give it again in the new year, when the people have their opportunity to do so.No one believes Deputy Michael Noonan will be a better or fairer Minister for Finance than the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  His actions as Minister for Health give the answer to that question.  Fine Gael subscribes to the same economic policies as the Government.  It is farcical for that party to make a judgment on the budget.  No one can understand why Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are still two separate parties.  They are joined at the hip, as is seen in their policies.It is clear that the Labour Party will accept and implement Fine Gael policies, because it has no alternative to offer.  Deputy Eamon Gilmore's personal ratings may still be high in the polls, but more and more people are beginning to see that the emperor has no clothes.The Government needs to go and the budget needs to be scrapped.  All parties need to give a commitment to introduce a budget after the general election to reverse these cuts.

I am advised that this Act envisaged that Dáil resolutions in respect of measures under that Act would be decided upon individually and that a serious question would arise as to the validity of a resolution which is done on a grouped basis.  I am further advised that the wrong statutory formula is used in a number of the resolutions but I am sure we can deal with this in the course of the debate.  My principal objection is that in effect what is being presented to the House is a book of resolutions which really amounts to a Finance Bill, having that significance in terms of the range of measures it proposes to deal with.  I do not object to having the measures grouped for the purposes of debate but it is not acceptable to the Labour Party that they would be voted upon on a group basis.  The voting of the measures on a group basis will arguably cause more votes than might be necessitated.  If we are voting on a grouped basis, we will be voting on groups some of whose measures we may be quite happy to agree with.  If there is one proposal in a group with which we are not in agreement, it will cause us to vote against it and thereby vote against the lot.  The view of the Labour Party is that we should debate the measures in groups but each of the 34 financial resolutions should be voted upon separately.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I agree with Deputy Gilmore's observations about the process.  This is an unprecedented situation where a total of 34 separate resolutions are being put to the House.  Not all of these resolutions come into effect as and from midnight.  Quite a number of the resolutions will not take effect until January.  Why, therefore, is the House being asked to group these resolutions now and to vote on them before midnight, when up to 40% of them do not come into effect until January of next year?  It is a normal procedure on budget night that the financial resolutions take effect from midnight this evening but not all of them take effect from that time.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the Opposition would agree with quite a number of measures.However, the fact that they are being grouped means there will be an omnibus vote on each of the groups and effectively the House will be unable to divide on each individual resolution.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	498	As the Ceann Comhairle has said, this is in accordance with precedence — perhaps not in more recent times, but when there were, thankfully, different types of budgets that were being considered, and we were talking about reducing rates and duties because of the surplus positions in our finances at the time.  There are precedents for this in the 1990s and earlier under successive Governments.  It is a means by which people can conduct the proceedings.  The question was asked as to when these become effective.  It is important that we give certainty on all these matters and that the House passes these financial resolutions tonight in respect of all these issues.  As regards when they come into effect, people need to know and plan, and cannot hang around.  One of the pillars of the argument coming from the Opposition was the need for certainty; this gives it certainty.We are providing for focused discussion on these resolutions, some of which are not controversial at all.  If, because of the grouping of the resolutions, there is one against which Deputy Gilmore wants to vote and not others, I would be in the Chair's hands as to whether he can take the one rather than the group — I am not sure that is available to him.  Under Standing Orders, if we were taking the group vote anyway, the Deputy could indicate that there were three with which he was happy, but was voting against in respect of a particular resolution and that would cover him.

Financial Resolution No. 4: Excise (Vehicle Registration Tax)
(1) THAT, as on and from 1 January 2011, section 132(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (No. 9 of 1992), be amended by substituting the following for paragraph (d):"(d) in case it is—(i) a category C vehicle, or(ii) a category N1 vehicle that, at the time of manufacture has less than 4 seats and has a technically permissible maximum laden mass that is greater than 130 per cent of the mass of the vehicle with bodywork in running order,at the rate of €50,".(2) IT is hereby certified that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).The taking together of Financial Resolutions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, was agreed by the House in the vote on the allocation of time motion.  Financial Resolution No. 1, relating to mineral oils, petrol and diesel, provides for an increase with effect from midnight tonight to the rates of mineral oil tax on petrol and auto diesel which, when VAT is included, amounts to 4 cent on a litre of petrol and 2 cent on a litre of auto diesel.  The rate of aviation gasoline, which is aligned to the petrol rate, and the rates for heavy oil use for non-commercial navigation and flying, which are aligned to the auto diesel rate, are increased accordingly.  The expected yield from these increases, inclusive of VAT, is approximately €106 million in a full year.  These measures will increase the consumer price index by approximately 0.13%.Compared to Northern Ireland the price of petrol was around 10 cent cheaper in the State and auto diesel around 20 cent cheaper.  While the increases being made tonight will narrow the differential, it will still remain significant.It should also be noted that the UK is due to increase its standard VAT rate by 2.5% from 17.5% to 20% with effect from 4 January 2011.  In addition, excise on petrol and auto diesel is due to increase by slightly under 1% from 1 January 2011.  The overall effect of these changes will be to increase the price of petrol and auto diesel in the UK and Northern Ireland by around 4 cent per litre in early 2011.Financial Resolution No. 2, relating to air travel tax, provides for the introduction, with effect from 1 March 2011, of a single rate of air travel tax of €3 per departing passenger on a temporary basis.This new rate of tax replaces the existing distance-related rates of €2 and €10.  People will recall that the €2 rate relates to trips of less than 300 miles and the €10 rate relates to those of more than 300 miles.  Some 97% of the tax has been in respect of the €10 rate.It is estimated this measure will cost the Exchequer approximately €56 million in taxation next year.  Ireland is not unique in applying a tax on air travel and a number of countries within the EU apply similar taxes, including the UK and France.  Going further afield, both Australia and New Zealand apply similar taxes.  The US has introduced a tourist tax on tourists travelling there by air and furthermore, Germany and Austria are currently in the process of introducing an air travel tax to apply from January next year.  The rates of tax applied by many of those countries are higher than Irish rates, and substantially so in some cases.  The trend in Europe is towards applying a tax on air travel.There have been calls to abolish the tax on the basis that it adversely affects the number of people travelling to Ireland.  I have difficulty in accepting that proposition and consider that the impact of the air travel tax is being overstated.  The numbers travelling appear to be more closely related to other factors, including the level of economic activity.Notwithstanding reservations, it has been decided that a single revised rate of air travel tax of €3 will come into effect on 1 March 2011.  Let me be clear that this is being applied on a temporary basis until the end of 2011 and the position will be reviewed next year; the rate will be increased unless there is clear and decisive evidence of an appropriate response from the airlines through increasing capacity and numbers travelling to Ireland by air.  As the Minister for Finance stated in his Budget Statement, in conjunction with this initiative the Dublin Airport Authority is prepared to introduce an incentive scheme for 2011 whereby it will provide, subject to certain conditions, a full rebate of airport charges for additional traffic delivered above a certain threshold based on 2010 passenger levels.  The DAA will provide further details of that scheme.Financial Resolution No. 3 regards the car scrappage scheme and the vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief for hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles.  This resolution amends sections 135(b) and 135(c) of the Finance Act 1992 to provide for an extension of the car scrappage scheme introduced in the 2010 budget until 30 June 2011, and to extend to 31 December 2012 the vehicle registration tax available with a lower threshold for certain hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles.The key features of the extended scrappage scheme include it taking effect from 1 January next and running to 30 June 2011.  Up to €1250 VRT relief will be provided and it is available against the VRT liability on the registration of new category A vehicles, or passenger vehicles, with a level of CO2 emissions of not more than 140 g/kg.  This takes in bands A and B in motor tax.  A passenger car over ten years old must be scrapped at an authorised treatment facility in the State and a certificate of destruction issued.The scrappage scheme introduced in last year's budget has been successful in contributing towards a large increase in new car sales in 2010, as they have increased 57% on the same period the previous year.  It has contributed to the maintenance of jobs in the motor industry.  Approximately 16,500 low-emission cars have been sold under the scheme up to the end of November, and the scheme is being extended to allow the industry to get the maximum benefit from its traditionally busiest period for new car sales in the first half of the year.The resolution also extends the VRT relief available against the purchase of series production hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles which is due to expire at the end of the December.  It is being extended for a further two years until 31 December 2012, with the maximum VRT relief available in that period of €1,500.  To the end of November 2010, approximately 3,000 flexible fuel and 1,200 hybrid vehicles have been purchased.Financial Resolution No. 4 addresses an unanticipated consequence of a provision introduced in the Finance Act 2010 which was to amend section 130 of the Finance Act 1992, whereby a small number of light commercial vehicles which would previously have been charged at the category C VRT rate of €50 will from 1 January 2011 without this amendment be charged the category B rate of 13.3% of the open market selling price.  In order to rectify this anomaly and ensure that these vehicles will continue to retain the low VRT rate, it is necessary to amend the charging provisions for category C vehicles to ensure that such light commercial vehicles remain within that category.The revised classification for vehicles introduced in the Finance Act 2010, with effect from 1 January 2011, was introduced as an anti-avoidance measure, as in some cases people were altering the specifications of vehicles; for example, extra body weight may have been added to the vehicle so as to change the classification and thereby considerably reducing the VRT liability.  Many such alterations are also seen to be a safety risk.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	512	It is unfortunate that we must debate four resolutions at the same time because we support some but disagree with others.  We must vote against all four as a result of the way this is structured.  On the mineral oil excise, I do not understand why the cost of fuel is not being increased by applying an increase in carbon tax..  Perhaps the Taoiseach will explain why this is so.  In the past number of budgets we have made a deliberate effort to introduce carbon taxation to Ireland to provide a cost for carbon and change the mindset towards carbon and its impact on the environment in terms of emissions.There is no extra carbon taxation in the budget but there are increases in excises, and I do not understand why we are pursuing an excise increase when we could have raised the same amount of money by applying an increase in carbon taxation on fuel and by continuing to pursue the carbon strategy, which has now stalled.  Perhaps I could get a response from one of the Government spokespersons on that issue.The measure relating to air travel tax is the reason we are voting against this grouping.  Fine Gael believes it is insane to charge people for the privilege of coming to Ireland on their holidays or on business while we are trying to stimulate activity in the Irish tourism sector.  We raised approximately €105 million this year by charging people €10 to leave this island and next year we will continue to charge them €10 until March, although we know the measure does not work and is reducing passenger numbers through Irish airports.  Even after this we will continue with the folly of charging people for the privilege of coming here while we spend considerable sums marketing Ireland abroad to get them here in the first place.  It is a disincentive to people coming through Irish airports if we charge for the privilege, although it is difficult to calculate exact figures.  Fine Gael has long made the case that we should abolish the air travel tax because it has not worked and is not working.  The damage being done in terms of the tourist industry and visitor numbers to Ireland far outweighs the revenue stream provided for the Government.The Taoiseach mentioned the incentive which the Dublin Airport Authority announced today, which is also flawed.  If passenger numbers travelling through Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports next year go above a value of €23.5 million, the DAA will give a rebate to the effect of what it would have cost those extra passengers to travel through Irish airports.  This will go to all the airlines, depending on the percentage of passengers attributable to different airlines.  In other words they are not incentivising airlines to increase passenger numbers because even if that does not happen, an airline will get the benefit.  If, for example, Ryanair provides extra passengers to get us past the €23.5 million value, all the airlines will get the benefit rather than the airline which provided the extra passengers.  That makes no sense.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I will focus on two aspects of this group of proposals.  Like the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party proposed the abolition of the air travel tax.  While I acknowledge that the Government has made a move in that direction by reducing the tax and has applied some conditionality to its application, this is one of the taxes, the disincentive effect of which is as much the fact that it is in place as it is the level at which it applies.  While I understand that when the budget was being framed and calculations were being made, the Minister examined the amount and arrived at the proposal before us, in terms of its impact on passenger numbers and tourism leaving the tax in place means there is still a difficulty.If the Government was moving in the direction of increasing excise on petrol and diesel, I, like Deputy Coveney, do not understand the reason this was not done by way of the carbon tax or carbon levy.  This would have had a more general application than the use of the excise method.  While I expected the budget to include an excise package — it is an understandable measure — I am puzzled as to the reason the excise measure is focused on petrol.  Why, for example, was the Irish Cancer Society's recommendation on excise on cigarettes not taken up?  Why were the various recommendations to increase excise on alcohol for health reasons not taken up?  There were expectations and a certain amount of speculation that the budget would include increases on excise in these areas.Increasing excise on petrol and diesel affects the one area where costs have increased significantly in recent times.  Even in recent days, the price of petrol and diesel has increased on the forecourt.  Such increases impact directly on working people.  The cost of travelling to work, doing business or running a van or vehicle associated with work will increase as a result of this measure.  The proposal is misplaced.  If excise was to be increased, other options were available.  If the Government wanted to focus on carbon, it should have increased the carbon levy.

It is incredible that the Government has made this choice.  There is no question that this is a further tax on work and business.  When one considers that those fortunate enough to have work must travel ever greater distances to access their employment one realises the net impact of what is involved here.  People no longer use their cars for social purposes.  The bulk of car use is directly related to accessing employment or the furtherance of specific business pursuits.  The level of car use for social activities and such like is limited.The proposition will have a hugely detrimental impact in the Border counties where we already have evidence of retail petrol and diesel outlets closing or significantly curtailing their business throughput because of the exodus north of the Border across a variety of attractions.  We are putting another nail in the coffin of business outlets throughout the Border region, from Donegal through Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan to Louth and for a significant distance beyond these counties.  That is one of the most certain outworkings of what is proposed.  The measure is anti-business and anti-employment and the Government has again made a very bad choice.On the air travel tax, while the reduction from €10 to €3 is welcome, the abolition of the tax would have had a much more imaginative impact in terms of the tourism sector and tourism market overseas.  For the sake of €3, the Government could have gone the whole hog and had a major impact on the consciousness of tourism providers and organisers globally in terms of Ireland as a more keen destination for tourist traffic.  A golden opportunity was lost by applying the brake in reducing the tax from €10 to €3.  The Government should have gone the whole way and abolished the tax.  This would have given a valuable fillip to the tourism industry, one of the most important sectors in terms of having any prospect of rejuvenated economic activity over the short time ahead.

While there is no hard evidence to show this measure will result in an increase in the number of visitors to the country, there is, nevertheless, a perception that this is the case.  The air travel tax, allied to airport charges, has been advocated by the chief executive of Ryanair as one of the principal reasons we are unable to attract the number of visitors we should attract.  It is also cited as a reason Mr. O'Leary and his company should abandon PSOs.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating and it is now a matter for Mr. O'Leary, Ryanair and other low charge airlines to establish the fruit of their words by increasing the number of visitors coming to Ireland in response to these changes.I was interested in Deputy Ó Caoláin's intervention.  The old Sinn Féin philosophy of "only our rivers run free" has been extended to having our petrol and diesel and even our drink run free.

Deputy Flynn is one of our brightest young Deputies.  Then again, coming from one of the few Cork men I know who does not know the difference between a pint of Guinness and a pint of Murphy's, his comment does not come as a surprise.

The Government has been selective in referring to countries which apply a similar tax.  The Netherlands, for example, which has one of the busiest airports in Europe, Schiphol, abandoned its travel tax last year.  It is one of the busiest airports around.  There was a golden opportunity here but it has been missed.  It is a sad reflection of how the Government——

Advocating further increases on other fuels would not be a very sensible way to go and that is why we are not taking the carbon tax route on this issue.We will see an increase in VAT rates from the British Exchequer.  This is to keep the differential.  What we are doing is presaging a change that is happening in the United Kingdom.  Deputies will know that the price of diesel and petrol at filling stations is much less on the Republic side of the Border.  I do not know what way it is with other operations.It is important that we ensure this measure for the DAA where there is an increase in overall numbers.  As an airport authority, it is entitled to incentivise airlines and has often done so.

This is about increasing numbers.  We must find a public-private arrangement that will help taxpayers generally by bringing more tourists to the country, perhaps even sending them down to parts of the county from where the Deputy comes.  If we are to do that we must provide some incentivisation.  The European Union is opposed to different rates or amounts being charged for different journeys.  We can bring this to a uniform rate, to €3.Deputy Flynn raised a very important question which needs to be addressed in the Finance Bill, namely, that we ensure airports that are not within the DAA remit but which have services available to the UK and elsewhere and would have attracted the higher rate heretofore are not disadvantaged as they seek to innovate and prosper.

Financial Resolution No. 9: Income Tax
(1) THAT, as respects any payment to which section 123 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (No. 39 of 1997) applies (in this Resolution referred to as the "lump sum") made on or after 1 January 2011—(a) notwithstanding the provisions of section 201 of, and Schedule 3 to, that Act, income tax shall be charged by virtue of section 123 of that Act on the amount of the lump sum which exceeds the lesser of either—(i) that part of the lump sum which, apart from this Resolution, would be exempt from income tax by virtue of section 201 of, and Schedule 3 to, that Act, including any deduction in computing the charge to income tax under paragraph 6 of that Schedule, and(ii) €200,000,(b) the amount of €200,000 referred to in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate amounts exempted from income tax, including any deduction in computing the charge to income tax under paragraph 6 of Schedule 3 to that Act, in respect of all payments to which section 123 of that Act applied which were paid before or at the same time as the payment of the lump sum,(c) the amount determined in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be determined without regard to subsections (1A) and (2) of section 201 of that Act, and(d) where 2 or more payments in respect of which tax is chargeable by virtue of section 123 of that Act are made to or in respect of the same person in respect of the same office or employment, or in respect of different offices or employments, for the purposes of this Resolution this paragraph shall apply as if those payments were a single payment of an amount equal to that aggregate amount and the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall apply to that amount accordingly.(2) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).I propose to speak on Financial Resolutions Nos. 5 to 8 together as they relate to pensions and on Financial Resolution No. 9, which concerns a related area, the taxation of tax-free termination lump sums.  Against the very difficult and challenging budgetary situation facing this country, and as outlined in the national recovery plan, the tax base must be broadened and tax expenditure must be curtailed or abolished.  Given the continuing very significant costs of pensions tax reliefs, such reliefs cannot escape attention in that regard.  The national recovery plan specifically mentioned a number of the pension-related changes the Government has committed to making, in 2011 and over the three remaining periods of the plan.  The changes announced in the Budget Statement today deliver on the commitment as regards 2011.Apart from contributing to curbing the overall tax expenditure, these changes will bring further equity to the system by impacting, for the most part, on higher earners.  Deputies will recall that the Commission on Taxation recommended that a pension lump sum taken on retirement should be tax free up to €200,000 and taxed at the standard rate of income tax on any balance above that amount.  The commission also recommended that the correlation between the maximum tax relieved pension fund that can be built up by an individual, known as the standard fund threshold, and the annual earnings limit for pension contribution purposes should be maintained.  This correlation has been broken in recent years as the earning limits fell from €275,000 in 2008 to €150,000 in 2009, with no corresponding contraction in the standard fund threshold.  The commission recommended that ex gratia termination lump sums should also be tax free up to €200,000 and that any amount in excess of this should be taxed.As flagged in the national recovery plan and as specified in the budget speech today, it has been decided to act on the commission's recommendations.  A further reduction in the earning limits for pension contribution purposes is being made and the rate at which the national distribution for approved retirement funds is to be calculated is to be increased.  The elimination of employee PRSI and pension contributions in 2011 and the changes to employer PRSI relief on employee pension contributions, which were announced today, will be dealt with in the context of legislation with which my colleague the Minister for Social Protection will deal.  The Financial Resolutions before us give legislative effect, therefore, to the following budget measures pending the passing into law of the finance Bill of 2011.Financial Resolution No. 5 provides for the reduction in the earnings limit which, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits, governs the maximum amount of tax relieved contributions an individual can make in any one year to pension products.  The limit is being reduced from €150,000 in the current year to €115,000 for 2011.  Deputies may be aware that the pension tax legislation provides for an individual who pays a pension contribution after the end of a tax year but on or before the return filing date for that tax year to elect to have the contribution treated as if paid in the earlier year.  Clearly, with the reduction of the earning limits for 2011, individuals may well be tempted to retrospectively maximise their tax relief for 2010 where they have not done so already by allocating contributions made next year to 2010.  This would give rise to significant tax refunds in 2011 that we simply cannot afford.  Accordingly, the resolution seeks to limit such exposure by deeming the earning limits for this year to be €115,000 as well for the purpose of such elections.Financial Resolution No. 6 provides for the reduction from €5.4 million to €2.3 million, with effect from today, in the limit on the maximum tax relieved pension fund that can be built up by an individual.  This is known as the standard fund threshold.  Individuals with pension rights in excess of this new lower standard fund threshold on budget day will be able to protect the capital value of those rights by claiming a personal fund threshold.  Such transitional measures were also recommended by the Commission on Taxation to deal with circumstances where an individual's pension rights had already exceeded any revised lower limit.  The legal advice to the Government was to the effect that the absence of such grandfathering arrangements, which also applied when the standard fund thresholds were first introduced on 7 December 2005, would be difficult to defend against constitutional and legal challenges.  The personal fund threshold will be calculated on the aggregate of the capital value of pension benefits to which the individual has already become entitled since 7 December 2005 plus the capital value on budget day of any uncrystallised pension rights that the individual has — in other words, pension rights that the individual is building up but to which he has not yet become entitled.  Where this amount exceeds the standard fund threshold of €2.3 million, that higher amount will be the individual's personal fund threshold.However, that is subject to not exceeding the existing standard fund threshold of €5.4 million which would have been the maximum tax relief pension fund such individuals would have been able to build up before today.  As before, a personal fund threshold will have to be claimed from the Revenue Commissioners by way of a notification and certification procedure.  An individual who already has a personal fund threshold under the old regime will be able to retain it.The resolution also ensures that the standard capitalisation factor for use in determining the value of defined benefit pension rights, for the purposes of estimating an individual's personal fund threshold and for the purposes of valuing pension rights when eventually drawn down, is to be 20 as before.Financial Resolution No. 7 provides for an increase in the annual notional distribution for approved retirement funds which is calculated on the value of assets in an approved retirement fund as of 31 December each year.  The amount of the notional distribution will be 5% of the value as compared to 3% as currently provided for.  This new rate will apply to asset values at 31 December 2010.Financial Resolution No. 8 provides for the taxation of pension lump sums above €200,000 with effect from 1 January next year.  This resolution replaces the existing provision in the Taxes Consolidation Act of 1997 which already places a lifetime limit on the amount of tax free pension lump sum that can be taken by an individual from 7 December 2005.  This limit was set at 25% of the old standard fund threshold and amounts to €1.3 million.Under the new approach the maximum lifetime pension tax free sum will be €200,000 as from 1 January 2011.  Amounts in excess of this tax free limit will be subject to tax in two stages.  The portion between €200,000 and €575,000 will be taxed at the standard rate of 20% while any portion above that will be taxed at the individual's marginal rate of tax.  The figure of €575,000 represents 25% of the new lower standard fund threshold of €2.3 million mentioned earlier and retains the link to the old approach.  The standard rate charges effectively ring-fence to ensure that no reliefs, allowances or deductions may be set or made against that portion of a lump sum subject to that charge.It should be appreciated that tax free retirement lump sums taken on or after 7 December 2005 when the original limit was introduced will count towards using up the new tax free amount.  In other words, if an individual has already taken tax free retirement lump sums of €200,000 or more since 7 December 2005, any further retirement lump sum paid to the individual on or after 1 January 2011 will be taxable.  There is no question of those individuals somehow getting an additional tax free amount.  These earlier lump sums will also count towards determining how much of a lump sum paid on or after 1 January 2011 is to be charged at the standard or marginal rate as appropriate.It is also important to note that this is a lifetime limit and therefore it will apply to a single lump sum or where an individual is in receipt of lump sums from more than one pension product to the aggregate of those lump sums.  The restriction applies to all pension arrangements including occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts, PRSAs, public sector and statutory schemes.  As before, there are certain exclusions from the pension lump sum tax charge.  It will not apply, for example, to lump sum death-in-service benefits paid to widows.Resolution No. 9 sets out the basis for the imposition of a lifetime limit on exempt ex gratia lump sum payments made primarily in respect of termination of employment as recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  With effect from 1 January 2011, where an individual is in receipt of an ex gratia payment from their employer the aggregate amount which can be paid tax free will be €200,000, taking into consideration the tax free elements of any previous payment that individual had received.  This restriction will have no relevance to the majority of employees.  Its impact will primarily be confined to those in receipt of large ex gratia payments.  I commend the resolutions to the House.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	570	I again register our objection to taking four or five resolutions together.  It is not necessary to do that and it means that when we are in a position to agree on something with the Government, as with some of these, we cannot vote for it because we do not agree with lumping the resolutions together.We have a serious problem with Resolution No. 5, which I will address, but I want to first comment on Resolutions Nos. 8 and 9.  While the tax changes to the lump sum are welcome, most people have a problem with the lump sum itself, especially when they see the figures being paid out to retiring Ministers and various top civil servants.  That is something not addressed in this budget bar through the tax system.  The wrong message is going out on that but that is a separate discussion we can have during the debate on the entire budget.  People become very annoyed when they see those lump sums being paid out at a time when they are struggling.As a party we have a concern with Resolution No. 5.  We proposed many changes to the pensions area in our alternative budget published last Friday.  Some of them are very good but we tried to tackle the overall pension fund in a different way to individual people contributing into it.  My concern is that this measure limits the amount of money a person can put into his or her pension fund in certain years.  Fine Gael's proposal was to allow a person accumulate a fund that will give him or her an annual maximum pension of approximately €60,000 a year.  We would discourage above that figure but we said we would facilitate a person accumulating enough of a fund to have a pension of €60,000 a year.  That means that if a person is late starting to contribute to a fund he or she might not get a chance to accumulate enough money for that payment.  The Government is preventing that.In the current climate it is quite common for self-employed people to stop paying into their pension fund for several years because they just cannot make the contributions.  They cannot even pay a wage, other than cashing in other investments and so on to survive.  In a few years time when Fine Gael is in government, the country has recovered and those in self-employment have a chance to earn more money, they will be discouraged from putting money into their pension fund to pay out a pension to which they are entitled based on their years of work.  This measure is unfair in that regard.  It is penalising the wrong person.The Government must realise the times in which we now live.  Not everybody in business made money in the good times but certainly in recent years many people in business could not pay into their pension fund.  They should be allowed to pay extra in years to come but they will not be able to do that because this measure will restrict them in that it will not be worth their while.  It is a pity the Minister has lumped these resolutions together because we will oppose this one.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	571	I welcome the fact that finally the Government has recognised a need to do something on the pensions front.  For years it has been in denial about the fact that our pensions system was more about facilitating tax avoidance than encouraging pension provision.  The way in which it operates, as the Minister and her officials will be aware, has been inequitable.  That is the reality.  A total of €3 billion has been spent per year on tax relief on pensions and the vast bulk of that has gone to the top 20% of earners.Side by side with that outrage, as I would regard it, almost 50% of workers do not have any private pension provision and therefore as a policy it was ineffective while the manner in which it operated was inequitable.  I welcome these first steps in implementing reform in this area, but overall the Minister is not going anywhere near far enough.The Labour Party, in its pension proposals, has estimated that it would be possible to save a minimum of €400 million in the coming year, and possibly up to €600 million, if there was a proper root and branch reform of the pensions tax relief system.  That could be done in a way that would not impact on people with incomes of up to €100,000.  We could ensure that there was still a major incentive for people on middle and modest incomes to make pension provision but, unfortunately, the Government has chosen to take a different route.I find it extraordinary that in each of these five measures the Minister has a costing and a figure for each one of those.  The Labour Party is extremely concerned that we have spent the past three years trying to get costings from the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners for different aspects of our pension provision and on every single occasion we have been refused and told that no figures were available.  The reply to my last parliamentary question a few weeks ago denied that figures were available anywhere.  I was told the Department was now approaching the pensions industry to try to get some estimates.The Minister was not in a position to provide figures to the Labour Party in spite of the fact that a service was offered that she would cost our pre-budget proposals, and today she could come up with figures for each one of those measures.  How did that come about?  If she was unable to provide those figures last week and was unable to provide them over the past three years when we have been asking for them, can we believe these figures now?  Are they accurate and how is it that the Government can just come up with them suddenly?In respect of the individual proposals, we will not oppose the annual earnings limit but it could have been done in a much better way.  We should take our example from what is happening in the UK where a cap is being introduced on the total amount of tax relief that can be claimed, whether the contribution is made by the employee or the employer.  That is the weakness in these proposals and in the proposals signalled in the four year plan.  All the Minister is talking about doing is limiting the employee contributions.  The really big money, as the Minister well knows, is in the employer contributions and it makes no sense to exclude those from any new limits.  Let us stop codding ourselves on what is happening in the pensions area.  Why does the Government continue to facilitate persons in jobs where their employers can fund their pensions generously and what is the rationale for not applying the same kind of limits to employer contributions as employee contributions?On Financial Resolution No. 6, the maximum allowable pension funds, the Minister proposes to reduce the maximum standard fund threshold from the current €5.4 million to €2.3 million.  It is a move in the right direction, but why has the Minister not gone further?  A fund of €2.3 million will entitle a person to a pension of €100,000.  I see no justification for taxpayers subsidising pensions for persons who end up with a pension of €100,000 at a time when the Minister introduced the universal social charge, which will impose additional taxes on persons on modest pensions.  Pensioners with an income of under €40,000 will now be hit for an additional €2,000 through the universal charge and through the tax changes, and yet the Minister is saying it is acceptable that somebody would be subsidised to the tune of the top rate of tax relief to enable him or her to have a pension of €100,000.  There is no justification or rationale for that.  The Labour Party favours reducing the total fund to €1.6 million.Financial Resolution No. 7 is a reasonable proposal and we do not have a difficulty with that.  On Financial Resolutions Nos. 8 and 9 on the retirement lump sum, my party agrees with reducing the lump sum.  The current lump sum of €1.3 million, that the wealthiest in society are entitled to take without paying a single cent of tax, is indefensible.  It is an outrageous amount of money.  There is no justification, socially or economically, for having such a regime.  It is about time that lump sum was lowered.  In recent years when we have had to take such austerity measures and when there is such hardship being caused to persons on low incomes, how can the Minister defend a situation where the wealthiest are walking off with €1.3 million tax free on retirement?  It is scandalous that it was ever the case and it is scandalous that the Minister has allowed it to continue up to now.I welcome the fact that the Minister is talking about now reducing that maximum tax-free lump sum to €200,000.  I still think it is too high.  It should come down below €150,000.  That would be reasonable still.I refer to the Minister's proposals for the transitional arrangements for persons who currently have funds in excess of the new threshold being proposed where he is allowing them to take a tax-free lump sum.  He is changing this tonight — we are voting on it shortly — but the Minister will still continue to allow persons who have bigger funds to withdraw tax-free lump sums of €575,000.  There is no justification——

We propose its reduction to €100,000.  I note the Minister has provided for €115,000 here.  We also propose standardising pension tax reliefs, which, unfortunately, is not in this document.On Financial Resolution No. 6, the Minister is allowing for a maximum pension fund on retirement for tax purposes to be set a €2.3 million.  I suppose €2.3 million is not bad, really, when one measures it against the Minister's expectation that somebody can survive on €186 per week on jobseeker's allowance.  Given the evidence, I remain to be convinced on a fair society.On the retirement lump sums cap of €200,000, I note that has come down substantially in recent years.  Not that long ago it was €500,000.  There has been a significant move here but, in fairness, it should have been lower.

The overarching message from these measures is that those who have acquired and who would prefer to acquire larger lump sums tax-free will not do so.  We are now setting a threshold of €200,000.

any income levy (within the meaning of section 531A of the Principal Act), in relation to an employee, remains unpaid for the tax year 2009 or 2010 and is not otherwise recovered (in this subparagraph

applies, as making a payment of relevant emoluments (within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this Resolution) to the employee in the tax year 2011 of an amount equal to the amount referred to in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph (in this paragraph referred to as “notional emoluments”),(b) the amount of the notional emoluments shall be an amount which would produce an amount of universal

highest portion of the employee’s relevant emoluments (within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this Resolution) for that week or other period.(14) THAT, where any income levy (within the meaning of section 531A of the Principal Act) or universal social charge, as the case may be, remains unpaid after the end of a tax year, the amount of tax credits (within the meaning of the PAYE Regulations) and the standard rate cut-off point (within that meaning) appropriate to an employee for any subsequent tax year may be adjusted as necessary by an inspector of taxes or other officer of the Revenue Commissioners to collect unpaid universal social charge or income levy which is not otherwise recovered.(15) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act (No. 7 of 1927).
Financial Resolution No. 14: Income Levy
(1) THAT the tax known as income levy imposed by section 531B (inserted by section 2 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008) (No. 25 of 2008) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (No. 39 of 1997) shall cease to be charged with effect as on and from 1 January 2011.(2) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act (No. 7 of 1927).In 2010 it is estimated that almost 45% of income tax earners will be exempt from income tax and only 14% will pay income tax at the higher rate.  For a single individual, the entry point to income tax is €18,300.  A married, one income family does not start paying income tax until income levels are in excess of €31,950.  It is evident that this situation has become unsustainable.  We arrived at this situation by the very generous increases in credits and bands over several years.  The combined value of the personal tax credit and the PAYE tax credit has increased by 92% since 2001, from €1,905 to €3,600 in 2010.  The single standard rate band has increased from €17,780 in 1999 to €36,400 in 2010.  This is an increase of 105%.It is clear that we cannot afford such generous tax reliefs on income.  In this budget, therefore, we have reduced the personal and PAYE tax credits by approximately 10% to €1,650 each from €1,830.  We have reduced the single standard rate band to €32,800 from a value of €36,400.  The married one income band has been reduced to €41,800 from €45,400 and the married two earner band has been reduced to €65,600 from €72,800.  These measures will reduce the entry point to income tax for a single individual to €16,500 and for a married one income family to €28,800.  These measures will return tax credits and bands to where they were in 2006.  As a result of these measures, the numbers exempt from income tax in 2011 will be reduced to 38% from 45%.  The numbers exempt will be reduced to 843,400 from the 2010 figure of 982,900 — a reduction of almost 140,000.Most important of all in these difficult times, it is estimated these measures will raise €830 million in 2011 and €1.1 billion in a full year.  We will also reduce the age exemption limits from €20,000 for a single person and €40,000 for a married couple to €18,000 and €36,000, respectively.  It is not unreasonable in these difficult times to reduce the entry point to tax for a married couple aged under 65 years with no children to €24,750 but maintain the entry point to tax at €40,000 for a couple over 65 years.A new universal social charge is being introduced to replace the income levy and the health levy.  The universal charge will be applied at a rate of 2% up to €10,036, 4% above that amount but below €16,016 and 7% above €16,016.  A lower exemption threshold of €4,004 will apply.  Income earners over 70 years of age will not be liable for the higher rate of 7%.  As with the levy, payments made by the Department of Social Protection will be exempt from the universal social charge.  The charge is more equitable and has a wider base and lower rate when compared with the combined income levy and health levy.  It is designed to apply across income levels in a smoother progression while addressing the irregularities caused by the step effects in the current system of levies and PRSI.  The current combination of income levy, health levy and PRSI creates a number of anomalies due to the entry point steps to each of these charges.  The health levy has a step of 4% to €26,000, which results in an anomaly whereby an individual earning €25,500 per annum can receive an increase in income of €1,000 but only €320 in net pay.  The introduction of the universal charge will resolve this issue.  An individual on €25,500 who receives an increase of €1,000 will now be €690 better off.  The charge is the first step in removing the irregularities due to the combination of levies and PRSI in the current system.  The charge is revenue neutral in 2011 and will yield €420 million in a full year.Financial Resolution No. 10 reduces the level of the standard bands.  The single standard band is reduced from €36,400 to €32,800.  Financial Resolution No. 11 reduces the level of income tax credits by approximately 10%.  Personal PAYE credits will be reduced from €1,830 to €1,650.  Financial Resolution No. 12 reduces the threshold for the exemption limit for persons aged 65 or older to €18,000 for a single or widowed person and €36,000 for a married couple where either spouse is aged over 65 years.  Financial Resolution No. 13 gives statutory effect to the budgetary announcement that a new charge called the universal social charge will be introduced on 1 January 2011.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The Government got it completely wrong in this case.  We oppose this group of Financial Resolutions because they will hit low and middle income earners.  The imposition of income tax as proposed by the Government will destroy the traditionally low level of tax levied on the wedge between the employer's bill and the take home pay of the employee.  The Government is going to force down the standard of living for those on low and middle incomes.Fine Gael proposed not to increase income taxes in 2011 and we demonstrated this could be done by making savings of €250 million through 6,000 further redundancies in back office and administration throughout the public sector.  There are further alternatives for making savings, such as greater cost reductions and further changes to the public service.Under this imposition, a single person on the minimum wage will be worse off by €879 annually or €17 per week.  If one takes account of the changes made in respect of income tax and the universal charge, such an individual will lose twice as much as if he or she was on welfare.  This is a savage imposition on the lowest earners.  It is not the kind of progression we need and, from that point of view, must be rejected.According to the figures outlined in the budget, the income tax that is now to be imposed means a couple with three children and a single gross income of €50,000 will be worse off by €1,800.  Such a family would be better off by €1,600 under the alternative plan proposed by Fine Gael, which makes it clear that it is not necessary to increase income tax in 2011.The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, was previously an advocate of streamlining income tax and reducing the tax burden.  She will be aware, therefore, that these proposals are short-sighted, lack ambition and will force down the living standards of people on low and middle incomes.  They contain a series of landmines which were never acknowledged by the Minister for Finance.  They are appallingly short-sighted and retrograde and, for these reasons, I oppose them resolutely.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I wish to ask the Minister some questions about the universal social charge, which represents a significant change to our tax code.  In effect, people will be charged for what they commonly understand as social provisions.  I acknowledge that the PRSI rate of 4% is not being touched for most people but the universal charge is described in paragraph 2 of Financial Resolution No. 13 as a tax.  It replaces the old health contribution and the levies that have applied since the advent of the financial emergency.  As a tax, it will go into the general pool of taxation, whereas its name gives people to understand that it will be dedicated to social provision, including the areas of health and children.The current health contribution is charged at a rate of 4% on income up to €75,000 but employees earning up to €500 per week, or €26,000 per year, are exempt.  Under the new system, everyone with an income over €4,000 will be subject to the universal social charge at a higher rate.  The rate of the levies in 2010 for an individual earning less than €75,000 was 2%.  The universal social charge comes in at a very low level and individuals who earn more than €4,000 must pay the levy on their entire income.The levy is reduced slightly for those who are aged 70 years and older.  Every Deputy will be aware that medical card holders, including those who are aged 70 years or older, were exempt from the health contribution.  I would be delighted to hear that the small print provides for this.There are eight pages of text dealing with this levy, but I cannot find where it says that people in receipt of a medical card or who are over 70 are exempt from this new universal social charge.  It is called a charge because it is general taxation and breaches the contributory principle that is at the heart of the social welfare contributory system, which is that one contributes when one works and receives entitlements in one's old age.  I am surprised that Fianna Fáil opted for this measure.  Perhaps it is a Progressive Democrat or a Green Party idea.  I am surprised at the severity with which this measure is set out.Can the Minister tell me I am wrong about medical card holders?  As we all know, getting a medical card at present is pretty tough.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	598	In the Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance gave us information I had heard a month ago when I was in the Department of Finance with my colleagues.  The Minister said those earning more than €75,000 represent approximately 8% of all income tax payers and those 8% of taxpayers pay 60% of all income tax.  Following the changes to income tax rates, how is that figure likely to change?Second, Deputy Burton has made an important point.  It is my understanding that the social insurance fund works on the basis that an individual makes a pay related social insurance, PRSI, contribution and that contribution goes into the social insurance fund.  This is not a finance measure; it is a social welfare measure.  In good times we take money from the social insurance fund and in bad times we supplement it.  What will now happen to the social insurance fund?  Will it remain in place?  With the abolition of the two levies, will the new charge go into that pot of money?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13880	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The Minister for Finance said those earning the new reduced minimum wage would not be brought into the tax net.  I seek clarification in this regard.  Financial Resolution No. 12 states:That, with effect from 1 January 2011, there shall be charged, levied and paid, in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution, a tax to be known as "universal social charge".This is an acknowledgment that the universal social charge is a tax.What is the situation in respect of the minimum wage?  The charge will not be levied on incomes up to €4,000, at 2% on incomes up to €10,036 and at 4% on the next €5,980.  There needs to be further clarification of the position of people who are earning the minimum wage.  The Labour Party interpretation is that this charge is a tax to be levied on those in receipt of the new reduced minimum wage.  If that is the case, it is grossly unfair.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The Minister described these measures as more equitable.  This is completely wrong because low income earners will be paying a substantially higher proportion of their incomes than high income earners.  That is grossly unfair.  The Government could have introduced a wealth tax but it chose not to do so.The universal social charge is not a social charge.  It is a tax, and that is the end of it.  A person earning the minimum wage has already been tapped for €40 per week.  The Government now proposes to go back to the economic carcass of that person for a further €360 per annum.  Can the Minister for Health and Children confirm that people on the new minimum wage will have to pay a charge of €360 per annum under this so-called social charge?  This is far from fair or equitable.I welcome the abolition of the income and health levies, which were unfair.  However, they did, at least, contain some element of relativity in that they captured higher income individuals.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	601	What has been done with regard to tax credits is appalling.  They have been cut by 10%, as the Minister for Health and Children has outlined.  This is more than the percentage cut to ministerial pensions.  A tax credit applied to carers, who save the taxpayer an average of €40,000 per year.  We are not giving them basic recognition in the taxation system.  Given the anomalies in the respite care grant, the tax credit is the only recognition some carers receive.  That recognition is now being reduced by the proposal before us.People with a disability and those who are visually impaired incur additional costs in going to work, and have a low rate of employment in any event.  The visually impaired have additional costs in making adaptations to allow them to live independently or to get to and from work.  It does not make sense to penalise the small number of people who avail of this tax credit, which will be the effect of the proposed measures.The lowest cut of all is the reduction in the tax credit for a widowed person in the year of assessment.  In the year when a person loses his or her spouse, we are cutting their tax relief by 10%, which is greater than the cut to the pensions of Ministers who will be leaving Government in a few months' time.I ask the Minister for Health and Children to justify these measures and explain why she, if she decides to retire, should be entitled to less of a cut than a widowed person in the year he or she becomes widowed.  This is unacceptable, as is the cut in tax relief to someone looking after an incapacitated child.  Some 64% of children with a disability must remain at home, saving the taxpayers €70,000 per year.

It was accepted on the basis that it would be dispensed with at some point.  We are being asked to facilitate a con trick.  We are being asked to pretend we are doing something that will give services to the public.  We are about to concrete the income and health levies forever.I can see an argument for breaking up the PRSI fund among the various health, pension and social welfare entitlements.  That would have made sense to me.  However, this universal social charge is an absolute con trick.  I sincerely hope the public will see through it.  How can the Minister for Health and Children stand over this income levy being consolidated into our tax code on an ongoing basis?

The Minister for Health and Children says the charge is revenue neutral.  Will the tax be progressive or will the lower paid be charged a greater percentage of their incomes than higher earners?The Minister says all taxpayers will suffer an equal hit.  However, people earning approximately €16,000 will be coming into the tax net for the first time since 2006.  They will also be liable for the universal social charge.  How will revenue from the charge be used?  The health levy was originally introduced for health use but I am not certain it was ever used for that purpose.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I agree that this is a complete con.  It is a new tax.  We have been given all kinds of assurances about people on minimum wages not being included in the tax net.  They are not in the income tax net but they are caught in the net with this charge.  This charge started as a universal social contribution with an element of contributing and getting something back but this recently changed to a charge.  It is a new tax, a new way of squeezing money out of people.  It is shifting the burden of taxation from the better-off to low income people. This is the whole purpose of this charge and the Government should be honest about this purpose.A number of points of clarification are required.  Will the current exemptions applying to the health and the income levies apply to the universal charge?  How will it interact with family income supplement?  This charge kicks in for low income people at the level of €4,000.  It is designed to bring people with incomes in the region of €4,000 into the tax net and it is fundamentally unfair.  Pensioners are now going to be caught with the combination of this universal charge and the lowering of the age exemption, so that a pensioner couple, with an income of just under €40,000 will be caught for an additional tax of €2,000 a year as a result of this measure.  This is about hammering people on low and modest incomes and nothing else.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I refer to people on very low incomes being taxed because that is what this charge does.  To continue the point made by Deputy Barrett, what are the benefits of this tax?  We all know that PRSI, pay-related social insurance, provided certain benefits which were available when needed but where are the benefits of this charge?  Who decided on the different categories?  It was always accepted that certain groups with particular needs were exempted.  However, it now seems there are two categories of people with regard to social welfare, the old-age pensioners — who, in this weather, would begrudge them the couple of bob they receive — and all the others.  I could never understand how widows under 66 years and left with young families through no fault of their own and on a meagre income, have not been given the household package.A friend of mine asked me to raise this question.  I refer to those employed before 1995 and post-1995 in the public sector and to whom different rates of PRSI apply.  The people employed after 1995 were given an increase in their salary because it was recognised they were paying a higher contribution.  Will all of those people be caught for the one charge if they earn €75,000?

The percentage change of net income is 5.3%, whereas for a person on €175,000 gross annual income it is as little as 0.9%.  I find it very difficult to understand how the Minister could stand up earlier and inform the House that this is an equitable or fair budget, because it clearly targets low paid workers and there is no incentive for them to work on that basis.

Financial Resolution No. 18: Capital Acquisitions Tax
(1) THAT, as respects a gift or an inheritance taken on or after 8 December 2010, the definition of "group threshold" in paragraph 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 (No. 1 of 2003) be amended—(a)   in subparagraph (a) by substituting “€244,000” for  “€304,775”,(b)   in subparagraph (b) by substituting “€24,400” for “€30,478”,and(c)   in subparagraph (c) by substituting “€12,200” for  “€15,239”.(2) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).These financial resolutions set out measures which build upon previous budget measures in broadening the tax base and form part of a move away from taxes on labour and consumption to wealth and sources of wealth.  Financial Resolution No. 15 provides for a major reform of the change to stamp duty on transactions of residential property.  The change involves simplification of the system by lowering the rates of stamp duty and abolishing a number of exemptions and reliefs.  The stamp duty reforms, as announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget, have two aims — stimulation of the property market and commencing the necessary infrastructure for the commitment in the national recovery plan for a site valuation tax.A new 1% rate is being introduced for all transactions of residential property valued up to €1 million.  This represents a significant reduction from the current rate of 7% for amounts between €125,000 and €1 million.    A new rate of 2% will apply to amounts above €1 million, replacing the current rate of 9% for these properties.The changes in rates will act as an important stimulation to the property market by removing uncertainty and will have a positive knock-on effect on connected activities leading to increased revenue for the Exchequer.  It will also significantly reduce the cost of house purchase for persons seeking to move home or purchase their first home.  For example, the stamp duty on a property valued at €200,000 is €5,250 at the current rate and this will fall to €2,000, representing a saving of €3,250, or 62%.  Similarly, a house valued at €300,000 will now be charged at €3,000 instead of €12,250.In line with the base-broadening measures in this budget and to pay for the new rates, the Minister will abolish all existing reliefs and exemption stamp duty on residential property including first-time buyer's relief, relief from stamp duty on new houses under 125 sq. m, reduced stamp duty on new houses over 125 sq. m, relief in respect of residential property transfer and exemption for residential property valued under €127,000.In addition, he is abolishing the site to child relief from stamp duty, which is the relief applying to transfers of site from a parent to a child under an acre in size and below €500,000 in value for the purposes of building a house for occupation by the child.Some house purchasers will now be liable to stamp duty and a small number purchasing second hand houses valued below €145,833 will have to pay more than previously.  However, the recent fall in property prices means the overall cost in the transaction for purchasers is much lower than the majority of purchasers would pay.The new rates will apply to property transfers on or after 8 December 2010.  A transitional provision will be put in place to ensure anyone who has entered into a binding contract to purchase a residential property before 8 December and who executes the transfer of that property before 1 July next will not be disadvantaged.  It should be noted that as a result of the changes, stamp duty will now be payable in all residential property transactions, and this information will be used to compile a database of house valuations which will underpin the development of the new site value tax announced in the national recovery plan.  The finance Bill will contain details of this database, which will be established in advance of the site valuation tax.Financial Resolution No. 16 amends section 256(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to give statutory effect to the new rates of DIRT applicable to deposits held in banks and other financial institutions.  The changes in rates are as follows.  The general 25% rate which applies to deposit interest, including deposit interest arising on special savings and special terms accounts, will be increased by two percentage points to 27%.  In addition, the 28% rate is also being increased by two percentage points to 30%, and this rate applies to interest not payable annually or at more frequent intervals, or where the interest cannot be calculated until maturity of the investment.  This includes investments such as tracker bonds, where the amount of interest payable depends on the changes in the financial or other index over a number of years.  The resolution also amends section 267B of the Taxes Consolidation Act.The measures relating to DIRT in this budget build upon measures undertaken in earlier budgets by the Minister.  The rate increased from 20% to 23% in the 2009 budget and from 23% to 25% in the 2009 supplementary budget.  These changes form part of a move from taxes on labour and consumption, as I stated earlier.  In overall terms, the combined projected additional yield from the budget DIRT exit tax changes is estimated to be €22.5 million in 2011 and €30 million in the full year.Financial Resolution No. 17 gives statutory effect to the budget announcement that the rate of tax applying to life assurance policies and investment funds is being increased with effect from 1 January.  This amendment applies to the rates of exit taxes on domestic life assurance policies and investment undertakings under the gross roll-up regime introduced in the Finance Act 2000.  It also increases the rates of taxes which apply to profits and gains on life assurance policies and investment funds in other EU member states, EEA states and OECD countries with which Ireland has double tax agreements.Under gross roll-up investments, investments may accumulate without the imposition of a tax.  However, an exit tax applies when a chargeable event occurs, such as the receipt of payments from or the disposal of investments in the life policy or fund, or the ending of each eight-year period following the acquisition of the policy or the units in the fund.  There are varying rates of tax in these investments, depending on the frequency of payments to the investor, and additionally in the case of the foreign investments, on whether the income or gains are correctly included in the investor's tax return.

Unfortunately, over the years successive Governments began to recognise stamp duty as a revenue gathering exercise but historically it was never meant to be so; it was originally introduced in order to keep a record of the housing stock and sale and purchase of same.  As the years rolled on it became a tax-collection exercise.  The fact that there were different percentages for different valuations illustrated beyond any doubt that what I am saying was the intention.As the property market expanded, the return from this tax, as it became, increased.  As the volatility of the market surged, the amount of tax yielded from stamp duty increased in parallel.  It gave a false impression and heralded false dawns, and the fact that it was meant in the first analysis to be a register of properties as opposed to a revenue gathering exercise was forgotten, and to be truthful, it became a convenient and subtle way — if I might use the term — to collect funds from citizens.  Naturally, there was a tendency by all Governments not to upset the apple cart and it was never upset to any great extent until today.The new provision will create a great deal of certainty in how to proceed in future on valuations and allow us to understand, perhaps for the first time in many decades, precisely how we stand regarding the value of property in this country.  It will also provide us with a valuation base for property.I am not given to the overestimation of officials in the Department of Finance, no more than I am given to underestimating the proficiency of the Department, nor would I for one moment accuse them of subterfuge because I know them to be very honest and decent civil servants.  However, I am slightly concerned about the statement to the effect that today's provision helps us to form a valuation base.  I hope that in future this will not be a valuation base or springboard to a property tax.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I do not disagree with the history provided by Deputy O'Donoghue on stamp duty and how it came to play such a significant role in the property transactions which took place here over the past 15 years in particular.  It is not quite true to say nobody upset the apple cart as I remember a former colleague of the Minister for Health and Children famously announcing that his party had decided to abolish stamp duty.  The quote is indelibly framed in my mind as he said we "did not need the money".  How things have changed, as we need it now.The only question which arises is how fair is this provision.  Is this preparatory to the introduction of a property tax?  Is this an interim measure or is this likely to be a permanent feature of the landscape?  I ask the Minister to address that issue.The current exemptions, which it is proposed to abolish, are not entirely to be sneezed at.  The reliefs and exemptions which applied for property below a certain valuation and, in the case of first-time buyers, to houses below a certain square footage are not inconsequential.  I ask the Minister to address that issue.On the issue of DIRT, I am not sure I understand the difference between the two DIRT rates.  What is a long-term DIRT account as distinct from an ordinary DIRT account?  Are the former savings accounts which mature after three or five years and to which the higher DIRT rate applies?  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves we cannot very much disagree with the measure.The subsequent resolutions in respect of tackling the increase in the rate of life assurance exit tax and reducing the thresholds for capital acquisitions tax are not designed to yield a great deal of income and the Labour Party does not take particular exception to them.The debate should focus on stamp duty.  Is it envisaged that the proposed changes will be permanent?  I ask the Minister to respond on the exclusion of current exemptions and indicate how the changes will knit into the finance Bill in terms of the property tax about which the Government gave a commitment to Ajai when he was here.  Will Mr. Chopra be on the telephone to find out how this tax is to be implemented if we depart from it in any way?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	656	The accompanying documentation provided indicates that revenue from stamp duty in 2011 is expected to be €36 million over the full year.  On how many transactions is this estimate based?  I am not aware of many transactions being completed last year.  Certainly the difference between the projected figure and the many billions of euro collected in stamp duty in the past ten years is significant.I concur with Deputy O'Donoghue that the introduction of levies of 1% on all transactions up to €1 million and 2% on all transactions of more than €1 million will bring some element of certainty to the stamp duty regime.  I suspect, however, that there are few houses in my constituency or that of the Minister which will sell for more than €1 million.The debate on the stamp duty measure ignores one group which is about to be clobbered again.  I refer to those who are caught in negative equity.  Let us consider the case of a couple who bought their home for €400,000 or €500,000 at the height of the boom and paid the guts of €50,000 to the State by way of stamp duty.  The value of their asset will have reduced by 40% or 50% and may be worth €300,000.  If they are fortunate enough to be able to afford to sell their home, they will be hit a second time.  Changes in the stamp duty regime and measures elsewhere in the budget do not do anything for those, including many of our constituents who are caught in negative equity.Not once in his Budget Statement did the Minister for Finance refer to those caught up in this position.  Notwithstanding that the measures will move us towards a better stamp duty system, one group is trapped in a nightmare.  They were hit by the initial stamp duty they paid to the State, hit a second time by a substantial fall in the value of their asset and will be hit a third time if they are lucky enough to sell their house.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	657	Some of the proposed changes, especially the measures on stamp duty, are somewhat academic because I do not envisage they will deliver a substantial increase in revenue to the Exchequer.  People cannot secure loans to purchase a second-hand car, much less obtain substantial mortgages to purchase homes.  I used the qualification "somewhat" when I described the changes as academic because the second element of this measure is that it will function as an intelligence gathering exercise.  I concur with Deputy O'Donoghue that the proposal lays a foundation for a property tax as it will provide some indication of house values.  It is typical of the Government to seek to introduce a property tax rather than a wealth tax.  Taxing people who can barely pay their mortgages or in some cases cannot pay them is hardly a correct or wise approach.I welcome the proposal to increase DIRT tax from 25% to 27%, although I would have preferred the rate to increase to 30%.  Such a measure could be a little unfair but it would encourage people to utilise their money by investing it or putting it to uses other than allowing it to lie idle in banks.  To that extent, the 2% increase in DIRT tax is useful.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I support the reduction in the stamp duty rates to 1% and 2% and hope the measure will boost the housing market.  The banks must come up to the mark following this measure because people who are seeking loans and are capable of repaying them are being stymied by banks' refusing to lend to them.While I acknowledge Deputy Rabbitte's point regarding the abolition of exemptions for first-time buyers and purchases of houses with certain floor areas and so forth, all taxes should be made as simple as possible.  In this respect, the introduction of a 1% rate of stamp duty for properties sold for less than €1 million and a 2% rate for properties sold for in excess of €1 million is the correct approach.Deputy Noonan suggested that the National Asset Management Agency should dump a couple of billion euro worth of housing on the market to achieve floor prices.  I agree with the thinking behind the Deputy's proposal, albeit not the process.  Recently, a number of housing estates were placed on the market by receivers or liquidators at low prices.  NAMA and the banks should exert pressure to accelerate the process in respect of companies that are in dire trouble from which they will not be able to emerge.  A housing bank should be placed on the market to create a floor in prices.I concur with Deputy Morgan on the changes to DIRT tax.  An increase of 2% in the rate is reasonable because a substantial amount of the money held in savings should be invested in businesses to create employment.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	662	We are witnessing a deathbed conversion by the Government on the question of tax versus property reliefs and a belated admission that the latter are unsustainable.  The exemption threshold for stamp duty is set at €127,000, a modest price to pay for a house even in today's deflated market.  Why was consideration not given to introducing a baseline threshold of 1% on house purchases?  A threshold creates circumstances in which people become fearful of exceeding the sum in question and inhibits prices from exceeding a certain level.I would like to hear what consideration was given to introducing a 1% tax on the first euro spent on the purchase of a house.Another issue mentioned by Deputy Hayes and other speakers was negative equity which, according to figures, will generate an estimated income of €36 million next year.  I am not sure how that figure was arrived at given that the market is not active in any way and when there are people are in negative equity the chances of second-hand home sales taking place next year will be very low.  A particular concern is repossession whereby a person's home is sold against his or her will.  Will the 1% tax apply?  Will the person  be taken to the High Court, have the home repossessed and when banking and legal fees are cleared remain in negative equity after the sale with a tax to pay as an additional penalty?The language used by the Minister today is very worrying.  He spoke about stimulating the property market.  This was the type of language that got us into the difficulty in the first instance.  The situation was that investment property was favoured over residential home occupation.  I am very concerned to hear this sort of language being reintroduced.  What we need to see in the housing market is normalisation whereby residential ownership is preferred over investment development.  Key to that, although it seemed to be secondary in the Minister's presentation, is the issue of a house price register database.  That appears to be an aside to the taxation model after which, when the taxation measures are put in place, we will consider having a house price register database.  We should have heard about such a database tonight because it is a key issue and an immediate priority.  It would provide the sort of normalisation that would bring back confidence to the housing market.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	663	When the Government tinkered with stamp duty previously the predicted consequences did not happen.  What was said would happen did not transpire;  very often the opposite effect was seen in the property market.We are being given very little information as to the reasoning of the Government in this respect and it would have been much more helpful, for example, had we been given a table with the old stamp duty rates being compared to the proposed rates.  I note, for example, that, on page 33, 2% is substituted for 9%.  Will the Minister clarify what the 9% figure comprised?  Why is 2% being substituted?  I have a vague idea what may be the reason but perhaps the Minister will clarify.  The point needs to be made that whatever were the wrongs of the previous stamp duty regime, it did not cause the property bubble.  The fact that we were getting so much money from stamp duty may have made the Exchequer too reliant on the property bubble but stamp duty of itself did not cause the bubble.  One point about the old regime was that people were differentiated.  First-time buyers were differentiated from investors.  That seems to have gone now and everybody is to be treated the same way.  We may want to get the property market moving again but we do not want to encourage and help vulture investors to come here and buy property on the cheap.  Will the Minister explain what the 9% charge was so that we may be sure about what we are doing?

The group people want to help now are those who bought houses or, in particular, apartments, some years ago and now want to trade up and buy a family home but are in negative equity.  We probably cannot do anything very positive for them but at least we are now asking them to pay only 1% if they trade up with their negative equity rather than whatever the rate was — 5%, 7%, 9%, or whatever.  This measure goes some way towards rectifying the situation for the group which is most needy at present.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	667	The Commission on Taxation recommended that we substantially lower the rate of stamp duty but broaden its base and the Minister clearly took that on board in his budgetary decision to make the rate 1% or 2%.  I am trying to remember what the previous higher rate applied to; I believe it was €655,000.  The first €125,000 had a zero rate, the next €875,000 was at 7% and for a price higher than that the rate was 9%.  As I understand it, when one went over that price one paid 9% on everything.  I remember during the last election, which seems such a long time ago, my colleague suggested that instead of jumping from 7% to 9% and paying 9% on everything that the rate be tiered.  The situation may have changed even since then.  At the time we were running enormous surpluses, as everybody knows.The idea now is that everybody will pay something, either 1% or 2%, which is reasonable.  In order to broaden the base there are to be no exemptions, including for new houses or lower-priced second-hand houses.  It is not a prerequisite for a property tax but will provide key information and a database in regard to site and property values which we have not had before.  I have no doubt that such a database will be important in informing all of us about the upcoming site valuation tax which is mentioned in the four year plan.Deputy Rabbitte raised the issue of DIRT.  As I understand it, there are differences in products sold by insurance or investment holding companies, such as collective investment undertakings where interest is not paid on an annual or fixed basis but is rolled up and paid infrequently or on the maturity of the investment.  When I asked if the 30% rate equates with the 28% rate on deposits and savings accounts where interest is paid frequently I was advised it is not scientific but is as close as possible to equating the two situations, as between——

They saw the tax gradually rising from 20% in recent years to virtually 30% in some cases.  I ask the Minister to clarify at what age exemptions will apply after this measure is implemented.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	672	I have a brief supplementary question.  There was a reference in the Minister's speech to a new discounted tenant household purchase scheme in which an additional discount would be given to tenants who wished to purchase their local authority home.  Will the new stamp duty regulations apply in that case, given that the transactions are less than  €1 million?

The Minister proposes that the current tenancy purchase programme, at 3% for a maximum of ten years, will now be extended to 15 years, giving a 45% reduction in the purchase price of the local authority house.  Two years ago during discussion on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill we proposed this to the Minister but he did not accept it at the time.  If a person purchases a property from a local authority through a tenant purchase programme, will stamp duty apply?

The officials will clarify that for me.With regard to the exemption from DIRT, the annual exemption limit is currently €20,000 in the case of a single person and €40,000 in the case of a married couple.  That has now been reduced to €18,000 and €36,000 respectively.

Financial Resolution No. 23: Income Tax — Artists’ Exemption
(1) THAT section 195(3) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (No. 39 of 1997) be amended as respects the year of assessment 2011 and each subsequent year of assessment-----(a) in paragraph (a), by substituting “subject to paragraphs (aa) and (b)” for “subject to paragraph (b)”, and(b) by inserting the following after paragraph (a):"(aa) The amount of the profits or gains which shall be disregarded for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts by virtue of  paragraph (a) shall not exceed €40,000 for a year of assessment.”.(2) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).I wish to deal with Financial Resolutions Nos. 19 to 23, inclusive.  Financial Resolution No. 19 deals with the treatment of relevant trading charges on income and the compensation of the relief due in respect of foreign tax paid by a company on its foreign income.  In general, relevant trading charges on income are paid on royalties paid in the course of a trade.  Schedule 24 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out how the amount of such relief is computed.Paragraph 4(5) of that Schedule 24 permits a company to allocate certain charges on income as it thinks fit for this purpose.  It has been generally accepted that paragraph 4(5) does not permit a company to allocate relevant trading charges on the income in this matter.  This financial resolution puts the position beyond doubt.  The resolution will be effective as from today.  It will apply to, first, all returns for corporation tax, second, all claims to repayment of corporation tax and, third, all claims to reduction of liability to corporation tax made to the Revenue Commissioners from today.Financial Resolutions Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, deal with the restriction and the phased abolition of property based legacy reliefs related to section 23 type reliefs on capital allowances.  In the period since budget 2006, virtually all the area based and property tax incentive schemes have been terminated.  Subject to transitional arrangements on projects already in the pipeline, all of the urban renewal, town renewal, rural renewal, accelerated capital allowances for hotels, capital allowances for holiday cottages, student accommodation, multistorey car parks, third level educational buildings, sports injury clinics, park and ride facilities and general rental refurbishment schemes have by now come to an end.  In addition, most of the remaining property reliefs in the health and child care areas have been abolished, with similar transitional arrangements.Different variations of these schemes have been in existence in one shape or another since the early 1980s and even though the schemes have, by and large, ended, there is still an ongoing legacy cost to the Exchequer as the various tax reliefs which were originally given are gradually being used up by the investors.  The Government has clearly stated in the national recovery plan that in current circumstances it is no longer acceptable that measures abolished as far back as 2006 should continue to cost almost €400 million per annum.  We have committed to the phased abolition of these legacy reliefs over the period of the plan.The restriction of reliefs measure which was introduced in 2007 and further enhanced in 2010 has already curtailed the ability of individuals to utilise these reliefs, thereby spreading the cost over a much longer period.  Although the annual Exchequer cost of these schemes is expected to decline in future years anyway, the way in which the reliefs are claimed against taxable income means it may take considerable time before the tax system is finally clear of them.  In the context of the national recovery plan, the Government has decided to take steps to curtail this legacy cost over a much shorter and definite time period.  These steps are provided for in Financial Resolutions Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, which will commence with immediate effect.There are two broad categories of tax relief which are addressed in these measures and they apply equally to companies and to individuals.  These are tax relief for residential rental accommodation, commonly known as section 23 type relief, and accelerated capital allowances in regard to the provision of a wider variety of buildings and structures.  These allowances can be made over seven, ten and greater than ten year periods, depending on the circumstances.  The third category of residential relief which applies to owner occupiers is unaffected by these current measures.  There is a natural end date to this form of relief in any case.Under the heading of section 23 type relief, the following changes are being introduced with immediate effect.  The current rules require that to avail of the relief the property must be let under a qualifying lease for the first ten years.  From 1 January 2011 any relief which is not used in the ten year period will be automatically lost.  Properties which have already passed the ten year deadline will not be allowed to carry unused relief forward in 2011 while all other properties will lose it once the ten year deadline has been reached.Until now, section 23 type relief can be set against all rental income of that person.  From 1 January 2011 the use of the relief will in all cases be restricted solely to rental income from the section 23 property itself.  Currently, when a person sells a section 23 property within the ten year period, any relief already given to him or her is clawed back and given to the new owner, who only has to hold the property for the balance of the period.  From 1 January 2011 the claw-back will continue to apply but the new owner will get none of the relief.Finally, for section 23 properties which remain unsold as of 30 June 2011, the ten year period will begin on that day.  If such a property is not sold for a further two years, for example, there will only be a further eight years in which to claim the relief.  In effect, this new measure will ensure that all section 23 type relief will end by 30 June 2021.Under the heading of capital allowances there are two discrete but interlinked classes of changes which are being introduced in these financial resolutions.  The first change will narrow the range of incomes to which the allowances can apply while the second change will curtail the ability of the person to carry forward unused allowances beyond certain deadlines.  All of these measures apply with effect from today.  The measures will only apply to capital allowances arising under the various incentive schemes to which I referred earlier and only to persons who are passive investors in the relevant businesses.  By that, I mean those who are not actively engaged in the conduct of the respective businesses.  These prescriptions are already well understood and are already provided for in a related context in tax law.With immediate effect, where any individual becomes entitled to capital allowances in respect of a building or structure for use in a trade, those allowances may only be set against the income of that trade.  The allowances can no longer be used against income from another trade or against any other form of income.  This restriction will apply to allowances arising in any particular year as well as those carried forward from a previous year.Where a person has let a building or structure and is receiving rental income from it, capital allowances may only be set against the rental income from the building or structure itself.  This restriction is analogous to one restricting the use of section 23 type relief.  Currently, the rate at which normal capital allowances for industrial buildings is given is 4% per annum over 25 years.  Under the various property and area based tax incentive schemes, this period can be shortened to seven or ten years, and in some cases to periods greater than ten years but less than 25 years.  Obviously, the annual rate of allowances is higher when the period is shorter, and these are commonly known as accelerated capital allowances.The changes which are being introduced will apply with effect from today and are as follows.  For the seven and ten year schemes, any unused capital allowances carried forward beyond the seven or ten year end dates will be lost.  This will apply both to circumstances where the end date has yet to be reached and those where the date is already passed.  In the latter case, the carried forward amount will be lost immediately.  Where the capital allowance is given over a period greater than ten years, this period is now being revised downwards to seven years from the year it was first claimed.  The consequences of this are that, in circumstances where this seven year period has already elapsed, any capital allowances which have yet to be given, as well as those carried forward in the current year, will be lost.  Where the seven year period has not elapsed, the aggregate of capital allowances not yet given by that time will be reduced by 20% and given over the balance of the seven year period.  In all cases, any capital allowances carried forward beyond the seven-year period will be lost.The reason for introducing the amount of future capital allowances by 20% in these circumstances is to take account of the fact that these allowances are now being made available faster than would otherwise have been the case.  In fact, these types of schemes tended to frontload the allowances, typically with 50% of the total allowance being made available in the first year.  The impact of the 20% reduction in these circumstances is modest.A guillotine will be introduced to terminate all unclaimed and unused capital allowances arising after or carried forward from 2014 as well as unused section 23 relief carried forward from 2014.  An impact assessment will be undertaken of the effects of the phased abolition of the property based measures and the guillotine provision.In conclusion, I accept these are radical changes to the terms of these property schemes.  However, the current economic circumstances demand that these radical steps be taken now rather than later.  I am confident that, over the course of the national recovery plan, the Exchequer impact of the legacy of these area based and property tax incentive schemes will have been significantly reduced by this series of measures.  On that basis, I commend these financial resolutions to the House.Financial Resolution No. 23 amends section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in regard to the income tax exemption which currently applies to the earnings of artists.  The effect of the resolution will be to limit for the tax year 2011 and subsequent tax years the amount of the exempt income to €40,000 per claimant per annum.  In section 195 there is currently no limit on the amount which can be claimed per annum, although the high earners restriction introduced in 2007 and extended in 2010 may limit the amount of an artist exemption in cases where gross income reaches €125,000.  Over a full tax year, this measure is expected to produce a saving of approximately €14 million.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	679	With regard to Financial Resolutions Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, the Minister is correct to state this is quite a radical change.  Nonetheless, it is a change that has been largely supported on this side of the House, at least in respect of bringing to an end some of the reliefs that have been in place for some time.  How is it possible that a figure of €100 million is given as a potential saving in a full year?  It presupposes that we know the total number of individuals who have been able to obtain the section 23 relief thus far.  If the Minister claims that a saving of €100 million can be made in a full year, will he inform the House as to the number of individuals affected by the roll-up?The Minister stated that the guillotine provision will be introduced by 2014, by which time all the unused capital allowance must be lost.  Why was 2014, which is three years from now, selected as the date?  Given the desire to have a greater yield, why was an earlier date not set?  The Minister said the full impact statement has yet to be determined.  One would have expected that it would have been in place before the decision was arrived at.With regard to the changes to the artists' exemption, many people have been arguing for some time that we should have been moving in this direction.  I hope the change will not destroy the possibility of Ministers on the other side of the House writing their memoirs when they move to this side of the House in the next few weeks or so.

Is the yield of €100 million a quarter of this?  Does it mean the changes being made to the schemes will result in a yield that is 25% of the yield that might accrue if the pruning were more severe?  What are the considerations in trying to make the restrictions more severe?  Are there contractual issues or others that constrain one?  Reliefs in this area fuelled the system that resulted in much of the overhang of housing and apartments.   The section 23 relief, which is probably the best known, will be restricted in application to income from section 23 property as distinct from rental income.The wish is to try to have some kind of market operating again in terms of disposing of the overhang in urban areas, where there is undoubtedly pent-up demand.  However, young people and first-time buyers do not want to move if they believe that, in six months, values will have fallen by another 7%.  It is very difficult to know the floor in circumstances such as these.  It is important that some kind of market be regenerated where there is a population and demand, for all the obvious reasons, but some of what are referred to as legacy relief schemes have outserved their usefulness and ought to have been brought to an end or pared back long before now.  Why is €100 million the figure determined for a full year?  Why not €200 million in a full year?  What difference would the latter figure make?  Are there contractual or constitutional impediments in the way of pruning more severely?What judgment was brought to bear on the capping of the earnings threshold for artists?  As with many exemptions that served a very useful role at one stage, the artists' exemption came to be abused.  I do not know the result of the cost benefit analysis.  If one makes the threshold relatively harmless, is the exemption of any value in attracting artists to live here who might not otherwise consider doing so?  Does the Minister believe the threshold of €40,000 is well judged?

As with Deputy Rabbitte, I would like the Minister to explain where the €40,000 figure has appeared from.  It seems to have come from nowhere.  It does not account fully for the context in which artists earn their money.  A sum of €40,000 may sound like a lot of money but if one is an artist working on a commission that takes two years, one must pay tax for one year rather than two years when one gets paid.The circumstances of many artists must be borne in mind.  Most of them will not even reach the threshold.  Certain artists who formerly enjoyed the artists' tax exemption disappeared from our shores as soon as there was a hint of capping the exemption.  Some big bands are included in this regard.  I do not believe the exemption was ever intended for rich artists, but perhaps it was.  It may be the only good legacy of Mr. Charlie Haughey.  Ireland has benefited from it.There needs to be a cost benefit analysis.  The Minister referred to encouraging tourism.  One attraction of having internationally famous artists here or their works is that people will travel to view where an author grew up or to see a work of art.  Will the Minister explain where the figure of €40,000 came from?  We should not have an open-ended exemption but should bear in mind that a threshold that would benefit tourism and artists would be higher than €40,000.

As implied by Deputy Rabbitte, the market was over-fuelled.  There are more than 2,000 ghost estates, not just in urban centres but in other centres across the country.  Seán Lemass, the former esteemed Taoiseach, reputedly said, "Tell me how many bags of cement you sold last year and I'll tell you the state of your economy."  I appeal to Members of this House, in accelerating our desire to ensure a property bubble of the nature that occurred does not recur, to remind ourselves that one day not so far away a future Government will have to come into this House and ignite the spark of the construction industry again.  Its failure to do that at some stage in the future will mean a continuum of unemployment for thousands of ordinary workers.  When we use euphemisms to describe the collapse of the building industry, let us also ensure we remind ourselves of where precisely we are coming from, where we are and to where we must get back.

It was the brainchild of the great Irish poet, Anthony Cronin, who happily is still with us, who inspired Charles Haughey, the then Taoiseach, to bring forward this relief.  It was not meant to make millions for any given individual.  It was not meant to set up record companies, and it certainly was not meant to create an elite.  It was meant to give expression to Ireland's unique cultural identity and in that context it was also meant as a haven for great artists who might come into this country and give expression through painting, poetry, novels or other ways to Ireland's history and cultural heritage.  To that extent, let it be said, it was an enormous success.I understand the economic exigencies which see the ceiling come down to €40,000 and I understand the philosophy behind that, but I am greatly minded of the words of William Butler Yeats who said one should never seek to extract the marrow from the bone.  He wrote:What need you being come to sense,But fumble in a greasy tillAnd add the halfpence to the penceAnd prayer to shivering prayer, untilYou have dried the marrow from the bone.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I remind Deputy O'Donoghue that Yeats also wrote: "All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born."  Regrettably, that is the reality we are coming to face in painful and stark terms in the context of this year's budget.I am particularly interested in two issues, the first of which is the changes in section 23 reliefs.  What is the basis for the Government's decision to restrict the rowing back of reliefs just to the section 23 developments?  For example, we have developments in the student accommodation area which were equally attractive and which fuelled extensive provision, overly extensive in certain locations.  What is the basis for the singling out of section 23?  Why is it that others were or were not looked at as the case may be?  Is the figure of €100 million a guesstimate or is there some scientific basis behind it?I am also interested in the artists' relief, although not so much on the basis of the figure of €40,000.  I would preface my remarks along the lines of the previous speaker and Deputy Ó Snodaigh to say that in times such as those in which we now live, very often the only ray of hope and light relief we get is from the artistic community.  It is very important that especially those who are struggling to make a living, many of whom have operated on incomes at or below the minimum wage, are given every assistance possible.I am interested in what constitutes artistic endeavour, and the Minister might address this in his response.  We have ghost written autobiographies of former leaders of this country which qualify currently for exemption under the artistic endeavour clause in this scheme.  That is not for what it was ever intended.  It must be about creativity.  It must be about fostering a climate of——

This is an attempt to go back to basics but critical to that would be a clear definition of what constitutes artistic endeavour.  As I understand it, it is a question of a negotiation or a conversation between the Revenue Commissioners and the artist.  That is too loose an arrangement to be acceptable.  I note the former Minister is nodding his head to the effect that it may not be that loose an arrangement but that is the impression that has been given.  The Minister might clarify that matter.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I want to declare an interest in that I claim relief under section 23.  I want to refer to this measure not in regard to my case but to a more general case.  Deputies Ó Snodaigh and I are in an area where there are hundreds if not thousands of empty section 23 apartments along Cork Street and in that vicinity.  Many people who have purchased and are the landlords in those apartments are civil servants, public service workers and people who earn a PAYE income.  They are good landlords who look after their tenants.  Some of them operate through the rental accommodation scheme.  The amount of trouble that emanates from the section 23 measure is minimal in comparison with the rogue landlords who sometimes operate in the multi-unit old houses who act in a totally different manner.  If those hundreds of apartments are to sell in my constituency, for a two-bed apartment one is talking about €250,000 and if one gets a rental income of €1,000 a month, €250,000 at 5% is €12,500, the interest on the loan would not be covered by the rent, leaving aside management charges, insurance cover and all the other items.I would like the Minister to consider in the Finance Bill the implication of the loan that has been taken out on the understanding that there would be the wherewithal to pay it from other rental income that would have offset to some extent the tax that would otherwise have been paid.  There is no way that in ten years the capital cost of any section 23 apartment will be covered by the rental income from that apartment.  It is inconceivable, unlikely and cannot be done.In regard to the artists' exemption, most of the artists in this city earn significantly less than €40,000.  They are more likely to earn €20,000, €25,000 or €30,000 per annum.  Taking into account actors who are resting, which is the term commonly used, for a long period, the idea of having a €40,000 base is excellent.  At the same time it means that those such as Bono and other members of U2 and major authors who can afford it will be able to pay on the basis of what they can afford.

Nuair a bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Aire Airgeadais níos luaithe, dúirt sé go gcuirfí deireadh leis an bhfaoiseamh seo i 2014.  Ag amharc ar na sonraí, áfach, tá sé soiléir go mbeidh cuid dóibh ar fáil go dtí 2021.  Iarraim ar an Aire é sin a shoiléiriú.  Níl dabht ar bith go bhfuilimid ag bogadh sa treo ceart.  Tá mo phairtí ag rá le fada an lá gur cheart dúinn deireadh a chur leis an bhfaoiseamh seo.  Is mór an trua gur ghlac sé an oiread ama seo don Rialtas tús a chur leis an bpróiseas sin.Ba mhaith liom cuid de na pointí atá déanta agam a shoiléiriú i mBéarla.  I note in this speech earlier today the Minister for Finance, on the property based reliefs, stated, "This last provision will effectively terminate all property-based reliefs in 2014."  He went on to state that all details are set out in the Summary of Budget Measures.  When one looks at the Summary of Budget Measures, it does not seem that all those property reliefs will be finished in 2014.  If we look at the section 23 reliefs for properties that have yet to be sold, what is being proposed here is that the ten year qualifying period for unsold properties will kick-start on 30 June 2011, regardless of them being sold.  Therefore, the summary continues, "in such cases no Section 23 relief will be available after 30 June 2021."  Is it the case that section 23 reliefs will still be made available to people ten years from now, and further than that, up to 30 June 2021?  How does that correspond with the Minister's statement today that this will effectively terminate all property based reliefs in 2014?  That takes me to the second point.  Why are we looking at 2014 for the guillotine?  Why can we not introduce the guillotine earlier?Even in the case of the section 23 properties that are not sold, why are we starting the effective ten year period on 30 June 2011?  Why are we not starting it tonight, next week or in January?  Why are we giving that additional six month period?  Are we serious about phasing out these reliefs?  What are the blocks here?  Are there legal blocks to stop us introducing the guillotine earlier?  Can we not phase out these reliefs any quicker?These people gambled on property.  I disagree fundamentally with one of the previous speakers, Deputy O'Donoghue, when he spoke about fuelling the construction sector.  We want to fuel the construction sector.  That is why we are arguing to build schools, hospitals and roads, but we will not start building property again to lie idle and then provide reliefs for the next ten or 11 years on the back of which persons may claim tax exemptions.  I seek clarification on those points.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	696	There were a number of questions on the section 23 and other property reliefs.  As participants joined the schemes at different stages, many have availed of some of the reliefs at this point.  Others have availed of less of them.  That is why 2014 was selected as a median date in terms of addressing all of the considerations, which are many when one considers the various schemes and the differences that arose between the various properties.  Some of them, I understand, are as old as 20 years.  The belief was that some measures which were introduced in 2006 would have the impact of finishing these schemes much quicker than has been the case but, because of the nature of their design over several years that has not been possible and the decision to go with 2014 is a median that seems to be acceptable, and reachable, which is an important consideration.Deputy Rabbitte asked about the constitutional and legal considerations, if there are any.  The legal advice is that the restriction on the property reliefs is legally sound.  However, there is also advice that the speed in closing down the reliefs needs to be proportionate.  That is a standard consideration in matters of this nature in any event.  The advice also suggested that it was appropriate to have a full assessment of the impacts before the complete shutdown of the scheme in this instance.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	697	Is the Minister stating that a €200 million saving as distinct from a €100 million would not be proportionate?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	698	I will come in a minute to how the €400 million and the €100 million is reached.The final close down in 2014, the guillotine which I mentioned, is designed to allow for this assessment to take place on the full impact of the way they are being wound up and to ensure that all possible impacts are identified and taken account of in view of the considerations mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte and others.Based on the latest data, the cost of the legacy reliefs was estimated at €400 million and when developing the initiative to terminate the schemes, the timescale of four years was taken as being a median being acceptable in terms of achieving the assessment and in terms of winding down in a proportionate manner, and on that basis the €100 million arises as a quarter of the €400 million.The points made by Deputy Ardagh were considered when this proposal was being developed and the view was taken that, no more than anybody else in society, those who were involved with the section 23 schemes ought also to make a contribution towards the financial adjustments being made currently.Deputy Creed asked about student accommodation and all of the other schemes which I listed at the beginning of my contribution — there are approximately a dozen of them in all.  They all are restricted by the capital allowances restriction and, in fact, in most instances have been restricted previously, both in 2006 and earlier this year.  The figures are based on the Exchequer costs in recent years, and the Exchequer costs have dropped in the past year.D'iarr an Teachta Ó Dochartaigh ceist faoin na bhfaoiseamh cánach a chríochnóidh i gcoitinne i 2014.

The first point to bear in mind is that the Commission on Taxation recommended that this exemption be finished and the Government took the view that there were some benefits, as outlined by several Deputies.

It is well to bear in mind that the Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition.The average income of the artists availing of the scheme is of the order of €32,000.  This is a little above the average.  Many Deputies will have heard from various artists that the benefits from participation in, or having the availability of, the scheme are considerable for those on fairly low or modest earnings.  On that basis, the Government considered that going with the Commission on Taxation proposal was not a good idea.  I can assure Deputy Brian Hayes that I have no plans to write memoirs.  I regret somewhat that I did not keep a diary of some of the events.

The Minister spoke of proportionality, but it is wrong if the Government is willing to allow for section 23 reliefs to be paid up until 2021.  The whole country is demanding that we end these property based reliefs.  I stated already that the Government is moving in the right direction, but it is fundamentally wrong to allow property based tax reliefs to continue for a period of 11 years.If we park that point to one side now and say that I will lose the argument that we should introduce a guillotine on these the same as we are doing in terms of the 2014 measure, it may be proportionate for us to only allow the reliefs for the houses that are not sold for a five year period so that at least they would be phased out over half the period that the Minister is accepting.  Why can we not introduce the ten-year period for these reliefs now?  Why are we allowing six months prior to the ten-year period kicking in?  I refer back to the Minister's statement today which he made to the Dáil but during which he spoke to the nation when he said that effectively all property tax reliefs will be finished by 2014.  This is simply untrue given the measures contained in these resolutions which will allow property tax reliefs until 2011 and a grace period of six months before the start period kicks in.

The capital cost of the provision of certain free or subsidised child care facilities by employers is exempt from benefit-in-kind charge on the employees that avail of such facilities.  This relief was introduced in 1999 to encourage employers to invest in child care facilities and thus increase the overall supply of child care places.  At the time of its introduction there was a scarcity of child care places and the costs associated with child care were increasing.  The provisions were amended in 2001 to permit a number of smaller employers to come together in the provision of child care facilities.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that in practice only larger employers avail of the relief.  The Commission on Taxation in its report recommended the abolition of this exemption citing equity due to the likelihood that only large employers have the ability to make the necessary investments.  It is now proposed that this provision be abolished with effect from 1 January 2011.  The cost to the employer of providing such a benefit in kind for each individual employee will now be assessed as part of the employee's emoluments for the year and the appropriate taxpayer levies will be collected through the PAYE system.  The estimated yield to the Exchequer will be €3 million in 2011 and €6 million in a full year.Financial Resolution No. 25 relates to section 472C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which was introduced in 2001 to provide income tax relief for trade union subscriptions for trade union members.  The amount of relief at present is €350 at the standard rate of tax which is equivalent to a tax credit of €70.  As part of the national recovery plan and with a view to widening the tax base it has been decided that this relief will be abolished for the tax year 2011 and subsequent tax years.  The estimated yield to the Exchequer will be €19 million in 2011 and €26 million in a full year.Financial Resolution No. 26 relates to section 118(5E) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides for an exemption from benefit-in-kind charge where an employer meets the cost of professional fees or subscriptions on behalf of an employee or a director where the membership is relevant to the employment.  This exemption is being removed with effect from 1 January 2011.  In future, when an employer pays such fees the amount will be treated as a notional pay and PAYE and PRSI shall be deducted accordingly.  Details will be published in the finance Bill.Financial Resolution No. 27 is with regard to section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides for tax relief at the standard rate in respect of rent paid by individuals for private rented accommodation which is their sole or main residence.  Rent relief was introduced in 1982 and has been increased a number of times since its introduction.  The provisional cost of rent relief in 2008 was €97 million.  However, since 2008 rents have fallen considerably.  CSO figures for the first ten months of the year show that rents fell by 14.5% in 2009 and a further 5.9% in 2010.The level of rent qualifying for relief depends on an individual's marital status and age.  The maximum tax credit available under the scheme for those over 55 years of age is €1,600 for a married couple and €800 for a single individual and it is €800 and €400 respectively for those under 55.  The Commission on Taxation was of the view that in the same way that mortgage interest relief increased the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private residential accommodation.  For this reason, the commission recommended that rent relief should be discontinued.Deputies will recall that in the budget for 2010 the Minister abolished mortgage interest relief for new mortgages taken out after 1 January 2013.  Those entitled to that relief at present will retain it until 31 December 2017.  It has now been decided to abolish rent relief on a phased basis over the same period.  In order to maximise the Exchequer yields from this measure, new claimants will not be able to claim the relief with effect from today.  Withdrawal of the relief over this period will be achieved by reducing the amount of rent that can be relieved by 20% in the years 2011 and 2012, with further annual reductions of 10% thereafter until 2018.  Based on 2008 provisional figures, the annual yield to the Exchequer for such a phased withdrawal will be €19.4 million in 2011, €38.8 million in 2012 and the yield thereafter will increase annually until 2018 when the relief will be completely withdrawn.Financial Resolution No. 28 gives statutory effect to the budget announcement that tax relief for certain share option schemes will cease from 24 November 2010, the date of publication of the national recovery plan.  Employees who are given options to purchase shares in their employer company at a predetermined price can make a gain when they purchase shares that have increased in value since the option was vented.  Such gains are exempt from income tax where the employer company meets certain conditions and receives formal approval for the scheme from the Revenue Commissioners.The Commission on Taxation was tasked with reviewing all tax expenditure with a view to assessing the economic and social benefits they deliver and to recommend the discontinuation of those that are unjustified on cost benefit grounds.  It is recommended that this scheme be discontinued on the basis of the low employee participation rate compared with participation in unapproved share option schemes that do not allow such income tax exemption.  The termination of this scheme is also motivated by the requirement to rebalance the public finances and to broaden our tax base.  The scheme is estimated to have cost €500,000 in 2009, the most recent year for which estimates are available.Financial Resolution No. 29 gives statutory effect to the budget announcement terminating the scheme that provides for a single lifetime income tax deduction of up to €6,350 for an employee who purchases shares in his or her employer company where those shares are retained for a period of three years without being sold.  The Commission on Taxation recommended that the scheme be discontinued on the basis of the low employee participation rate.  The most recent figures are for 2008 when 280 individuals participated at a cost to the Exchequer of €300,000.Financial Resolution No. 30 gives statutory effect to the budget announcement that the taxation of an employee's emoluments in the form of shares or stocks would be brought within the PAYE collection system.  Where an employee does not pay full market value for shares, the shares are treated as perquisites for income tax purposes and taxed at remuneration of the employment.  However, unlike other types of remuneration the income tax charged on the value of such shares is paid through the self-assessment system and not through the PAYE system.  This resolution brings the payment and collection of income tax and share rewards into the PAYE system and aligns the tax treatment with that of other types of benefits-in-kind received by employees.  This measure will not increase the amount of income tax charged but may, depending on when shares are received, result in earlier payment of tax.  In the case of employees, the payment of PRSI is linked to whatever remuneration is payable through the PAYE system.  In addition, this resolution will bring the share rewards within the charge of PRSI.Financial Resolution No. 31, on section 248 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was introduced in 1974 to incentivise individuals to invest in Irish companies by giving them tax relief in respect of interest paid on moneys borrowed to purchase an interest in or make a loan to a company.  The relief was reviewed by the Department of Finance in 2005 when there was a general review of tax incentives.  The findings at the time included that there was little evidence to show that the relief led to increased employment or had any notable effect on economic growth.  It was also found that companies benefiting from the relief were not in general operating in sectors being actively supported by the State through Enterprise Ireland and that the majority of those individuals using the relief earned in excess of €200,000.As a result of this review, the relief was curtailed in the budget for 2006 to exclude relief on interest for loans to acquire shares in certain companies.  Despite this change, there has been a lack of evidence which demonstrates a return from this relief in terms of employment and growth.  Given the cost of the relief, which was estimated at €48.5 million in 2008, and the need for the income tax base to be widened by the elimination of inefficient reliefs and incentives it has been decided that interest payable on such loans taken out after 7 December 2010 will not qualify for relief.The relief in respect of interest on existing loans will be phased out.  For the tax year 2011 relief will be given in respect of 75% of the interest paid; for the tax year 2012 relief would be given in respect of 50% of the interest paid; for the tax year 2013 relief will be given in respect of 25% of the interest paid; and for the tax year 2014 and subsequent years the relief will be abolished.  It should be noted that the Government's commitment to supporting investment in small and medium Irish companies by their owners and other potential investors is not diminished by the winding down of this inefficient and expensive relief.  The new business investment targeting employment incentive will employ a better focused scheme of tax relief to incentivise owners and others to invest in small and medium Irish companies.The estimated yields for the Exchequer will be €12.1 million in 2011; €24.3 million in 2012; €36.4 million in 2013; and €48.5 million in 2014.The purpose of resolutions Nos. 32 and 33 is to abolish the tax exemption for patent royalty income and the related exemption for distributions made by a company out of exempt patent royalty income.  This is provided for in the four year plan and will yield an estimated €50 million in a full year.  The measure takes effect from 24 November, the date of publication of the plan.  The tax exemption for patent income which is available to Irish resident individuals and companies is provided for in section 234 and 141 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 234 provides a tax exemption for royalty in respect of a qualifying patent, subject to an annual limit of €5 million.  A qualifying patent is a patent in relation to which all the research, planning and development work leading to the patented invention was carried out in the State or in another country which is part of the European Economic Area.Section 141 provides a tax exemption, subject to certain restrictions, for distributions made to Irish resident persons from companies' exempt patent income.  The relief is being abolished on foot of a recommendation to this effect in the report of the Commission on Taxation, which recommendation the Government has accepted.  As part of its terms of reference, the commission was asked to review all the expenditure to determine if the continued operation of the exemptions was justified on cost benefit grounds.  The commission concluded that the relief has not resulted to any great extent in companies carrying out research and development activity and that the relief was being used in some cases by companies as a tax avoidance device to remunerate employees.  It considered that there was a significant dead weight element to the relief and that it provided a windfall gain after a successful invention rather than an incentive to encourage new research and development.  The Government agrees with the conclusions of the commission that available resources should be focused instead on the research and development tax credit scheme.  That scheme provides a more direct and effective incentive for enterprises to innovate and invest in research and development activities and the scheme has been enhanced significantly by the Government in recent years for this purpose.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	709	I wish to address the issue of the removal of the benefit in kind exemption for employer provided child care.  The yield is expected to be approximately €6 million in a full year.  Access to and affordability of child care is a major issue as the cost of child care is the equivalent of a second mortgage and more for many families.  I know of someone in Dublin who pays €2,400 a month for three children under school-going age.  Child care facilities provided by an employer may seem to place employees in an enviable situation but we should consider what the consequences for employees would be of not having access to child care at an affordable price.  Often people without affordable child care cannot take up employment opportunities.Another aspect we should consider is community child care facilities that are scattered throughout the country.  I must declare an interest in this area as one of my children is in such a facility.  These facilities are subsidised through a tiered system and Deputy O'Donoghue, as a former Minister, can take some credit for the network of such facilities.  However, we only have a patchwork arrangement.  Some communities are well served with such facilities, while others have no access to child care.  We could argue that the optimum provision is where employers provide a facility for their employees.The expected yield from the removal of the exemption is only €6 million.  Rather than remove it, we should be striving to provide a much more comprehensive pre-school child care arrangement at an affordable price.  Instead, this proposal dismantles a positive development.  I agree that it may only be public service employees or the employees of large corporations who benefit from employer provided child care and that the majority of employees of small companies do not have access to this type of facility.  However, that does not mean that affordable child care provision is not laudable or should not be encouraged.It seems that we have not thought through the issue of the affordability of child care.  Given that we are going through a crisis, the Minister has with the stroke of a pen dismantled one of the most innovative provisions in terms of child care and is penalising beneficiaries without having put in place a comprehensive child care programme.  This is a retrograde step.  In terms of the minuscule amount of money this move will save, the Minister should step back from it.We should be striving for a nationwide, comprehensive, community not-for-profit provision of child care that was subsidised in a tiered way relative to employment status.  In the interim, we should not penalise employers who had the foresight to avail of the incentives that were there to provide a service for employees.  In light of the costs involved for child care for young couples, the removal of the exemption is a seriously retrograde step.  I appeal to the Minister, in the interest of the children and of the ability of parents to be able to afford to go to work, to revoke this decision.  One could argue that subsidised community child care facilities sometimes act as a disincentive for people to take up employment opportunities but in this case we are talking about people who are working and availing of a service that has been provided by employers.  Now, in one fell swoop, the Minister will dismantle this progressive service for the sake of a relatively small amount of money.By its nature, child care affects younger people.  These are the same people who are in negative equity and up to their necks in debt with mortgages they cannot afford and in danger of having their houses repossessed.  Many of them are also in vulnerable employment situations.  They already suffer enough stress, financial and otherwise.  I appeal to the Minister not to dismantle what was an innovative provision in terms of child care, all for the sake of a minuscule amount of money in the context of the problems we face.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	710	These resolutions deal with the abolition or phasing out of a batch of reliefs, the abolition of most of which were recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  In general, the Labour Party agrees with the removal of many of those reliefs, particularly in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  However, I have an issue with regard to the abolition of two of the reliefs.  The first is the same one that has been raised by Deputy Creed.  I agree with what he has said on that.  The abolition of the exemption from benefit in kind for employer provided child care is a mistake.  It is a mistake because it will hit a relatively small number of working parents.  The provision of child care in places of employment is something that should be encouraged by the State.  Working parents must go to considerable expense to provide child care and make child care arrangements.  Many parents have to take a child to a child minder, drop another child to school and then get to work on time.  The provision of child care in places of employment is the route we should be taking, particularly for very young children.We should remember that it is not so long ago since we had a problem in this country with regard to maintaining staff in the workforce, particularly working mothers.  Some years ago, much emphasis was placed on the measures that needed to be taken in order to provide adequate child care or incentives and supports for working mothers.   Employers were encouraged to provide dedicated facilities in places of employment.  It is a retrograde and mean step to row back on that provision.  Not only is the amount involved, €6 million in a full year, relatively small but I also do not believe it will be realised.  If the benefit-in-kind is removed, some employers who currently provide child care facilities may decide to discontinue doing so and the elimination of the arrangement will be the tipping point that causes some people to leave the workforce.  As a country, we do not provide much encouragement for working parents, and working mothers in particular, to stay in the workforce.  In many cases, child care is subsidised for parents who are not working, and rightly so.  This exemption to benefit-in-kind helps parents who are working.  It is not a sound argument to claim that only the larger employers offered child care.  We should be trying to encourage more rather than fewer employers to likewise.  I strongly support Deputy Creed on this matter and the Labour Party is opposed to the elimination of this relief.  If necessary, we will oppose the financial resolution on those grounds.The abolition of rent relief will, again, hit working people, and young workers in particular.  Rent relief benefits young people who were frozen out of the housing market.  These are the very people who are at present contemplating whether they will stay in this country or throw in the towel and emigrate.  They are the people who will be affected by the 10% reduction in salaries of new entrants to the public service.  I get e-mails from young graduates who ask me why they should be put on a lower rate of pay when they start working as teachers.  Rent relief applies to people who are at work.  Those who are not at work qualify for rent allowances.The Taoiseach challenged the Labour Party on where we stood in regard to working people.  These two provisions will directly hit working people and will be a disincentive for work.  Many of the young people to whom I speak are starting despair for the future of this country.  On top of cuts in pay and tax measures, the little bit of rent relief they received will now be taken away from them.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	711	Aontaím le cuid mhaith den méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta a labhair romham.  I am surprised the Labour Party Deputy did not mention a third measure in this group of financial resolutions that will hit the working person, namely, the removal of tax relief on trade union subscriptions.  Now is the very time when we should be encouraging those who still have jobs to retain their trade union membership so that they can have proper representation in a time of recession and ensure their pay and conditions are not further undermined.  Removing the relief will make it more expensive to be a member of a trade union, which is a retrograde step.The other two measures only add to the pain this budget will inflict on the working poor, as well as those who have just about been getting by until now.  Employers will be forced to discontinue providing child care facilities.  Tax reliefs were supposed to benefit everybody by encouraging good practices.  Many tax reliefs were, however, introduced to line the pockets of a small number of people in our society.  We lack a system of universal child care which is free or, at least, cheap for young couples who labour under huge mortgages because of the property boom and the shortage of social housing.  They must meet the high costs of child care simply to stay in work and pay their bills.The rent charged on properties in Ireland is higher than in any other European country of which I am aware.  Rent relief was a limited mechanism for those who could not avail of social housing because local authorities were not funded sufficiently.  The budget further reduces the grants paid to local authorities, regeneration projects and social housing initiatives.  People will as a result be forced to remain in rented accommodation but the tax relief they enjoyed to date will now be lost.  We have not seen substantial reductions in rent in all parts of the country.  Rents in Dublin have not decreased at the lower end of the market to the degree that would justify the removal of the relief.The State has not yet ensured that all landlords are properly registered and inspected.  Rent relief would have provided a mechanism to enforce standards among landlords.  Once it is abolished, we will revert to the old practice of paying into the black economy because there will be no need for registration.  These three measures are detrimental to the public good and should be opposed.

Some of them were used in the past for tax avoidance purposes.  These financial resolutions will simplify the tax code and put everybody on an equal footing.  PAYE income is now involved, whether one is paid in shares or patent royalties.  Those who are in a position to put this type of tax avoidance scheme in place should not be favoured.  We are going some way towards improving the situation in that regard and I commend the Minister on that.I take on board what Deputy Gilmore said about benefit-in-kind.  It appears, however, that only larger employers have put these benefits in place.  Other issues have arisen recently with regard to large employers who can give favourable treatment to employees.  The question of the ESB and free electricity is a case in point.  Large employers who are in a position to avoid tax because they have the necessary resources are favoured.  It is unfortunate that some people will now have to pay benefit-in-kind tax on child care, but this is fair and equitable.The Minister stated that abolishing tax relief on trade union subscriptions will save €26 million in a full year.  Some trade union members may pay tax at 41% but I suspect the majority pay at 20%.  Some may not pay tax at all.  This implies an income to trade unions of approximately €130 million per year.  This raises the question of what trade unions do with €130 million.  Should there be more regulation, accountability, transparency and reporting of trade union funds and what they use them for?  Like all well-governed institutions, they should be up-front with their members and with the public.

#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I know of two firms who received several million euro for professional services relating to NAMA.  They are the accountancy firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and solicitors, Arthur Cox.  Will the fees paid by Arthur Cox to the Law Society of Ireland and by PricewaterhouseCoopers to professional accountancy bodies no longer be exempt from tax?  Professional bodies, such as the Law Society of Ireland, often provide services such as continuing professional development courses.  Could one differentiate between fees which support the administration of such bodies and those which are used for education and training?It is unfortunate that a number of people do not claim tax relief on the rent of private property because they do not know about it.  I accept the need to reduce the relief because of the reduction in rents.  This relief should be advertised more widely in order that those who are entitled to it actually get it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I support the remarks made in respect of the Financial Resolution No. 24, especially by Deputies Gilmore and Creed.  I do not know of any other member state of the European Union where a complete 180° flip on public policy could be done overnight.  We are going from an entire system based on tax reliefs and incentives and tax-driven development to a razed earth where they will all be wiped out.  The Minister's reply will be that the Commission on Taxation recommended this.  We are all then supposed to bow the head and accept that we must do it.  It is not as simple as that.  One cannot even ask a Fianna Fáil colleague how long the bad weather will last but he will say: "We appointed Professor Patrick Honohan to the Central Bank, and he is really fantastic.  No one could slur that man.  He is marvellous."

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	721	Many incentives are completely overcooked, have outlasted their productivity and are unwise.  The big ones, such as pension relief and property-based incentives are finally beginning to be dealt with.  The ones we are talking about here, however, are largely Mickey Mouse measures.  The savings are not worth talking about.I understand why people outside this House call for leadership, authority and good example.  We are in no position to contest that call.  It is a reasonable and deserving proposition, but there is also a fair amount of begrudgery around.  Why begrudge parents who happen to work for a good employer who has gone out of his or her way to provide child care in a fashion that qualifies for this exemption from benefit-in-kind tax?  Why do we want to shut them down?  Do we presume they will continue to provide child care if they do not get the tax exemption?  For the sake of €6 million in a full year, I do not see the point of it.I wish the Commission on Taxation had gone down through each of its proposals and said that each should be implemented.  It did not do so.  The commission pointed up certain things and gave background and information regarding individual tax breaks, shelters and incentives, but it was not prescriptive with regard to priorities.I take Deputy Ardagh's point on tax avoidance.  I agree with bringing the transfer of share awards into the PAYE system and making them subject to tax at PAYE rates.  I remember when tax relief for the purchase of new shares in an employing company was introduced.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said this was a great idea designed to encourage industrial peace and good industrial relations in that type of company.  The entire yield from this measure in a full year is €300,000.  It is not long since we were following Mrs. Thatcher's property owning democracy.  Now, everything has to go.  I do not see the point.I refer to Deputy Ardagh's point about the notional income of the trade union movement.  As I understand, the trade unions are regulated by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, if that is still the case.  The trade unions have to produce audited accounts.  However, given the hole we have been landed in, I cannot make an argument to resist the change that is proposed here.  It raises some meaningful income as distinct from something like the new shares purchasing scheme which raises damn all.  People may point to the banks as a good reason for not having such a scheme but that is a different problem.Deputy Gilmore highlighted the rent relief, which will hit a lot of low-paid people very hard.  We are going in one direction with housing policy.  We use tax as an instrument of social policy and then we change direction and go in the opposite direction.  It is a little like the earlier discussion where Deputy Ardagh highlighted the unreasonableness, for example, of the write-down of section 23 reliefs against the section 23 property only.  Not unreasonably, he pointed to examples in his own constituency where the new owner would not be able to pay the interest on the mortgage in return for the amount of rent he or she might get.  That is very probably true but the question it raises is whether this is good housing policy.It seems to me that like this proposal, they were all designed to drive the output of private housing and to transfer our social housing need into private housing and create and expand the need for housing supplement, which is hugely uneconomic and which has produced an entire category of person who is trapped in that apartment because if she goes to work, she loses her housing rental supplement.  There are significant implications, policy-wise and it is now proposed that we reverse engines.Deputy Ó Snodaigh is right in that it is also my experience in my constituency that at the lower end the rents have changed damn all although they have changed at the higher end.  It is now proposed to end on a phased basis the rent relief to match the mortgage interest relief for young people who find themselves housed in these circumstances.  They ended up there because they could not get a mortgage at the time, the price of housing was inordinate at many times their salary.We have moved from one extreme to the other and we are all searching around for where savings can be made to contribute to something like the ball-park figure that is required.  I am not so sure it is good leadership from this House to induce good employers who have gone out of their way to provide child care to either shut it down or to charge for it, or make whatever new arrangement they wish to put in place, no more than it is good industrial relations to kill off the share scheme which was probably minimally subscribed in this country.  There are young workers in that €97 million the Minister hopes to save in a full year who are on the rent relief on that type of housing.  When the sums are being done in The Irish Times tomorrow morning, this should be factored in because it will be a significant factor for many young people who have started work, such as young nurses and teachers.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	723	On a day such as today and in recent times, it is very easy to forget the progress which we have made in recent decades.  It is less than 50 years ago since, for example, a working woman in the public service had to retire on marriage.  I recall that there were very few women in the workplace.  I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 1997 and one of the first acts I had the privilege of performing was to introduce the equal opportunity programme, which provided in excess of €450 million for the provision of child care across the State.It was an equal opportunity measure, the object of the exercise being to provide equality of opportunity, not to discriminate, nor to force anybody to do anything which he or she did not wish to do, but to provide equality of opportunity.  It did that to a large degree.  I accept it could have been better but insofar as the funding was available it was utilised well.  Today, almost an equal number of women as man are in the workplace and this is a very welcome development.  I predict that in a matter of years, there will be a greater number of females in the workplace than males.  It is very important that equality of opportunity be maintained.  The relief is small beer in that context and it is not of massive relevance.  Nonetheless, the support in particular of community child care services is of fundamental importance as we look at the make-up or the components of our workplace today.With regard to the issue of the trade union subscriptions, I greatly support trade unionism and the tradition of Larkin and Connolly.  It would be a very bad day for any democracy were it to be the case that a trade union could not gather lawfully and protest on behalf of its members.  However, I found it ironic and feel obliged to comment on the statement of Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  I agree with the right of people to protest, I agree with trade unionism and I would always defend trade unionists but what I could never defend and what I could never stand over in a democracy is an elected representative of this House going out onto the street with a mob, seeking to break down the gates of Government Buildings to which he is entitled, as a Member of this House, to walk through——

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	726	I will speak on the issue of rent relief.  The Minister proposes to phase out this relief over a period of eight years.  I ask him for an explanation of how this can be achieved.  Does it mean that people will need to remain in singular accommodation over the next eight years or is it aimed at people who are currently in receipt of rent allowance in a multiple of locations over that period?My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte referred to the fact that in the past decade and a half there was significant incentivisation in the property sector where investment properties were prioritised over residential properties.  While this may have been redressed in the budget, it is ironic that those at the bottom end of tax reliefs are the first to face the chop on this issue.  Those in receipt of rent relief are in income limbo.  They are not earning enough to buy a home but they are earning too much to qualify for rent supplement.  This vulnerable group is being targeted.The Minister for Finance indicated that a property price register database would be introduced.  Perhaps it is about time we saw similar reform in the area of rent where we have a rental database and rents are calculated and identified in a more accurate and measurable way.  Reform in this area is long overdue so that rents, as they are in other jurisdictions, are tied to the CPI and other matters.  Ultimately people joining the workforce need to have some level of flexibility which can often mean travelling from one part of the country to another in order to take up work and in doing so not wanting to purchase a home meaning that rents are a critical factor.  I ask the Minister redress the matter.

As part of this process, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) refers persons in receipt of unemployment payments to FÁS for assistance.  NEAP clients are accorded priority in accessing training provided by FÁS Training Services.If a jobseeker is referred to FÁS under the NEAP they must attend the first initial guidance interview.  Depending on their individual needs they may attend for further guidance interviews on a voluntary basis.  EAP clients who do not attend their initial guidance interview are notified to DSP.  For other (non-EAP) jobseekers there is no mandatory requirement to attend interviews.The frequency of interviews depends entirely on the needs of the client.  Some clients may engage with the service only once or twice, while others may attend for interview many times during the course of their progression to employment through numerous interventions.Following interview, clients may be referred to a range of training or employment programmes including Community Employment (CE) and the Work Placement Programme (WPP) or to access job search facilities including Jobs Clubs and self-service facilities.  They may also avail of the Technical Employment Support Grant.

The main focus of those discussions was to ensure that any impact of the school closures on teaching and learning was addressed in an appropriate and sensible manner.  The critical issue was to ensure courses were completed and that at second level the position of examination classes was given particular priority.The position in relation to the recent weather conditions will vary from school to school. My Department's approach during exceptional and widespread adverse weather conditions is that schools should make all reasonable efforts to make up for lost time due to unforeseen school closures.

It is not envisaged, therefore, that further meetings will be required with regard to the realignment process. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a school building project for one of the schools is at an advanced stage of the tender process. Subject to no impediment arising, it is anticipated that the contract for the building project will be awarded in early 2011. A building project is also required at the second school to complete the realignment process. In this context, a site visit by my Department's technical staff was due to take place last week. However, it was not possible to complete the visit due to the adverse weather conditions. A visit will be re-scheduled and my officials will be in contact with the school authority in this regard. The matter is being handled by my Department's Planning and Building Unit.The progression of a building project for this school, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme. In view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	775	It is a key principle, enunciated in the Public Procurement Guidelines, published by the NPPPU, that the public procurement function is discharged honestly, fairly, and in a manner that secures best value for public money. Contracting authorities must be cost effective and efficient in the use of resources while upholding the highest standards of probity and integrity.The Guidelines require a competitive process carried out in an open, objective and transparent manner to achieve best value for money in public procurement.  This is in line with EU Treaty principles and EU Directives on public procurement. The recently published Department of Finance Circular 10/10 was designed to provide small and medium enterprises with a level playing field for competing for public contracts.Essential principles to be observed in conducting all procurement functions include non — discrimination, equal treatment, transparency, mutual recognition, proportionality, freedom to provide service and freedom of establishment. The Directives impose legal obligations on public bodies in regard to advertising and the use of objective tendering procedures for contracts above certain value thresholds. The estimated cost of the project referred to by the Deputy is clearly above the relevant threshold and will require advertisement for tender in the OJEU as well as on the Governments e-tenders website.In common with the rest of the Public Sector, capital works projects in schools are tendered under the standard Public Works Contracts as required by the Department of Finance and the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC). These contracts do not include provisions concerning the employment of local labour.

This funding provided for 82,809 training places (both those who have completed and those currently still in training).
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	777	As part of Budget 2010, the Government announced the creation of a €20 million Labour Market Activation Fund, intended to deliver 3,500 places on training and education programmes for the unemployed.  Its objective was to stimulate innovation in the provision of training and activation measures for jobseekers seeking to up-skill and get back into work. The Fund is being targeted to specific priority groups among the unemployed: the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors — construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35's and the long-term unemployed.On 5th August, an additional allocation of €12 million, financed in part by savings in proposed European Globalisation Fund expenditure, was made available by the Department of Education and Skills, enabling funding to be offered to 33 additional projects. This brought total funding to €32 million for 59 projects proposing to provide up to 12,000 education and training places for the unemployed.  Twenty-six projects providing for over 6,500 education and training places, in all geographical regions, benefited from the initial fund of €20 million.In the main, Phase 1 projects are meeting their interim targets. As of mid-October some 3,441 or 52% of Phase 1 places were already filled, with further courses coming on stream between November 2010 and January 2011. On the basis of current information, it appears that the targets for places to be provided as set out in tenders by projects can be largely met. Thirty-three projects providing for some 5,400 places in all geographic regions benefited from the second tranche of funding allocated in August.  Many projects are still in the process of recruiting participants. It is therefore not possible yet to state the total number of beneficiaries from the Fund.Contractual terms provide for payments to projects in three tranches — 40% on contract signature, 30% six weeks after programme start subject to achievement of interim activity and expenditure targets, and 30% on programme completion subject to achievement of education and training provision contracted for.  As of end November 2010, €14.7 million had been paid to projects.  It is anticipated that by year's end some €18 million will have been drawn from the Fund.  The balance, €14 million, represents the commitment to projects for payments that fall due during 2011, subject to them meeting the delivery terms of the contract.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	778	A total of 477 apprentices were trained under the Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme which operated in 2009. That scheme was replaced in 2010 by the Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme which aims to give redundant apprentices the opportunity to complete on-the-job training phases 3, 5 or 7 to enable them to progress in their apprenticeship. Under the Scheme, FÁS places a redundant apprentice with an approved employer who provides workplace training and assessment at phases 3, 5 or 7. This allows the apprentice to gain the required knowledge, skills and competence in their chosen trade. In order to obtain approval under the Scheme, employers must either be currently employing a registered apprentice or have previously trained a FÁS registered apprentice up to craftsperson status in the past 5 years.  The benefit to the apprentice is that they can successfully progress to the next off-the-job phase of their apprenticeship or complete their apprenticeship.  The benefits to the employer include the availability of an additional staff resource and a FAS employment subsidy of €250 per week for each 39 hour week worked.   To date in 2010 a total of 417 redundant apprentices have participated in the Scheme.

Its purpose is to enhance their prospects of gaining employment or progressing to further or higher education.FÁS provides training services, including the delivery of courses tailored to the needs of jobseekers looking for employment and for those who are in employment, including specially designed training interventions to allow apprentices to qualify as craftspeople.  FÁS also provides employment services, including the delivery of community-based employment and training programmes to allow for accessible learning in local areas, as well as jobsearch facilities, including guidance and resources for jobseekers with access to job vacancies, online CV profiling for employers and effective CV-to-job matching.FÁS and the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA), representing VECs, signed a National Co-operation Agreement in June 2009.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	780	The process of assessing and paying third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.  I am aware that the timing of payment varies between the 66 awarding authorities depending on a number of variables including the volume of applications received, staffing resources and whether or not properly completed application forms have been submitted. Work prioritisation across different functions, and how available staff are deployed to execute those functions are matters for the management of each VEC and local authority concerned.This year's student grant schemes include a number of significant administrative and service improvements aimed at addressing the issue of delay, which include an initial roll-out of a new online grant application system. The new system, introduced in both Irish and English, is already operating in 11 grant awarding authorities. Building on this initial phase for the current academic year, the ultimate aim will be to make it available to all applicants nationally.Key among the other improvements introduced are a complete overhaul of the grant application form, streamlined administrative processes, advance payments to awarding authorities and publication of the grant schemes some two months earlier than last year.The Student Support Bill, which will provide for a fundamental and radical restructuring of the whole student grants administration function and provide for a single unified scheme is now listed to be taken at Report stage on 16 December 2010.The table details the number of new student grant applications received, awarded, refused, on-going, cancelled, yet to be processed, transferred and the number paid by the local authorities and Vocational Educational Committees for the 2010/11 academic year up to the week ended 3 December 2010 unless otherwise stated.  The information has been supplied to my  Department by the local authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.My Department is in constant contact with grant awarding authorities to monitor the situation in relation to the processing and payment of student grants.  It recently wrote, on my behalf, to the heads of the grant awarding authorities to inform them that I am anxious to ensure that remaining applicants receive decisions on their grant applications as soon as possible and requesting their  co-operation in prioritising this work in their Councils/Committees.Local AuthoritiesNumber of New ApplicationsAwardedRefusedOngoing/ Further Information or Documentation RequestedCancelled/ WithdrawnYet to be processedTransferredPaidCarlow Co.

As such it is a matter for sub-contractors to agree terms and conditions for payment with the main contractor or other sub-contractors.However, the issue raised by the Deputy has come to the Government's attention previously. As the Deputy will be aware, legislation on the matter is currently before the Upper House. In addition, a consultation process between the Department of Finance and the relevant industry and professional bodies has taken place to explore the legal, technical and procedural issues surrounding the regulating of payment and certain other matters under construction contracts and to provide for related matters. My Department has contributed to this consultation process and is supportive of the overall objectives.With regard to contracts being awarded to contractors from outside the State, the Deputy will be aware that under national and EU procurement rules, companies from other Member States are entitled to tender for public competitions in Ireland. Similar protections apply for Irish companies seeking to tender for public competitions in other Member States.

New senior professional staff cannot avail of flexi-time but other new staff may work up a maximum number of 7 flexi days per annum, subject to local business needs.

The surplus is the total income from lottery sales after deduction of prizes and allowable costs.  The surplus for each of the years 2007 to 2009 is as follows:2007:  €245m;2008:  €268m;2009:  €264mSection 5 of the National Lottery Act 1986 provides that the surplus from the National Lottery may be used for the following purposes: sport and other recreation; national culture, including the Irish Language; the arts, within the meaning of the Arts Act 1951; the health of the community; and for such other purposes as the Government may determine. The following additional categories have been so determined: youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.In order to give effect to this statutory provision, the surplus form the National Lottery is transferred to the Exchequer on a regular basis and is applied to each year to part-fund the Exchequer allocations to a specified range of expenditure subheads across various Votes. Since 2005, the allocations for the relevant subheads exceed the amount available from the National Lottery surplus. Each year, the amount transferred to the Exchequer form the National Lottery surplus, together with details of the total Exchequer allocations to the relevant subheads are set out in Appendix 1 of the annual "Revised Estimates for Public Services".

If a main contractor goes into liquidation before a State body has fully paid for work done then Company Law dictates that the debt is still due but is payable to the liquidator, who has specific obligations under Company Law about how to handle the various assets and liabilities of the liquidated Company.For as long as a public body is still obliged to pay the liquidator for any amounts it owes to a main contractor, then any other action could have adverse consequences for the taxpayer. Therefore it would not be appropriate to put in place arrangements for direct payment to subcontractors.Senator Feargal Quinn's Construction Contracts Bill 2010 is currently before the Seanad.  It seeks to provide some remedy for construction sector subcontractors who are unpaid for work done.  The Government has been working closely with the Senator to bring his proposals into an effective scheme without exposing the taxpayer to further costs or risks.  This is a complex area.  The Bill will be progressing shortly.

This includes foreign exchange instruments, interest rate instruments and other hedging arrangements.  Anglo is the only institution that has availed of such a guarantee.    As with all banks, Anglo Irish Bank is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties in the normal course of its business activities. These risks include market risk (arising from Anglo's exposures to interest rate and currency movements). Derivatives are used by Anglo Irish Bank solely for the management of these risks and are not entered into for any speculative purposes. The bank's balance sheet exposure to these risks taken together with the risk mitigation provided by these derivatives are managed within risk limits which are approved by the bank's board of directors.Anglo Irish Bank had recently indicated to the authorities that owing to the bank's financial situation and recent ratings actions their derivative counter parties required the provision of such a guarantee for such transactions with the bank. The ELG does not cover such liabilities.The situation was reviewed by the NTMA who, based on the bank's concerns, recommended to me that the guarantee should be put in place given the financial issues the bank was currently experiencing. The Governor of the Central Bank was also consulted and the Central Bank confirmed it was agreeable to such a guarantee to help manage Anglo's balance sheet risks.Under the terms of the guarantee package, Anglo management must continue to manage these derivative positions within pre-approved risk limits approved by the bank's board of directors.It was concluded that it was important to avoid exposure to serious operational risks in the bank which could potentially arise without the continued support of the counter parties.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	802	Information provided by the covered institutions in respect of covered liabilities guaranteed under CIFS related to senior unsecured debt in aggregate, a category that comprised medium-term notes and other senior debt such as commercial paper and certificates of deposits. The total amount of senior unsecured debt as at 30 September 2008 was in the region of €124 billion. A further €12 billion of dated subordinated debt was also guaranteed under CIFS at that date. Senior bonds and subordinated bonds to the value of €68.8 billion and €1.4 billion, respectively, matured and were redeemed at face value between 30 September 2008 and 29 September 2010. As is normal practice when bonds mature they are repaid, in this instance all were senior bonds and all were Government Guaranteed. Furthermore, under Irish law senior debt obligations rank equally with deposits and other creditors.  I would like to remind the Deputy that subordinated debt is not an eligible liability under the terms of the ELG Scheme, and therefore no subordinated debt has been issued to date under that Scheme.  Senior medium term notes amounting to €25 billion have been issued under the ELG scheme to-date — further detail on this number is disclosed on the NTMA website — www.ntma.ie. None of the medium term notes issued under the scheme have matured to-date. Much of the short- term senior debt issued under the ELG Scheme (i.e. commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit (CD)) will have, due to its nature, rolled over frequently, and it would not be either practical or meaningful to quantify amounts that have matured. Further detail on all CP and CD programmes certified under the ELG Scheme is also disclosed on the NTMA website — www.ntma.ie . Finally, owing to commercial sensitivities, my Department does not publish details of unguaranteed debt issued by participating institutions, and does not publish covered liabilities by institution.

These charges include fees for items such as terminal rental, customer services, and dispute resolution services.  They are a function of and are determined by the interchange fees set by the payment card schemes for the participating acquirers.  Interchange fees are paid by the merchant's acquirer to the cardholder's bank every time a payment card is used.  For debit cards, it is usually a small flat fee.  While interchange fee levels vary depending on the type of payment card, the purpose is to reflect the real operating costs.The European Commission's sectoral inquiry into retail banking in 2005 and 2006 found that interchange fee agreements in place at the time had the potential to act as an obstacle to a more cost-efficient payment cards industry and to the creation of a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The European Commission subsequently launched anti-trust investigations against the interchange fees charged by the two largest international card issuers within the European Union. These investigations resulted in reduced interchange fees being put in place by both companies.As Minister for Finance, I do not have any role in the regulation of such fees as they are a commercial matter between the given card scheme, the acquirer and their customers, however a list of interchange fees set by the international card schemes is available on those schemes' websites, as required by the European Central Bank.

The main reason that bonds are not guaranteed under the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme 2009 (the "ELG Scheme") is that senior bonds issued prior to an institution joining the ELG Scheme are not guaranteed under the Scheme.In addition, the ELG Scheme allows participating institutions to issue unguaranteed liabilities, although the amounts under this provision are relatively small to date.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	805	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information for the Clonmel area specifically is not available year-on-year for the period since 2005.  Previous to the introduction, by the Revenue Commissioners, of a new improved IT system for excise licensing in 2008, this information was not retained in a format suitable to provide the detailed local information requested.  There have also been changes to and merging of District Court areas in Clonmel, Nenagh and Thurles over the past number of years and this would distort any direct comparisons.  The current number of live Publican's Licence (7-Day Ordinary) associated to Clonmel District Court area is 217.However, the information, by licensing year, as it relates to County Tipperary is as follows:YearNumber2010**44320094472008467200747320064972005524*Pubs:  refers to ordinary pubs only, and does not include hotels with public bars, ordinary hotels (hotels that do not have a bar as such but which can serve drinks to residents on a tray), theatres, greyhound race tracks, or railway refreshment rooms.**2010: refers to renewals for 2010 year to date.

The moratorium allows for certain general exemptions in the Education and Health Sectors for the filling of certain key posts as well as for the Local Authorities in relation to certain key posts.  Information in relation to the posts covered by these general exemptions may be sought from the relevant Ministers.Departments have been implementing the moratorium in respect of themselves and the bodies under their aegis. However, where a Department feels that a post should be filled, in either the case of a civil service post or in relation to a public service post in a body under the aegis of the Department, it requires the sanction of the Minister for Finance for an exception to the moratorium.  Requests for exceptions are not made in respect of every vacancy.The most recent round of monitoring on the exceptions granted to the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in both the Civil and Public Service was conducted in September 2010. This information is collected in a standard format and full details are outlined in table 1 and table 2. Information is not collected on the cost of individual posts sanctioned.  The next round of monitoring will be conducted at the end of quarter 4 2010.Each request for an exception is assessed on a case by case basis. Approval to fill posts is based on the business case made including consideration of, for example:a. statutory posts which have to be filled for legal reasons;b. in a number of instances failure to fill posts could result in a breach of EU/international regulations etc.;c. safety related posts where a failure to fill them could leave the state open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons;d. some specialist/technical posts which are required to ensure continuity of operations e.g. legal officers; laboratory staff,    maritime safety, etc.;e. to ensure continuity of essential services.It should be noted that in accordance with the terms of the moratorium, exceptions can only be sought by Government Departments and Offices after all internal possibilities of reassigning staff, reorganising work, etc. have been exhausted.  In addition, as part of the Employment Control Framework 2010-2012 for the Health Sector, the HSE has discretion to fill a limited number of posts on exceptional grounds to support the development of integrated health care and its transformation programme. There must be suppression of posts of equivalent value in non-frontline areas for each new exempted posts or each exception made.  Information on the individual exceptions sought by each Department in respect of Civil Service and Public Service posts is outlined in table 1 and table 2, respectively.  Unless otherwise stated in the tables the information covers the period up to the 1st of September 2010.Civil ServiceTable 1 sets out the breakdown of exceptions to the moratorium which have been sought in respect of the Civil Service.  Approximately 2,800 staff have left the Civil Service since the introduction of the moratorium in March 2009. Exceptions have been sought to fill 1,969 posts and of these 1,247 have been approved either in full or in part. However, only some 520 of these posts will in time involve recruitment of new staff.  During this period the net reduction in civil service numbers has been 2,300, representing a decrease of some 6% on numbers serving numbers in the civil service.  In addition sanction has also been given for some 276 temporary posts for Census 2011 and for various temporary ‘summer relief' type posts.Dept / Office TitleException Sought1

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	808	The tax exemption for patent income has been in place for over 30 years and has applied to income received by an individual or company from a qualifying patent subject, since 2008, to an annual limit of €5 million. A tax exemption has also applied, subject to certain conditions, to distributions paid by companies from exempt patent income. These exemptions have been abolished with effect from 24 November 2010.   I do not believe that the removal of this relief will have a significant adverse effect on investment and innovation. The decision to abolish the relief was taken on the basis of a recommendation to this effect by the Commission on Taxation. The Commission found that the relief has not had the desired impact on innovation and R&D activity and that, despite various refinements to the scheme over the years, it was not a particularly well-targeted measure providing good value for money. Abolition of the patent income exemption will yield €50 million to the Exchequer in a full year and this is provided for in the National Recovery Plan.As part of its review all tax expenditures, the Commission on Taxation examined the relief for patent income to determine if its continued operation was justified on cost benefit grounds. The Commission concluded that the relief has not resulted to any great extent in companies carrying out R&D activity and that the relief was being used in some cases by companies as a tax avoidance device to remunerate employees. Indeed, changes have had to be made to the scheme over the years to counter abuses as they have arisen.  The Commission considered that there was a significant deadweight element to the relief and that it provided a windfall gain after a successful invention rather than an incentive to encourage new research and development.The Government agrees with the conclusions of the Commission and believes that scarce resources should be focussed instead on the R&D tax credit scheme. The R&D credit scheme provides a more direct and effective incentive for enterprises to innovate and invest in R&D activities and the scheme has been enhanced considerably in recent years to make it one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere.A tax credit of 25% of the incremental expenditure incurred by a company in an accounting period on R&D activities can be offset against a company's corporation tax liability.  The scheme has been improved in most Budgets and Finance Acts since its introduction in 2004.Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 contained a number of very significant enhancements to the R&D tax credit scheme including;An option to carry-back unused tax credits for set-off against  a company's previous year's corporation tax payments, if there is insufficient corporate tax liability in the current year, thereby creating a tax refund.A further option, if unused tax credits still remain, to claim payment of the remaining unused credits which will be paid in instalments over a 3 year period.Some of the expenditure on new or refurbished buildings used in part for R&D purposes will qualify for a tax credit, subject to a minimum level of R&D taking place there over a period.The National Recovery Plan contains measures that will impact on all sections of Irish society. The abolition of the tax exemption for patent income would be less damaging to Ireland's competitiveness than, for example, an increase in the 12.5% corporation tax rate and the removal of the exemption is, perhaps, best seen in that light.

The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission — who control and manage the Fund — publish a report on the performance of the NPRF at the end of each quarter, as well as the annual reports of the Commission, on the Commission's website www.nprf.ie/home.html .  The most recent quarterly report, to 30 September 2010, valued the Fund at €24.5 billion. A breakdown of income and expenditure of the National Pensions Reserve Fund over the past five years as detailed in the annual reports of the Commission from 2005 to 2009 is set out as follows.20052006200720082009Opening Balance11,68915,41918,90021,15316,142Exchequer Contributions1,3201,4461,6161,6903,993*Investment Return2,4342,064661(6,676)2,222Total Expenses(24)(29)(24)(25)(22)Closing Balance15,41918,90021,15316,14222,335*Including €993 million in assets transferred from university and non-commercial semi-state pension funds.The Government announced on 28 November 2010 that it had agreed in principle to the provision of€85 billion of financial support to Ireland by Member States of the European Union through the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Financial Stability Mechanism; bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark; and the International Monetary Fund's Extended Fund Facility on the basis of specified conditions.The State's contribution to the €85 billion facility will be €17½ billion, which will come from the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) and other domestic cash resources.  This means that the extent of the external assistance will be reduced to €67½ billion.The purpose of the external financial support is to return our economy to sustainable growth and to ensure that we have a properly functioning, healthy banking system. We have agreed to use resources available to us to make our own contribution to the programme. The Programme for the Recovery of the Banking System will be an intensification of the measures already adopted by the Government.  The programme provides for a fundamental downsizing and reorganisation of the banking sector so it is proportionate to the size of the economy.  It will be capitalised to the highest international standards and in a position to return to normal market sources of funding, and it is appropriate that we should play our part in this through the National Pensions Reserve Fund.In relation to fiscal policy and structural reform, the Programme for Support endorses the Government's budgetary adjustment plan of €15 billion over the next four years and the structural reforms contained in the National Recovery Plan which will underpin a return to sustainable economic growth over the coming years. The NPRF's commitment to infrastructure development as outlined in the National Recovery Plan is unaffected by the Fund's contribution to the financial support package.

The general position is that books are zero rated, newspapers and periodicals are subject to the reduced rate and stationery and other printed matter are liable at the standard rate.   The zero rate applies to printed books including atlases, children's picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music.  The reduced rate applies to newspapers and periodicals including sectoral publications (sports, fashion, etc.), holiday brochures, prospectuses, catalogues and maps.  The standard rate applies to wide range of goods including stationery, calendars, greeting cards, diaries, yearbooks and posters.  All digitised publication regardless of their rate when printed (for example, a book liable at zero rate) are treated as a supply of a service liable at the standard rate.  Printed matter that is purchased via download over the internet is also considered a service liable for VAT at the standard rate.I have no immediate plans to change the VAT treatment of books.  However, as stated in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, it is the Government's intention to examine further rebalancing of the VAT system and zero rated VAT items within the context of wider and ongoing EU level consideration of the matter.  The VAT system is continually being reviewed at EU level and Ireland is part of that process.

These supports include the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by the Money Advice Budgeting Services.The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitments under the Renewed Program for Government for introducing new measures to protect families having difficulties with their mortgage repayments and personal indebtedness under the headings Protecting the Family Home and Helping Those in Debt .  Since the publication of the Renewed Programme for Government in October 2009 I have taken a number of steps to improve the position for such homeowners.In my Budget speech in December 2009 the Government refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at the peak of the market, many of whom find themselves in negative equity.  Where a homeowner's entitlement to mortgage interest relief would expire in 2010 or after, they will now continue to receive it up to the end of 2017. In addition at my request the Financial Regulator after consideration extended the moratorium on mortgage arrears from 6 months to 12 months for all mortgage lenders with effect from 17 February 2010.The Deputy will also be aware that on 25 February 2010, I announced the establishment of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group (Group), under the chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney an insolvency accountant. The Group was charged with making recommendations to me on options for improving the current situation for families with mortgage arrears on their principal private residence and with personal debt.Since then the Group submitted an Interim Report to me in early July and their Final Report in mid November. Both reports can be accessed on the Department of Finance's website at www.finance.gov.ie .The Reports when combined include key recommendations to address the issues of communication between householders in arrears and their lenders, and the need for a more consistent assessment process by lenders of borrowers in difficulty in the form of an industry-wide Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) including a range of forbearance measures.  A Deferred Interest Scheme is also recommended for borrowers who can pay at least 66% of the interest, giving them additional time to get back on their feet.Now that the recommendations of the Group have been published and noted by the Government, the task now is for lenders and the Financial Regulator to work closely together to ensure they are implemented. This process is well underway. A revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears by the Central Bank has just been published, with my approval, which underpins many of the Group's recommendations.I am confident that the steps that I have taken in keeping with Government's commitments under the Renewed Programme for Government together with the existing Government supports will improve the situation for homeowners in difficulty with mortgage arrears and personal debt.

I am interpreting public bodies in accordance with the definitions set out in the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and the information in respect of those bodies under the remit of my Department is set out as follows.TheSpecial EU Programmes Body   (SEUPB) is committed to ensuring that all payments are made to suppliers on a prompt basis. Payments are issued to suppliers on a weekly basis and therefore no monies are owed to private firms by the SEUPB by the close of each working week.TheState Laboratory   abides by the relevant legislation and Government policies regarding prompt payment for goods and services supplied by private sector organisations. The average time taken to pay invoices is 5 days, which is well within the Government policy objective of payment within 15 days and the usual period of credit allowed by suppliers.TheOffice of the Comptroller and Auditor General   abides by the relevant legislation regarding prompt payment for goods and services supplied by private sector organisations. Supplies that are in order and that have been invoiced in accordance with agreed arrangements are paid as quickly as possible. At present in the Office, invoices with a value of €18,332.82 are being processed for payment by 8 December 2010.In respect of theOffice of the
Commission for Public Service Appointments  , with the exception of current invoices, all of which will be paid in accordance with prompt payment policy, this is a nil reply from this office.TheOffice of the Ombudsman   meets with the Government policy objective of making payment to suppliers within 15 days in that regard no monies are owed to private firms.ThePublic Appointments Service   abides by the relevant legislation and Government policies regarding prompt payment for goods and services supplied by private sector organisations. Supplies that are in order and that have been invoiced in accordance with agreed arrangements are generally paid within the Government policy objective of payment within 15 days and the usual period of credit allowed by suppliers. In that sense, therefore, no amount of money is owed to private firms as of 3rd December.TheValuation Office   abides by the relevant legislation and Government policies regarding prompt payment for goods and services supplied by private sector organisations. Supplies that are in order and that have been invoiced in accordance with agreed arrangements are paid comfortably within the Government policy objective of payment within 15 days and the usual period of credit allowed by suppliers. In that sense, therefore, no amount of money is owed to private firms.I am informed by theOffice of the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Appeals Commissioners   that they abide by the relevant legislation and Government policies regarding prompt payment for goods and services supplied by private sector organisations. Supplies that are in order and that have been invoiced in accordance with agreed arrangements are paid promptly and over 99% of all invoices are paid within 15 days of receipt.  The very small number of invoices falling outside this figure relates to cases where further information was required before payment could be made. In that sense, therefore, no money is owed to private firms.TheOffice of Public Works   abides by the relevant legislation and Government policies regarding prompt payment for goods and services supplied by private sector organisations. Supplies that are in order and that have been invoiced in accordance with agreed arrangements are paid promptly.The table shows that in the quarter Jul-Sept 2010 66% of payments were made within the Government policy objective of payment within 15 days and 33% were paid within 16-30 days the usual period of credit allowed by suppliers. These statistics are also indicative for the current period.DetailsNumberValuePercentage (%) of total payments made€Total payments made in Quarter21,971105,792,368.27(100%)Number of payments made within 15 days14,43298,438,071.34(65.68%)Number of payments made within 16 days to 30 days7,2196,928,836.94(32.86%)Number of payments made in excess of 30 days320425,459.99(1.45%)Disputed Invoices  Included above167

VAT is an EU-wide tax and Irish VAT law must comply with the EU VAT Directives.  Article 78 of EU Council Directive 2006/112/EC provides that the taxable amount shall include "taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself".Accordingly, it is correct to include any carbon tax element of a utility bill in the amount on which VAT is chargeable.  The same situation applies in the case of other excises, including for example excises on petrol, auto-diesel, tobacco and alcohol products.Guidance in relation to the VAT treatment of the total consideration receivable by a supplier is set out in the VAT Guide.  This publication is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie .
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The annual earnings limit which (along with age-related percentage limits) determine the maximum tax-relievable contributions for pension purposes that an individual taxpayer can make in any year is being set at €115,000 for 2011 as compared with the limit of €150,000 for 2010.    The annual earnings and age-related percentage limits apply to all contributions made by an employee, whether in the public or private sector, to an occupational pension scheme, including additional voluntary contributions, and to contributions made by individuals to personal pension plan arrangements such as Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs). These limits do not apply to employer contributions except in the case of PRSAs.While contribution-based controls have historically applied in the case of  RACs and PRSAs, controls based on maximum allowable benefits apply in the case of occupational pension schemes. The main control that applies in that regard is that the maximum retirement benefit that can be funded for a scheme member cannot exceed two-thirds of the individual's final remuneration. A separate life-time tax relieved pension fund limit (the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT) currently set at €5.4 million is also in place and where the capital value of a two-thirds pension would otherwise exceed that amount a punitive tax charge applies to the excess. The SFT applies regardless of the type of pension fund arrangement and, as mentioned in the National Recovery Plan, the SFT is being reduced. Details of the reduction will be outlined in today's Budget documentation.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	822	The full year saving from reducing income tax relief to the standard rate on contributions by employees and individuals to supplementary pension saving is estimated at about €500 million. As indicated in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, this estimate does not take account of the behavioural impact which would be likely to result from a change of this magnitude.   The Deputy posits the view, in this regard, that a gradual reduction in the tax relief will encourage individuals to maximise their pension contributions in the coming years thus reducing the savings to the Exchequer.  On the other hand, alternative views have been expressed to the effect that as pension savings and the tax relief arrangements for those savings represent deferred income and deferred taxation, the proposed changes in tax relief may discourage pension savings. The argument in this case is that individuals liable to tax at the higher income tax rate, including those on modest incomes, may consider that it would not be in their interest to continue to make contributions at a gradually reducing rate of tax relief if there is a risk that the pension income they will ultimately secure from those contributions might be taxed at a higher rate, notwithstanding that this would not be the outcome for many of those affected. Clearly it is difficult to predict what the behavioural impact of the changes is likely to be.The National Recovery Plan recognises the potential disincentive effect on supplementary pension provision and for this reason the Government has indicated its willingness to engage with the pensions industry to examine potential alternative approaches to securing the quantum of savings from pension tax expenditures set out in the Plan.

I answered the Parliamentary Questions tabled on behalf of fellow Ministers in relation to the Croke Park Agreement as my Department prepared the overall Civil Service and State Agency Action Plan, the contents of which apply to all Departments. This plan was based upon the action plans submitted by each Government Department to my Department.   The Implementation Body has now reviewed and approved the Civil Service and State Agency Sectoral Plan.  All Departments/Offices were requested to publish their local Action Plan on their website.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	825	There are two main factors associated with medical cards and GP visit cards, firstly the capitation and other fees paid to General Practitioners (GPs) and, secondly, the cost of drugs supplied to patients.GPs who hold contracts under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme with the Health Service Executive (HSE) are remunerated through a range of fees and payments, most of which were amended in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2009, which came into effect on 7th July 2009.  Included among these fees are more than 50 different capitation fees, which vary depending on the age and gender of the patient and the distance he or she lives from the GP's surgery.  For example, fees currently range from €76.98 for a male patient under 5 years living 3 miles or less from the GP's surgery to €218.37 for a female aged 65-70 years living more than 10 miles from the surgery.  In addition, there are special capitation rates of €280.31 for persons aged 70 and over residing at home and €896.07 for persons aged 70 and over residing in private nursing homes. There is also a range of additional payments; for example, in respect of out-of-hours consultations, temporary residents, special items of services (e.g. suturing), panel size, practice support allowances and locum expenses.As regards the supply of drugs and medicines, effective from 1st October 2010, medical card holders will only have to pay a prescription charge of 50 cent per item subject to a maximum of €10 per month for each person or family.  GP visit card holders avail of the Drugs Payment Scheme, which now involves a co-payment of the first €120 spent per family in any calendar month.  Drugs costs vary significantly depending on the patient's medical condition.My Department has been in contact with the HSE in relation to the average cost of a medical card per annum and the Executive has indicated that, given there were 1,598,823 medical card holders and 114,106 GP visit card holders on the 1st November, 2010, the variety of payment arrangements and the variation in drug costs under the GMS Scheme, a single average annual cost figure in respect of the medical card and GP visit card is not a sufficiently refined measure for policy options and decisions.The estimated total expenditure in 2009 on the GMS Scheme was approximately €1.85 billion.  The HSE Service Plan for 2010 shows the projected cost of the GMS Scheme this year as €2.032 billion.  The Service Plan also shows a projected increase in medical card and GP visit card numbers of 144,000 and 16,111 respectively for 2010.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 to 92, inclusive, together.I recently met with Patient Focus in the context of the Report of the Drogheda Review, prepared by Mr. T. C. Smyth.The Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme was established following an Inquiry into peripartum hysterectomy at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. The Inquiry was chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark S.C.Judge Clark was requested by the Government to advise on an appropriate scheme of redress arising from the findings of the Report.  Having received Judge Clark's advice, the Government approved the establishment of a non-statutory ex gratia scheme of redress in 2007, and appointed Judge Clark as its chairperson.The Lourdes Hospital Inquiry did not extend to a wider examination of Mr. Neary's general practice or the clinical practice of his colleagues. However, Judge Clark became aware during the course of the inquiry that some patients of Mr. Neary had undergone bilateral oophorectomies — that is, the removal of both ovaries or a single remaining ovary — that may not have been clinically warranted. The inquiry also received medical reports from women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy with relatively little evidence that the procedures were warranted.Judge Clark took advice on a selection of oophorectomy cases involving younger women treated by Mr. Neary. She was advised that while it is sometimes necessary to remove both ovaries in the presence of serious disease, the occasion of such a radical procedure is not common. This led her to conclude that unwarranted oophorectomies performed by Mr. Neary on women aged under 40 be included within the scope of the Redress Scheme.  The Scheme was advertised on 14th June 2007.The Lourdes Hospital Redress Board has now concluded its work and all awards determined have been notified to successful applicants.I was asked to consider an extension of the scope of the Scheme to include additional former patients of Mr. Neary outside of the terms of the Scheme.  I gave due consideration to the request and consulted with Judge Clark in the matter, who advised against an extension. Acting on this advice,  I decided against an extension of the Scheme and this was publicly communicated in November 2008.The Government believes that the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme addressed the matter in as sensitive and timely a manner as possible.  It was always the Government's intention that the women who qualified for the Scheme would receive adequate recompense and I believe that has been achieved in a fair and reasonable manner.

As the Deputy is aware, a range of services are available to support older people living in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and where this is not possible, provide them with access to appropriate residential accommodation.I would like to point out that housing policy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. A sub-group of the cross-departmental team on sheltered housing, established by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government to oversee progress in that area, has produced a draft protocol for inter-agency co-operation where there is a care dimension additional to accommodation needs. Representatives from my Department, the HSE, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the local authorities and the Irish Council for Social Housing participated on the subgroup. A draft protocol has been submitted to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for further consideration by the cross departmental team.

I understand that the Dublin Dental School and Hospital is preparing to introduce a course which will provide training to a level sufficient to allow for registration with the Dental Council.

The charges are subject to a cap of €10 per month for each person or family. Based on trends in previous years, it is expected that the prescription charges will yield approximately €24 million in a full year, or about €2 million per month.

The second phase of the HPV vaccination programme is now underway.  During this calendar year, all girls currently in second year and those who entered first year in September are being offered vaccination.  The programme will continue with the vaccine being offered to all girls in first year in secondary school each year.  It is not proposed to extend the vaccination programme to other classes at present.Unfortunately, it will not be possible to refund the costs of vaccinations administered privately.

My Department is assigning additional resources to this task over the coming weeks to speed up the completion of this commitment.I appreciate the importance attached to this documentation by the Irish survivors of thalidomide but I would point out that the process must be thorough. The process is also very time consuming due to the nature and scale of the documentation and the level of redaction of personal information required to comply with data protection requirements.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	856	The work of the Steering Group on a Value for Money and Policy Review of  the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Disability Services in Ireland chaired by Mr Laurence Crowley, is still in progress. Substantial progress has been made on the Review:A public consultation process was undertaken in late 2009 and attracted almost 200 responses from a wide variety of respondents including service users, family members and service providers.  A detailed report on the findings of this process was published on the Department's website on 3rd December 2010.In order to inform the work of the VFM Review, an Expert Reference Group (ERG) was established to review current policy on disability services.  The work of that Group has been completed   and on 3rd December last I also published the key proposals emerging from the work of the ERG for consideration and discussion.  It is expected that a formal public consultation on the full report of the ERG will take place in the first half of 2011.The National Disability Authority (NDA), at the request of the ERG, conducted 15 focus group consultations with people with disabilities, their families, advocates and frontline service providers in March 2010 to inform its advice to the Review. The report of that consultation has been published on the NDA's website, as too has a detailed Advice Paper prepared by the NDA incorporating the results of the consultation together with other relevant research conducted on behalf of the VFM Steering Group.While substantial progress has been made on the Review some slippage has occurred in terms of the expected completion date because of the breadth and complexities of the services under examination. Difficulties were also experienced earlier this year in accessing data essential to the progress of the Review due to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive. I expect the Value for Money Steering Group to conclude its work by the second quarter of 2011 and to furnish its final report shortly thereafter.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	857	On 1 November 2010 I announced that the Government had approved a voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme and a voluntary redundancy (VR) scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service.  The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.I understand from information provided by the HSE that there were 3,596 applications from eligible grades by the closing date of 19 November 2010.  I also understand that of that total 2,310 were from the Management/Administration category while the balance of 1,286 was from the General Support category.  A total of 2,586 eligible applications were received from HSE employees.  The breakdown on a HSE area basis is as follows:Dublin Mid Leinster: 468;Dublin North East: 494;West: 840;South: 760;Not linked: 24.It should be noted that the information on the number of applications is still provisional as the data is currently being validated by HSE.  Based on the Census return for the end September 2010 the total number of employees in the Management/Administration category is 19,778 while the General Support category accounts for 13,871 individuals.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	858	On 1 November 2010 I announced that the Government had approved a voluntary early retirement scheme and a voluntary redundancy scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service. The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform. The Government had agreed that up to €400m could be made available to fund the costs of the schemes in 2010 and this was the upper limit based on an upper estimate of 4,500 to 5,000 applications.I am happy to report that there was a good level of interest in the schemes. By the closing date of 19 November, there were approximately 3,500 applications from eligible grades. The cost of the schemes will depend on the numbers who actually decide to go, and while I do not have final information on that number yet, I do not expect the cost to be more than €250m.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	859	The re-hiring staff of who have availed of either the Voluntary Early Retirement or Voluntary Redundancy schemes is clearly not allowed under the terms of these schemes.  It is a specific condition of the VER scheme that those availing of the scheme will not be eligible for re-employment in the public health sector or in the wider public service or in a body wholly or mainly funded from public monies.  The same condition on re-employment applies under the Voluntary Redundancy Scheme also, except that the prohibition will be for a period of 7 years, after which time any re-employment will require the approval of the Minister for Finance.  These restrictions also apply in the case of re-engagement on a contract for service, which would include coming back on a consultancy basis.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	867	A critical part of the strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it is necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers, including the number of nurses and midwives, over the coming years.This policy is reflected in the Employment Control Framework for the health sector and in the National Recovery Plan which provides for an ongoing reduction of 1,500 wholetime equivalents per annum over the period 2011 to 2014.The Government decision in relation to the Framework has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people, persons with a disability, mental health services, and cancer services.In addition, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has some degree of flexibility under the Framework to sanction the filling of certain other posts (both within its own organisation and in voluntary service providers funded it by it) on an exceptional basis provided it achieves the overall target reductions in both staffing levels and pay costs.With regard to the HSE's use of agency nurses, the Chief Executive Officer has acknowledged the need to address this.  Accordingly, I have referred the matter to the Executive for direct reply.

An additional allocation of €50m is dependent on the proceeds of disposals of surplus properties.  Gross capital expenditure as at 30 November is estimated at €318m.    The HSE is anticipating a full uptake of its allocation for building, equipping and furnishing of health facilities.  There are savings of €30m on the ICT allocation which are required to fund higher than anticipated expenditure on State Claims payments and payments under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act with the balance of approximately €12m being surrendered to the Exchequer.As the management and delivery of the health capital programme is a service matter for the Health Service Executive, it will provide details of the overall expenditure as at 30 November 2010 and the project allocation and expenditure.

Any change to the Regulations would need to be legislatively provided for through either primary or secondary legislation.  Any such legislation would be a matter for the Minister for Health and Children or a Minister of State authorised to act on his or her behalf.

In carrying out an inspection and determining whether there is a suitable degree of compliance with the regulatory requirements, or whether steps need to be taken to address any shortfall, the professional judgement of the Inspector will be applied, however, this does not include any discretion in regard to the intention of the Regulations.

These groups are working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas having regard to local public transport service needs and the availability of resources.The provision of services under the RTP is a matter for the individual rural transport groups. Local communities know where the transport needs are in their areas and how best to address them.  My Department's role is one of facilitator through financial and administrative support, but communities themselves have the lead role in developing the transport services to fulfil these needs.

The National Recovery Plan which was launched on the 24th November 2010 provides revised capital budgets for my Department over the Plan period 2011-2014.The new allocations mean that it will not now be possible to meet the original timeline for all T21 projects. However no project has been cancelled and planning and design will continue so that projects can commence as funding becomes available.Under the plan there is provision for initial planning and design for Phase 2 of the Western Rail Corridor.Further progress will be dependent on a review of the performance of Phase 1 and a full economic assessment of Phase 2.In this regard my Department has received an application for funding from Iarnród Éireann for the detailed design and tender preparation stage for Phase 2, Athenry to Tuam, which is currently under consideration.

In order to keep the business on a sustainable footing, the company must reduce its cost base, a substantial portion of which is staff costs.    The company has been engaging with its employees and their representatives over the past two years, and this process has involved the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. A voluntary redundancy offer has recently concluded and the company is considering what further measures may be required.My Department and I have been kept apprised of the situation throughout this process as part of the regular communications that take place between the company and shareholder. However, the matter is primarily an operational one for the company, in which I have no function.The Croke Park Agreement is not applicable to the Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company as it does not apply to commercial State bodies.

With regard to the PSO programme in general, the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (An Bórd Snip) recommended that the Public Service Obligations for air services should be discontinued after the ending of the present contracts.  In addition, under updated EU legislation governing these services, more stringent conditions will apply to future PSO arrangements, having regard for example, to the availability of other transport connections and especially rail services with a travelling time of three hours or less.As the Deputy is aware, the National Recovery Plan identifies savings of €5.5 million in relation to the curtailment of support for regional air services from mid 2011.The Deputy will also be aware of the Value for Money (VFM) Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the regional airports programme which was recently completed.  The review was carried out to assist me in evaluating the appropriate scale of a regional airports programme in future years bearing in mind aviation policy objectives, the updated EU legislation, the improved surface links under the NDP and Transport 21 and the need to address the difficulties with our public finances.The Review is being considered by Government and it is intended that it will be published shortly.It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any likely PSO scheme beyond 2011, including the Kerry PSO service, in advance of the Government decision in the matter.

Provisional statistics indicate that, to date, monitoring in County Kerry has resulted in 267 fixed charge notices being issued.

These services are typically sought in the context of the preparation of legislation, legal advice in respect of policy issues and in the management of litigation including judicial reviews.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and this application will be considered first. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

I can advise the Deputy that on 30 November 2010 the number of sentenced prisoners in custody was 3,721 of which 3,583 were male and 138 were female.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	918	I wish to advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service does not collate statistics in relation to recidivism rates. However the Irish Prison Service facilitated a major study of prisoner re-offending by the UCD Institute of Criminology, published in December 2006.  The study is based on 19,955 prisoner releases that took place between 1 January 2001 and 30 November 2004. This is an enormous sample on any view. The study found that 27.4% of released prisoners were serving a new prison sentence with one year.  This rose to 39.2% after two years, 45.1% after three years, and 49.2% after four years.  The fact that over 50% of prisoners did not re-offend within four years of release, compare well internationally and was considerably less than figures about by commentators over the years.The Irish Prison Service provides a range of rehabilitative programmes which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging and equipping them to lead productive lives on release.Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and in-reach statutory and non-statutory services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on access to educational services and on the provision of work and training activities for prisoners.  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  A significant expansion of vocational training programmes has taken place in recent years and there are now over 90 workshops in place in our prisons capable of catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.The Irish Prison Service is rolling out a fully coordinated Integrated Sentence Management system (ISM) across all prisons and places of detention.  The core goal of ISM is to move to a prisoner centred approach to the management of custodial sentences. ISM is to identify, deliver and measure appropriate interventions to address the identified risks and needs of prisoners.  ISM is currently operating in ten prisons): Arbour Hill, Castlerea, Cork, Dóchas, Midlands, Mountjoy, Portlaoise, St. Patrick's Institution, the Training Unit and Wheatfield.  Currently, 730 prisoners are engaged in ISM.  It is intended to provide ISM to all newly committed prisoners with sentences of one year and upwards.In addition, the Probation Service has an active role in helping prisoners maintain links with family and community agencies and encouraging them to address their offending behaviour while in prison and in supporting them in efforts to avoid re-offending post-release.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	919	PACE is a community based organisation funded by my Department through the Probation Service.  PACE supports people through the transition from prison and an offending background into the community and to break the cycle of offending.PACE residential services provide supported accommodation on a short term basis for 22 homeless males leaving prison. There are 14 high support places and 8 transitional low support places.  PACE also provides low support long term accommodation to a further seven people from offending backgrounds.The specific number of clients PACE residential services worked with over the last three years is: 60, 64, and 58 to September 2010.The PACE training and education programme can accommodate 40 trainees at any one time.  The specific number of clients who engaged with the programme over the last three years is: 102, 87, and 90 to September 2010.In regard to employability placement programmes, Business in the Community Ireland (BITC) is the main provider of support in this area. Since its inception in 2000, the BITC Linkage Programme has been providing a professional guidance and placement service, in partnership with the Probation Service, to persons on probation and to prisoners and ex-prisoners. Currently, the community-based BITC Linkage Programme Training and Employment Officers (TEOs) provide an in-reach clinic service to prisoners in eight of the country's fourteen institutions.Since 2007, a new BITC programme — the GATE Service — has been operating in six institutions — Mountjoy, Dóchas, St Patrick's, the Training Unit,  Midlands and Portlaoise.  Funded by the IPS, four GATE Service TEOs work on a full-time basis in the prisons concerned and provide a training, education and employment placement service.  From the start-up of the service in the summer of 2007 to the end of October 2010, 1,132 referrals have been made to the TEOs and 394 post-release placements have been secured in respect of the 569 prisoners who continued to work with the TEOs following their release from prison.  The specific number of employment placements over the last three years is: 66 in 2008; 83 in 2009; and 66 in 2010 to end October.In recent years, in addition to the direct work of probation officers in regard to accommodation issues, a weekly clinic service has been provided in ten prisons by the Health Service Executive (HSE) Community Welfare Service through the Homeless Person's Unit (HPU). Referrals to this service generally are at the pre-release stage and emergency and other accommodation options, supplementary benefits and fast tracked medical cards are arranged by the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) who provide the information and clinic services. There were 700 prisoners assisted by the CWOs in 2008 and a further 759 in 2009. There is no breakdown available as to the number who were facilitated into accommodation as opposed to receiving other support services. The figures for 2010 are not yet available.Focus Ireland operates a pilot homeless service in Cloverhill Prison which provides a case management and pre-settlement service for remand prisoners.  The service supports participants in accessing appropriate services and accommodation on the pathway to independent living.  The project is supported by the IPS, the Probation Service and the HSE.  By the end of 2008, 68 prisoners had benefitted from the service since its establishment in September 2007.  A further 25 prisoners used the service in 2009.  Figures for 2010 are not yet available.The IPS secured €250,000 in Dormant Accounts funding for the provision of homelessness support services to prisoners in Cork and Limerick prisons.  This service is provided by Focus Ireland and commenced in the summer of 2009.  By the end of 2009, there had been 49 referrals to the service and the two project workers had an active caseload of 39 cases.  Figures for 2010 are not yet available.

The purpose of organising a recruitment campaign earlier this year was to begin the process of establishing a panel of potential applicants who could go on to be recruited as members of An Garda Síochána. This early planning is essential considering that the recruitment and training process — from initial formal application to attestation as a sworn member — could take up to 14 months to complete.Since that announcement was made, the National Recovery Plan 2011- 2014 was developed and published. The plan provides for a reduction in the number of members of An Garda Síochána to 13,000 by the end of 2014. This reduction, and the rate at which it is achieved through retirements, will be taken into account in determining when recruitment will commence.

If they do not have their birth certificate or other supporting document, then they should obtain it, so that the State can have equivalent proofs of the identity of naturalised citizens as all other citizens.  In rare circumstances where an applicant cannot obtain their birth certificate or other supporting documents for reasons genuinely beyond their control, then the applicant will be required to provide an explanation and submit evidence, such as correspondence from the relevant authorities responsible for the issuing of birth certificates in their country, stating why a birth certificate is not obtainable.The Citizenship Division will assess those reasons and if satisfied that they provide a genuine impediment, alternative means of validating the true identity of the person will be put in place.

He was informed that this temporary travel document would not be renewed as it was being issued to him on a discretionary basis.I am advised that provided the Garda National Immigration Bureau is satisfied that he meets the necessary requirements for registration, he would be issued with a Certificate of Registration.  In order to obtain this Certificate or renew an existing registration the person concerned is required under Section 9(2)(a) of the Immigration Act, 2004 to produce a passport issued by an authority recognised by the Irish government which establishes his identity and nationality, unless he can give a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances which prevents him from doing so.It is now a matter for the person concerned to contact his own national authorities in order to obtain his passport.

As part of that investigation, an Angolan passport in possession of the person concerned was retained.This passport was returned to the person concerned on the 15 November 2010.  On that date the said person provided additional information which it is anticipated will facilitate bringing the investigation to establishing the true identity of the person in question to a conclusion.On 3 December 2010, a letter was sent to the named person from the Garda National Immigration Bureau requesting her to present at the Registration Office, GNIB, Burgh Quay for the purpose of obtaining a permission to be in the State.

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

The person presented a passport during this process which, when  examined, was discovered not to contain security features which should properly be contained in such a document.  The passport document was retained by the Immigration Officer so that further enquiries relating to its authenticity could be made.These enquiries will be completed as expeditiously as possible to allow a decision to be made regarding the granting, or otherwise, of a permission to remain in the State to the person referred to.

The Deputy will appreciate that the extraction and compilation of such information would require my officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service to manually examine and cross reference an inordinate amount of files and I could not justify the deflection of such officials from their day to day work to assemble this information.The Deputy should note, however, that my Department is in ongoing liaison with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Irish Prison Service to ensure that, wherever possible, the cases of non-EEA national persons in detention are processed to completion in advance of their release date so that they are deported at the time of their release rather than being permitted to re-join the general population.

The non-payroll budget for the Justice Sector is in the region of €555 million per annum. While it is very difficult to derive a specific figure at a particular point in time due to the number and range of payments I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to pay invoices within a reasonable timescale once the necessary verification checks have been carried out. The vast majority of payments across the sector are in compliance with the Prompt Payment of Interest regulations in that payments are made within 30 days and in many cases in far less a timescale than this. In response to a question from the Deputy on 11th November (Ref 42273/10), I indicated that in respect of the quarter ended 30th September 2010, for the Department of Justice and Law Reform, 85% of payments (€28.3 million in monetary terms) were made within 15 calendar days and 98% of all payments within 30 calendar days. I can confirm that on average these figures are reflective of the trend, currently, throughout the Justice Sector.

For completeness, however, I might mention two issues in the wider Justice sector.Members of the Prisons Officers' Association are currently working to rule in one prison in relation to the procedures used for the filling of posts which carry allowances.  There is no loss in productivity and it is not in contravention of the Croke Park Agreement.  This issue will be dealt with through the normal Industrial Relations mechanisms.Civilian staff of An Garda Síochána are currently engaged in a dispute at the Garda National Immigration Bureau relating to the handling of applications under the Immigration Act 2004.  The matter is currently being dealt with within the Industrial Relations framework of An Garda Síochána.

Provided the complaint fulfils the admissibility criteria set down in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, it will be admitted and sent for investigation.  However, the fact that a complainant has died could, depending on the circumstances of the case, impact upon the progress of the investigation in particular, for example, where the complainant is a crucial witness.  One cannot rule out the possibility that in the absence of the testimony of the complainant, it is no longer practicable to proceed with the investigation.  However each case is dealt with on its own merits by GSOC.As the  Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is independent in the exercise of its functions, the decision to continue with an investigation in a situation such as this is a matter solely for the Commission.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	944	As I stated in response to previous Parliamentary Questions regarding the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan, most recently on 6 July last, promoting religious tolerance is a key objective of Ireland and the EU in relations with Pakistan.  Bilaterally, and through the EU, we have urged the government of Pakistan to make every effort to promote effectively the rights of minorities and to improve their current conditions.  In our bilateral contacts with Pakistan, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining adequate protection for minorities in Pakistan.  Minority and human rights issues were discussed at formal political consultations held between Ireland and Pakistan at Political Director level in Islamabad on 10 February last. My Department follows up with the Pakistan authorities on these matters on a regular basis.I condemn all attacks on the Ahmadiyya community, a particularly vulnerable minority in Pakistan. The attack which took place in Lahore on 28 May was especially heinous. A group of seven Islamic militants attacked two Mosques with machine guns, grenades and suicide bombs, resulting in the deaths of ninety four innocent people with many more left maimed and wounded. A subsequent attack was made on 31 May on the hospital in Lahore where victims and one of the alleged attackers were under treatment. This led to a shoot-out in which at least a further 12 people, mostly police officers and hospital staff, were killed.Ireland is active at European Union level to ensure that human rights, which include the promotion of religious tolerance, are on the agenda for our discussions with Pakistan. Human rights were discussed during the most recent European Union-Pakistan Summit, held in Brussels in June.For its part, the Pakistani Government has given clear commitments to protect religious minorities and to promote religious tolerance. In this regard, the setting up of a Ministry for Human Rights, a Ministry for Minorities and the introduction of an independent national Human Rights Commission are welcome initiatives.Ireland will continue to be active at bilateral, European Union and multilateral level to seek respect for the human rights of all minorities in Pakistan, including the vulnerable Ahmadiyya community.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	945	Ireland has committed to achieving the UN target to provide 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015.  The EU has committed to achieving the target collectively by 2015, and has set an interim target of 0.51% for Ireland and other Member States in 2010.  This year, the Government has allocated a total of €671 million for ODA.  On current projections, this will amount to at least 0.52% of GNP, ensuring that Ireland exceeds the EU interim target.The Government remains committed to the 0.7% target.  However, the reality is that further progress towards its achievement must be influenced by the extremely challenging economic difficulties facing the country.  The National Recovery Plan sets out the budgetary framework for the next four years, in order to restore stability to the public finances. This is an essential prerequisite for the resumption of sustainable economic growth, which in turn can provide the only sound basis for the resumption of sustainable growth in the aid programme.Future allocations for ODA will be based on success in restoring stable public finances, as well as our international commitments.  Later today, the Minister for Finance will present the Budget to the House.  It will include the Government's allocation for overseas development for 2011.  The broad aim will be to consolidate ODA at this year's levels, maintaining spending at 0.52% of GNP.  In the context of our very difficult economic circumstances, I believe this is a significant achievement, and clear evidence of our commitment to the fight against global poverty and hunger.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	947	Since my previous reply to the Deputy, PQ 131 of 23rd September, 2009, the status of the case of the missing Irish girl in Spain has not changed. Our Embassy in Madrid remains in contact with the Guardia Civil in relation to the case and is ready to assist her family in whatever way possible. I am informed that, unfortunately, there are no new definitive leads as to her whereabouts. However, I am assured that the Spanish authorities continue to investigate her case with the hope of finding her, and that her case is still considered by them as a missing person's case.  As well as holding meetings with the members of her extended family, the Taoiseach and I have both written to our counterparts in Spain about her case and both have responded, expressing their sympathy, as well as their assurances that the Spanish authorities were making every possible effort to find her.The Deputy will wish to be aware that the Taoiseach also raised her case with Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero during a visit on 18 May 2010 to Madrid and that the Prime Minister expressed his concern and assured the Taoiseach of the continued commitment of the Spanish authorities to the investigation.More recently, since my previous reply to the Deputy, our Ambassador and the Consular Officer in the Embassy together met again with the senior police officer leading the investigation to discuss the case and, following that meeting, our Consular Officer met again separately with the senior police officers investigating her case.The Head of Consular Division and other officials in my Department have met with the members of her family based in Ireland and with the members of her family based in Spain and continue to raise any issue of concern to them with the Spanish authorities.I can assure the Deputy that the Spanish authorities have continually undertaken to keep our Embassy and her family informed of any developments and, of course, any information received by my Department, either through our Embassy or the Consular Assistance Section, will be passed on immediately to her extended family.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	948	Earlier this year I became aware of allegations that persons accused of carrying out long-term, "deep cover" assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation may have used fraudulent Irish passports.  On being made aware of these allegations I asked the Passport Service and An Garda Síochána to undertake an investigation.  I understand that the Gardaí have since received information alleging that as many as six Irish forged passports using material cloned from the valid passports of Irish citizens may have been involved in the case in question.  I can confirm that the six citizens have been interviewed by the Gardaí and the Passport Service and that those whose passport details were allegedly used have, as a precautionary measure, been issued with replacement passports.   The investigation has not yet concluded.  However, I should stress that what is being investigated is an allegation relating to events outside this jurisdiction.  Accordingly the process of gathering and substantiating evidence is time consuming.On 1 October, senior officials of my Department informed the Russian Ambassador and a senior official from Moscow, who was visiting Dublin on other business, that the Government was investigating US allegations on the use of forged Irish passports by Russian agents and made clear that the Government took serious exception to the forgery and misuse of Irish passports.  My officials notified their Russian counterparts that, depending on the outcome of the current enquiries, we may seek the assistance of the Russian authorities in furthering this investigation.  I will await the outcome of the current enquiries before deciding whether there are grounds for me to meet with the Russian Ambassador and, if so, the nature of that conversation.Once I have received the reports of the investigation, I will consider the evidence before reporting to the Government and recommending any course of action.  I will then report to the House.

In the course of this year we have introduced additional requirements for diplomats wishing to employ domestic servants from abroad including the requirement to provide appropriate medical insurance.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is not informed by the Labour Relations Commission of cases before it involving diplomatic missions in Ireland or their employees as the Department is not a party to these cases and it is not the Commission's practice to provide information to third parties.My Department, has been informed by a non-governmental organisation about alleged cases of exploitation of domestic workers by foreign diplomats, however, the identities of the workers concerned were not made known to this Department.  The Department will assist, as appropriate, in any investigations being undertaken by the relevant Irish authorities into alleged abuses and information received has been passed to the Departments with responsibility in this area. The question of human trafficking is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and An Garda Síochána.My Department wishes to ensure that diplomatic privileges and immunities are not abused and we are working with other Government Departments with a view to implementing additional procedures aimed at strengthening the protections for private domestic workers in diplomatic households. The Department will not hesitate to take appropriate measures to deal with proven cases of abuse by diplomatic missions or their staff in Ireland.

One of these requirements is that a marriage can be solemnised by and only by a registered solemniser.Section 53 of the act makes provision for the establishment and maintenance of a register of solemnisers of marriage by an tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar General).Section 54 of the act provides that the Health Service Executive (HSE) may apply to the Registrar General to have registrars registered in the register of solemnisers for the purpose of solemnising civil marriages. This section also provides that a religious body may apply to the Registrar General to have members registered in this register for the purpose of solemnising religious marriages.The position therefore is that applications are not invited by the Registrar General and it is a matter for the HSE and the various religious bodies to apply to have appropriate persons registered having regard to their anticipated needs for the purpose of solemnising marriages whether civil or religious.

Applications for grants are made by way of completing and submitting an application form annually. In considering previous applications the Department has advised the organisation to secure funding from more appropriate revenue sources in the public and private sectors. While acknowledging that progress has been made by the organisation in developing additional revenue streams through its own activity, the Department remains the primary funder.With regard to continued funding by the Department, applications for funding in 2011 will be considered early next year, giving due consideration to the financial resources available in the context of the upcoming budget. Officials will meet the organisation to discuss this further at that time. In this regard the Department will contact the organisation shortly.

I launched this review on 24 November and it is available for review on the Departments website. This report sets out an agenda for structural change to the DA scheme including the merger of the blind person's pension with the scheme and I would intend that issues such as that raised in the detail of the Deputy's question will be dealt with in the context of progressing that agenda.In the meantime, Social welfare expenditure for 2011, including expenditure on the Disability Allowance scheme, will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs. In an uncertain economic environment, my priority is to ensure that the Government strategy to stabilise the financial position is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	963	The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme is intended as a temporary income support payment and is not designed to be a medium to long term housing support or a permanent solution to a person's housing needs.Current legislation provides for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's request and is subject to the consent of the HSE. Approximately 20% of rent supplement payments are currently paid to a person other than the tenant.Under the current arrangements, even with direct payment, landlords still have to collect the tenant contribution towards their rent (a minimum of €104 per month). The amount of rent supplement payable depends on the tenant's income; in some cases tenants pay only the minimum contribution while for others the tenant makes an additional contribution to their rent based on their financial circumstances. For example, where a person is in part-time income and receives just 10% of his or her rent directly from the State, the landlord would receive the 10% directly whilst still having to collect the 90% from the tenant.The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if this arrangement were to be changed for all cases, for example CWO's would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 96,500 additional clients, the landlords. This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties. In particular, it would also result in CWOs being drawn into disputes between landlords and tenants.Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board's dispute resolution process. It is also open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the HSE any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent. Where a Community Welfare Officer becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement for the purpose for which it was intended the matter is fully investigated.The purpose of the departmental circular issued to Community Welfare Services in August 2010 was to remind HSE staff of the payment options under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, including payments directly to landlords. I agree that making the payment to a person other than the tenant in certain circumstances is appropriate and in the best interests of all parties. However, I do not consider it appropriate to remove the right of the tenant to receive this payment by making it payable only to the landlord and have no plans to amend legislation to provide for this.The current arrangements provide tenants with flexibility in terms of location, the freedom to move to a different location whilst allowing recipients time to seek alternative long-term housing solution provided by their local authority. The tailoring of additional payments, such as rent supplement, to meet the specific needs of individuals and making the payment direct to the tenant is regarded as an effective way of helping individuals realise their potential and take individual responsibility.

The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph. The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.Over the past few years significant progress had been made on the implementation of the project including the selection of a preferred bidder to provide a managed service for card production and related bureau services. Technical specifications were finalised and the necessary organisational change was designed.However, in view of the uncertain economic climate, the project was suspended until formal sanction to proceed was received from the Department of Finance at the end of last year. A contract was agreed with Biometric Card Services (BCS) as the managed service provider from early January. BCS is an Irish registered company based in Bray, Co. Wicklow. The contract is for a complete managed service for the production, maintenance and distribution of the PSC. In summary this entails:Production of the cardPersonalisation of the cardDelivery of the cardProvision of help-desk functionalityAll to be undertaken under strict and secure conditions.For the purposes of this contract, BCS is made up of a consortium of three companies: Morpho, De La Rue Smurfit and Conduit.Formerly known as Sdu Identification, Morpho is based in Haarlem in the Netherlands. It is a world leader in high-end ID solutions such as e-passports, national ID cards and smartcards. They produce passports for several countries (including the polycarbonate insert for Ireland). Their e-passport has been described by Interpol as the ‘most secure passport in the world'. They also produce ID cards (including national ID cards), drivers' licences, banking cards etc. They have all relevant ISO accreditation.De La Rue Smurfit is Ireland's leading security print provider. They have two sites on the island of Ireland (Lisburn and Bray) both of which are ISO accredited. They produce e-passports, excise stamps and cheques and drafts for Irish, UK and African financial institutions. They produced Personalised Payable Order books for the Department for over 20 years and currently supply the PVC blanks for the Social Services Cards.Conduit is one of Europe's leading providers of outsourced contact centre solutions employing over 1,800 people in the UK, Ireland, Switzerland and Austria.Since the project recommenced, significant work has been undertaken including decisions regarding the final design of the card and the development of a secure site in Bray for the personalisation of the cards. It is also necessary to develop a technical infrastructure within the Department to support the management and administration of the cards. Some of this development is being undertaken internally while procurement for the remainder is underway. Deputies will appreciate that, in the context of the procurement exercise currently underway, it would be unwise of me to publicly speculate on the total costs for the development of the technical infrastructure.BCS's costs are for some €24m for a population of 3m with issuance taking about three to five years (i.e. about €8 per card including postage at the volumes stated). It is intended to mitigate the costs of the project through reliance on existing resources and utilisation of relevant data already held by the State e.g. photographs and signatures held by the Department in relation to the All-Ireland Free Travel Scheme as well as by the Passport Office, etc.At the moment it is expected that the card production capability will be ready in December. Following implementation of the necessary registration infrastructure, including staff training, card issue for customers of the Department will commence early in 2011. The overall timeframe for completion of initial deployment of a Public Services Card is dependent on the rate at which it will be possible to securely register all of those to whom it will be issued. Initial registration will be carried out in the Department. Other options that may exist for external registration are being explored.The Public Services Card will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel card, with highly secure cards. Other Departments and agencies will also be in a position to use the card and the infrastructure that will support it.Features such as photographs and signatures and electronic card authentication are expected to minimise the rate of fraud and error arising from incorrectly identified and authenticated individuals.A further benefit of the Public Services Card will be the efficiencies that can be achieved by all agencies and customers using the card. The time spent on establishing identity and authentication will be reduced on both sides, leading to significant potential savings nationally.

Employees are covered by PRSI classes A, E, H and P, which provide cover for the above benefits as well as for short-term contingencies such as jobseekers and illness benefits.PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments.  Self-employed people pay Class S contributions at a rate of 3% per annum, as compared to the 14.75% full Class A contributions paid by employees and their employers, to reflect the narrower range of benefits they receive.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems. There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance. They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year. In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy and the process recognises the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.

This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed workers are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3%. They are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.75% under the full-rate PRSI Class A.Class S contributions provide cover for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's/widower's pension (contributory).  However they do not provide cover for short-term benefits such as jobseeker and illness benefits — these are only available to people covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payment for self-employed people. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.In certain cases, a self-employed person, who had insurable employment in the relevant tax year, currently 2008, and had paid sufficient Class A contributions, may qualify for a jobseeker's benefit payment, provided all the conditions of the scheme are satisfied.Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance. They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.

Self-employed customers do not have to de-register as self-employed persons in order to claim jobseeker's allowance.Legislation provides for the assessment of ‘all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year'. While income from the previous twelve months is used as an indication in estimating likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year. Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for jobseeker's allowance, the person can apply to have his or her means reviewed in the light of these changed circumstances.

Since 2005 my Department has provided over €18m in capital grants to Comhaltas Ceoltoirí Éireann to assist with its regional capital development programme that provide facilities for teaching, rehearsing, recording, performances and session playing.While Comhaltas is primarily about maintaining our older musical traditions it is worth noting that Comhaltas also embraces modern technology to further its aims. The recently launched Comhaltas Digital Archive Website (Cartlann an Chomhaltais) is a unique resource, which allows those who appreciate our native music and song to enjoy authentic performances from the Comhaltas Archive all over the world.My Department has also provided €1m in capital funding to Na Píobairí Uilleann who are doing very important work in relation to the preservation and promotion of the art of piping.The Arts Council provision for traditional Irish music organisations in 2009 was over €2m.  As well as supporting individual traditional artists, through bursary and commission awards, the Arts Council funds directly many organisations, festivals and events throughout the country, including the Irish Traditional Music Archive (the largest repository of traditional recordings, images and ephemera in the world, celebrating the intrinsic value of the music, ensuring the continuity of the tradition and its transmission for future generations), Na Píobairí Uillean, Willie Clancy Week and the Deis Project.The purpose of the Deis scheme is to provide support for traditional arts projects, or projects involving collaboration between the traditional arts and other art forms.  Deis supports once-off or short-term projects.  Projects funded to date have included those with an emphasis on archival material, audience development, transmission, production and performance, professional development, programming and research.

#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	996	Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.This funding increased significantly between 2005 and 2009, rising from €1.5m to €4m.  For 2010 I have allocated a total sum of €5.6m to housing authorities for the purpose of carrying out their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to rented accommodation. This is an increase of €1.6m on the amount allocated for this purpose in 2009 and will bring total funding for this purpose since 2004 to over €20m. Funding for 2010 will be paid using a combined methodology based on the number of inspections carried out by each housing authority and on additional funding being provided for once-off strategically-planned programmes of inspection which may be carried out by housing authorities in addition to their usual inspection activity.The funds in question arise from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees and are held by the PRTB, in an interest earning account, in a fiduciary capacity.  The apportionment of the tenancy registration fee is made by Ministerial Order under the provisions of section 176 of the Act and as such these fees are ring fenced for specific functions of local authorities. In July 2010, I issued a Ministerial Order directing that 80% of the fees received by the PRTB be retained by that organisation with the remaining 20% share to be allocated to the local authorities. Full details of the amounts collected, paid out and held by the PRTB are published each year in their Annual Report and Accounts.Details of the inspections of private rented accommodation carried out, the dwellings inspected which did not meet the statutory standards and prosecutions initiated up to 2009 on a county/city basis are included in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.In general, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activity in recent years with the number of inspections increasing by almost 300% — from 6,815 to 19,801 — in the period 2005 to 2009.  The 2009 data show a year on year increase in the number of inspections carried out of approximately 15%, to 19,801 inspections, and this further significant increase reflects the positive impact of the overall Action Programme on Standards, including increased funding, introduced on foot of a commitment in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, and progress with the implementation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme.However, in earlier years when local authorities' inspections figures were considerably lower, a reserve of unused funds accumulated and, at the end of 2009, the reserve that was held in a fiduciary capacity by the PRTB for the local authorities stood at €9,374,608.  Increased funding allocations in 2010 with a specific focus on targeted intensive inspection programmes, combined with the revised apportionment of the PRTB tenancy registrations fee income, should reduce this reserve considerably by end-2011.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy and inspection arrangements.  In discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement  published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on relevant issues, including targeting inspection activities.In November 2009 I announced the preliminary outcomes of my review of the Residential Tenancies Act which regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private residential rented sector.  These outcomes include recommendations in a number of key areas, with an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act, reducing delays and achieving additional operational efficiencies and consequent savings by the PRTB in the delivery of its functions. While a range of issues still remain to be considered, full details in relation to the background to the review, the associated terms of reference and the preliminary results of the review are available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.Among the main issues that I hope to address in the amending legislation are:A statutory objective of 6 months to be set for the issuing of determination orders arising out of dispute resolution applications.The Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members.The introduction of fixed fines where deposits are illegally retained by landlords.Measures to address non-payment of rent by tenants during a dispute process, in particular to introduce scope for the legal termination of such a tenancy.The separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board.The inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel the current remit of the Board.I do not intend to establish any compensation fund for parties to disputes to the PRTB.  Instead my focus is to ensure that the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants are respected and to further enhance the broader good working of the private rented sector. It is my intention to have the General Scheme of a Bill amending the Residential Tenancies Act before the Government very shortly.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	997	The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has worked to assess the extent of the radon problem in Ireland, and to increase public awareness of the issue. Between 1992 and 1999, the RPII carried out a comprehensive National Radon Survey to measure radon concentrations in Irish homes. The principal objective was to assess the scale of the radon problem and, in particular, identify areas at higher risk of radon contamination above the National Reference Level of 200 becquerels per metre cubed (Bq/m3 ).The Government's approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home.  Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary.If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level, remediation work may be recommended.  Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department, Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options, which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  The RPII has also issued guidance, Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide, which is available on the Institute's website at www.rpii.ie, together with a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations.  In addition, the RPII can be contacted for radon advice on freephone 1800 300 600.There is no scheme of grant assistance exclusively targeting radon remediation works in private dwellings.  However, where a suite of works is being grant-aided under the Scheme of Housing Aid for Older People, which is available to assist older people, generally over 60 years, to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out to their homes, local authorities may also, as part of the package of works, assist with the provision of radon remediation works, where applicable.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	998	I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 to 274, inclusive, together.Recognising that people with disabilities have particular needs, my Department endeavours to ensure that the voting process is as accessible and inclusive as possible.  Currently there are two options available to assist voters with a visual impairment, or who are otherwise so physically incapacitated or are unable to read or write to such an extent that they are unable to vote without assistance — they may avail of companion voting or they may seek the assistance of the Presiding Officer.  Other measures in place to assist such voters include the requirement to have on display at the polling station a large print version of the ballot paper and the inclusion of candidates' photographs and party emblems on the ballot paper.My Department is committed, as set out in our Disability Sectoral Plan 2010-2012, to examining the legislative, logistical and financial implications of independent voting, including voting by blind and visually impaired persons.  In this context, my Department has met with representatives of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and is considering a range of options including the use of tactile ballot templates like those in use in other jurisdictions.  As with any review of electoral practice, it is necessary to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between accessibility and the secrecy and integrity of the ballot, having regard to our electoral system.The Electoral Acts provide for a range of measures to meet the needs of people with physical disabilities, including:The requirement on local authorities, in making polling schemes, to appoint as polling places areas where at least one polling station will be  accessible to wheelchair users.The requirement on Returning Officers, where practicable, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users and to give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day.  In our guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested that consideration should be given to providing suitable ramps in the case of polling stations that cannot be reached without negotiating steps.The requirement on Returning Officers to put in place arrangements to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by wheelchair users. In our guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested the provision at each polling station of an appropriately located table and chair to facilitate this requirement.If an elector anticipates difficulty in gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the Returning Officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.  Furthermore, a person with a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. A person residing in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution who has a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station, can vote at the hospital or nursing home if they apply to be included in the special voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. In order to be entered on the postal or special voters list, a person must apply to the appropriate local authority by 25 November each year. After that date, an application for inclusion on the supplement to the postal or special voters list may be made.One of the commitments in my Department's Disability Sectoral Plan is to provide accessible information to assist persons with disabilities to apply for entry on the register of electors and to assist such persons to vote at elections and referenda.  My Department, in consultation with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, has provided information on the electoral system in Ireland in Braille, audio CD and cassette format  and online in PDF.  This information has been circulated to local authorities who make it available at their public offices and other appropriate locations accessible to members of the public. In further advancing this objective, my Department, in consultation with the National Disability Authority, has issued guidance to Returning Officers on accessible voting.  The guidance provides practical assistance to Returning Officers to enable voters with disabilities (including visual impairments) to vote at their local polling station in so far as is practicable.  The guidance highlights that election staff should be made aware of the needs of voters with disabilities and sets out practical steps that staff can take to provide a safe and supportive environment on polling day.While comprehensive arrangements are in place to assist participation in the electoral process by individuals with physical disabilities, nonetheless my Department continues to seek to improve these arrangements and to have regard to the special needs of such persons.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	999	The State has a legal obligation under the Habitats Directive and under the Wildlife Acts to protect sites that it has designated for conservation purposes. In Ireland a number of sites have been designated for the protection of raised bog habitat within Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) or Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs). These make up just over 4% of bogland in the State where turf-extraction is feasible.Scientific evidence has shown that turf cutting and associated drainage is incompatible with preservation or the restoration of active raised bogs or degraded raised bog. For this reason, in May 2010, the Government confirmed the ending of the derogation which allowed a 10-year continuation of turf-cutting on raised bog SACs and NHAs. Cutting is no longer permitted on the first 31 of these sites, without my express consent. Similar measures will be introduced on a further 24 raised bog SACs from the end of 2011 and on 75 raised bog NHAs in 2013.It is not possible to reconsider the ending of the derogation period. Ireland has a clear legal obligation to protect these sites. To fail to do so would risk infringement proceedings against the State with possible significant financial sanctions.  In May 2010, the Government announced the closure of the Bog Purchase Scheme to new applicants but decided to complete purchases for the existing applications, subject to contract.  An Interim Compensation Scheme was also established to compensate those who have been cutting turf on the above-mentioned 31 raised bogs sites. This interim scheme provided €1,000 to qualifying applicants for this year.The Government also requested my Department and the Office of the Attorney General to undertake further work in regard to how the interests of affected parties can be addressed in the longer term. This work (including examining the issue of alternative bog non-designated bog plots) is ongoing and I intend to revert to Government in relation to these issues shortly.

The Task Force aims to complete its work as soon as possible.In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.  While proposals have not at this stage been invited in respect of the equipment, some expressions of interest have been received, including one from the person whose details were supplied.   Each expression of interest has been acknowledged and is being retained for future reference, as required.

This provision applies to all permissions, including those for one-off houses.

The metering programme is likely to take a number of years to be completed but will be substantially advanced over the next three years.  The types of water meters and associated equipment to be used and the method of installation to be employed will be subject to a competitive tendering exercise.  My Department is analysing the various options to ensure the delivery of the metering programme in the most cost effective manner.

Approvals were largely based on the prioritisation afforded to individual proposals by local authorities.It is intended to issue a call for proposals in the course of 2011 for new projects to be included in the ongoing CAS work programme. In the case of proposals for new housing projects in Sligo town, it will be a matter for Sligo Borough Council to submit a prioritised list of projects for inclusion in the programme having regard to the merit of the proposals received and the extent to which proposals will meet local housing needs.

It is a matter for contracting authorities to administer procurement procedures in accordance with the relevant requirements and guidance; it is not possible to exclude contractors from outside the jurisdiction from participation in a competitive tendering process. Irish companies are entitled to tender for public competitions in other Member States.The Department of Finance has established a suite of contract documentation to be used by public contracting authorities in the procurement of public works contracts. Payments to contractors and subcontractors are governed by the terms set out in these contracts which inter alia require the contractor to certify to the employing authority that all relevant payments have been made. The relevant policy and guidance material is published on-line at  www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie/P1Contracts. These standard forms of contract are used by local authorities engaged in projects under the Department’s capital programmes.Proposed legislation sponsored by Senator Fergal Quinn, the Construction Contracts Bill 2010, is currently before the Seanad. It seeks to provide some remedy for construction sector subcontractors who are unpaid for work done. The Department of Finance has been working closely with Senator Quinn to bring his proposals into an effective scheme without exposing the taxpayer to further costs or risks.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1010	Under the terms of the Local Government Act 2001, it is in the first instance a matter for each local authority to prepare and adopt a balanced annual budget for the coming year.Local authorities are required to adopt budgets which are sufficient to meet the expenditure arising in the year in accordance with the terms of section 10A of the City and County Management Act 1955, as inserted in that Act by section 113 of the Local Government Act 2001.   I will be announcing the 2011 General Purpose Grant allocations, which are my Department's contribution to the costs to local authorities of providing their day-to-day services, in the coming days. These grants are allocated having regard to a range of factors including the overall funding available for the grants, the cost to each local authority of providing its services, the income available to each local authority from local sources and specific grants, and the need to ensure that each local authority receives a baseline allocation that will provide financial stability.The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, recently published by Government, sets out intended initiatives, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.

I explained to them that the report of the Standing Scientific Committee on the Status of Irish Salmon Stocks in 2009 and Precautionary Catch Advice for 2010 advised that stocks of salmon in the River Shannon are significantly below its conservation limit.  As the harvest of salmon by any means is permitted only in those rivers that are meeting their conservation limits and have an identified surplus following appropriate assessment, the Shannon will have to remain closed to both commercial (draft net) and recreational harvesters during the 2011 season.Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), which replaced the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards from 1 July 2010, is currently implementing the Shannon Salmon Restoration Project Management Plan, the purpose of which is to take a fresh look at the issues facing salmon survival in the Shannon and its tributaries upstream of Limerick City.As part of the plan, IFI will carry out an extensive genetics programme in cooperation with UCC and the ESB.  I am advised that there may be an opportunity for former fishermen to be contracted by IFI to assist in aspects of the Shannon restoration project.  The fishermen are aware of this from our meeting.

The introduction of innovative payment mechanisms are under active consideration as part of the overall design of the programme.Among the mechanisms being explored are new financing products including green loans from financial institutions and on-bill financing from energy suppliers.

This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (e.g., suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, or no ‘line of sight' from the premises to the wireless base station).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend, subject to Government approval, to formally announce the launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of the year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas. In the case of County Meath, un-served premises other than those covered by the NBS will be eligible to apply under the new scheme.There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS and that the scheme will be fully rolled out by the end of 2012.Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered by the NBS in County MeathED NameED Reference No.ARDBRACCAN ED167002BECTIVE ED167011CASTLEKEERAN ED167016CLOGHBRACK ED167019CLONMACDUFF ED167020CROSSKEYS ED167022DRUMCONDRA ED167027KILLALLON ED167047KILLARY ED167048KILLEAGH ED167049KILLYON ED167051KILMORE ED167054KNOCKLOUGH ED167056LOUGHAN ED167058MOYLAGH ED167063RATHKENNY ED167075RATHMORE ED167076TROHANNY ED167092

However, RTÉ informed the Department that its plans to launch a Freesat service in the UK in 2009 have been postponed.  RTÉ has indicated that this decision was made as a result of the economic downturn, which has adversely affected RTÉ's commercial service, and is part of a necessary cost saving exercise being undertaken by RTÉ.RTÉ has indicated that this decision may be reviewed if circumstances change significantly in the future.

My Department is continuing to engage with the Authority in relation to the provision of certain further information in accordance with the provisions of Section 37(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009.In relation to publication, the legislation requires that, subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, the Authority shall publish its 3-year estimates or a summary of them on a website maintained by the Authority.  I am very much aware that both public and commercial broadcasters will be keen to view the Authority's expenditure proposals as early as possible and it is my intention to facilitate this as much as practicable.

My Department has drafted a Statutory Instrument relating to the minimum standard of ethanol which can be counted towards the Obligation.  The precise standard proposed for ethanol is TARIC Code CN 2207 1000.  This measure meets the definition of ‘Technical Regulation' under EU trade rules, and as such has to be put through the formal EU process for clearance before it can be signed.Currently, the draft Statutory Instrument is with the Attorney General's office for final drafting.  My Department expects to receive the final text of this regulation shortly and to be in a position to forward it to the European Commission for its clearance before year end with a view to signing the Statutory Instrument as soon as possible.

Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Service providers' decisions to provide broadband services in areas are taken on the basis of commercial viability.  Such decisions are matters for the service providers concerned.In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.The mapping exercise undertaken by my Department at the time of designing the NBS found that a number of broadband suppliers were already active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  In order to comply with EU Commission State Aid rules, any market interventions by Government must be technology neutral and cannot specify a particular form of technology.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend, subject to Government approval, to formally announce the launch of a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of the year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched. ComReg's website  www.callcosts.ie   provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis including County Donegal.

The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Through this devolved model, each CBO is responsible for managing the applications in their own operational areas.  Private contractors are also engaged to supplement CBO coverage and capacity in order to address the increasing demand for the scheme.Through these mechanisms the WHS was delivered to 16,240 homes in 2009 including 808 homes in County Kerry.  To date in 2010 the WHS has been delivered to 22,949 homes including 750 homes in County Kerry.There is no pre-set amount of funding allocated to individual counties under the WHS, as it is a national scheme with a funding envelope which varies on a county by county basis annually.  Activity levels in 2011 will be subject to Budget Day decisions.A dedicated WHS hot line — 1800 250 204 — has been in operation for some time and all queries, from scheme applicants and public representatives, on delivery dates for individual households and/or funding agreements are dealt with immediately.  In addition, the WHS programme manager, Mr. Michael Martin of SEAI is available to deal with queries on 042 939 1548.

The National Postcode Project Board (NPPB) recommended in 2006 that Ireland should implement a postcode system due to the multiple benefits that this would afford to both postal and non-postal applications.The NPPB also recommended that the optimum technical solution to be adopted was the ‘Postal Sector Model'.  This uses an ‘ABC 123' structure to reference in the first instance the relevant Post Town, and secondly the ‘Block Face' (a grouping of approximately 40 to 50 dwellings).In October 2009, the Minister announced his intention to implement a National Postcode System with an anticipated realisation date of December 2011 and that the potential to further enhance the system in order to uniquely identify buildings should be considered as part of this implementation process.

Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  ComReg's website  www.callcosts.ie   provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis, including County Mayo.While my Department does not hold information on broadband penetration by region, ComReg publishes quarterly statistical reports on national developments in the fixed-line, mobile and broadband communications markets.These reports demonstrate the significant progress in broadband roll-out over recent years.  At the end of June 2010 Ireland had in the region of 1.48 million broadband subscriptions and narrowband connections had reduced to less than 5% of all Internet connections.  The year-on-year growth in subscriptions over the preceding 12-month period from June 2009 was over 16.5%.A list of the 112 Electoral Divisions (EDs) covered by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in County Mayo is provided below.  Broadband services are now available throughout the entire NBS area.  My Department and its external consultants actively monitor coverage within the NBS areas.  In summary, broadband services in the NBS EDs in County Mayo are available to 98.66% of premises by means of mobile wireless broadband coverage, with coverage to the balance of 1.34 % of premises being provided by way of satellite.However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1032	Food Harvest 2020 sets out a roadmap for growth in seafood sector and the delivery of the recommendations in that report are, in my view, critical for delivering on the substantial potential of this sector.  In respect of seafood the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 is based on the findings and recommendations of Food Harvest 2020 report which does not rely on increases in Total Allowable Catches and quotas, as the deputy is suggesting, but is based on developing non-traditional species, improving quality and developing value added products from foreign landings for high value EU and niche markets.I believe that seafood innovation and new product development together with maintenance of an international reputation for wholesome, fresh and natural seafood, produced in the most sustainable and environmentally friendly manner, are essential to the advancement and further development of the Irish seafood sector. With this in mind I have sought to support initiatives that endeavour to deliver these fundamental requirements while also seeking to increase Ireland's market share of the international seafood industry.Primary examples of my approach to advance the development of the Irish seafood sector at this time are the adoption of the National Seafood Programme and the endorsement of Bord Iascaigh Mhara's (BIM) 3 Year Strategy. Together these target based initiatives represent a means of ensuring the sustainable development and advancement of the Irish seafood sector. The National Seafood Programme provides Exchequer funded support with the development of new products and processes, innovation, adding value to products, maintaining and improving environmental and food quality standards and improving cost efficiency. In addition, the EU Co-funded Fisheries Operational Programme this year is providing grant aid support for environmental and inshore management systems for the fishing fleet.BIM's Strategy is geared at improving the seafood sector's performance by assisting industry through programmes of skills development, enhanced environmental compliance, product differentiation and labelling, new product development and innovation and improved commercial practices. The Strategy's time frame and targets are designed to contribute to the achievement of 2020 targets in Food Harvest (FH 2020).  Indeed, the level of progress achieved will be a valuable marker of the efficiency of actions being taken under FH 2020.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1038	I am aware that there has been an increase in the incidence of Brucellosis in certain parts of Northern Ireland, particularly Co Armagh, since the beginning of 2010.  The total number of herd breakdowns in Armagh so far this year is 19 compared with 12 in 2009. Latest figures show the county experienced 5 disease breakdowns in June this year, followed by 3 in July, 2 in August but there were no breakdowns in September. However, the number of outbreaks in Northern Ireland as a whole in the period January to September has fallen from 177 in 2008 to 76 in 2009 and again to 56 this year.  Notwithstanding the improvement in the overall situation and in response to the outbreaks in Armagh, the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland (DARD) has introduced additional testing in the Armagh area and they believe that the situation is now under control. The reduction in the incidence of the disease in recent months indicates that this is the case.With regard to the question of whether the disease situation in Northern Ireland could have a negative effect on herd owners in the adjoining counties south of the border, imports of eligible animals from Northern Ireland are both pre-movement tested before leaving NI and post-movement tested for Brucellosis on arrival here. In addition, my Department's DVOs situated in Border areas carry out additional testing measures on herds in these regions as deemed necessary. As Monaghan is geographically most at risk, a comprehensive plan has been put in place involving some additional testing in selected areas and in selected high-risk herds in that county. I should point out also that any additional testing requirements imposed on farmers is funded by my Department. Furthermore, any animals that disclose high readings following a test are removed and farmers compensated under the on Farm Market Valuation scheme.  Given the importance of controlling the risk of spread of the disease to their herds, clearly the on-going cooperation of farmers with recommendations and advice delivered by my Department's veterinary service is important in the context of maintaining Ireland's Official Brucellosis Free status.There are on-going contacts between officials from my Department and their counterparts in DARD in connection with the Brucellosis situation there. My officials will continue to monitor the Brucellosis levels in Northern Ireland and will keep in close contact both at local and central level with their colleagues in Northern Ireland.

The 50% advance payment under the Single Payment Scheme, which issued on 18 October, and the further payment on 1 December were on the basis of those parcels cleared for payment at that stage. Following the completion of the re-digitisation of a number of parcels listed on the application of the person named, over-claims were identified in respect of two land parcels. My Department wrote to the person named regarding this matter, and the reply has been received to state that the applicant is not accepting the amended reference areas. Therefore, the application will be subjected to a further review process, which will be completed as quickly as possible. Immediately this process is completed, the file will be further processed with a view to the payment due issuing shortly thereafter.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1040	I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 322 together.My Department's statutory responsibility extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming. With regard to animal welfare legislation, the Government has approved for drafting the Animal Health and Welfare Bill which gives effect to commitments in the Programmes for Government, including the updating of existing animal health and welfare legislation to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farmed animals, is properly protected and penalties for offenders are increased significantly.  The Bill will include provisions for powers of intervention where an animal is deemed to be at risk as well as addressing such issues as the prevention of unnecessary suffering of animals and abandonment of animals.I am aware from ongoing communications between officials of my Department and representatives of Local Authorities, the Horse Industry and Animal Welfare Organisations that the risk of abandonment of horses is continuing. The evidence indicates that horses are usually abandoned on waste lands/public roads etc and in such circumstances they become a matter for Local Authorities to address under the Control of Horses Act 1996. This Act contains a comprehensive range of measures to deal with problems including the abandonment of horses and it assigns to Local Authorities the primary role for dealing with such matters. The Act contains provisions for seizure and detention of stray horses, the confiscation of horses which stray repeatedly and the disposal of seized horses.I should point out that my Department provides some €2million per annum to Local Authorities to assist them in implementing the Control of Horses Act and officials of my Department are continuing to liaise with Local Authority representatives in an effort to bring greater efficiencies to the implementation of the Act.My officials continue to work closely with stakeholders through the auspices of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) and its Equine Welfare Liaison Group. Earlier this year I published the advice of FAWAC which recommended to owners that, in circumstances where they can no longer provide for their horse, they should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animal before its welfare is compromised, including the option of humane disposal. Such action will help prevent the emergence of long-term and severe animal welfare problems.In terms of future policy on dealing with the problem of abandoned horses, my Department is currently finalising legislation on identification of horses which requires that all horses be micro-chipped and have a valid passport issued from an approved stud-book or horse passport issuing agency. Officials are also consulting with the horse industry on the development of a system to notify and record the transfer of ownership between individuals where the animal is transferred on a permanent basis, which, I believe will provide for greater protection of horses given their relative longevity and potential for multiple transfer of ownership. Officials of my Department have also impressed upon the horse industry itself the importance of its role in the area of horse welfare. I have recently received and am studying the response from the main players in the horse industry to the report published by UCD earlier this year on threats to horse welfare.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1041	The disposal of fallen animals is subject to the Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No 1774 of 2002. Under this Regulation, animals which die on-farm must generally be disposed of through approved intermediate plants (knackeries) and rendering plants.Following the termination of the original Fallen Animals Scheme in April 2009, my Department has continued, within the boundaries of legal requirements, to make every effort to facilitate measures to maximise flexibility and enable reduction in the costs associated with the disposal of fallen animals. This includes allowing cross border trade, permitting direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants and encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal (MBM) for energy purposes. Approval conditions have been drawn up to facilitate the collection of fallen animals direct from farms by approved rendering plants, including arrangements to provide for TSE testing of these animals where required. Discussions are also continuing between the Department and farmer and hunt representatives, to consider the feasibility of extending the network of plants authorised to act as knackeries.Under the current TSE Subsidy Scheme my Department pays towards the cost of collection and rendering of each over 48 month bovine and it is intended that a subsidy for this category of animal will remain in place. There are no plans to extend the subsidy to other categories of bovines or other animals. Keepers pay a maximum contribution of €54.03 to animal collectors for picking up over 48 month bovines from their holdings to facilitate their testing for BSE.Proposals have been made that money be provided to facilitate humane slaughter of  malnourished and unwanted horses. I am not convinced that this is the appropriate approach to what is, undoubtedly, a problem area at present. I am concerned that such an initiative would not necessarily result in the slaughter of the target population i.e. those horses that are most vulnerable. I am also concerned about the reputational damage that might be caused to the Irish bloodstock industry by a State-supported targeted slaughter initiative, given what I consider to be the strong likelihood of an adverse reaction both at home and overseas.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1042	The European Court of Auditors Report on the Sugar Reform package of 2006 was addressed directly to the European Commission. The purpose of this report is to consider whether the reform of the European sugar sector had achieved its main objectives.One of the issues commented on by the Court was the Impact Assessment carried out by the Commission. This was a theoretical exercise undertaken prior to the commencement of the negotiations to assess the possible impact of the reform proposals on sugar production in Member States. It indicated that the Member States most likely to be affected adversely by the reform measures were Ireland along with Portugal, Greece and Italy.The European Court of Auditors criticised the Commission for not using up to date information in the impact assessment in the case of a number of Member States.  The Commission in its response pointed out that "the reform model did not require an analysis of the current profitability and prospects of every individual sugar producer in the EU.
Therefore the Commission did not consider it necessary to collect such data on productivity and efficiency for the model chosen”.As the Commission points out repeatedly in its 17 page response to the Court, under the reform package it was up to operators to decide whether to close processing plants and avail of the compensation package or not.  Obviously industry operators would have the most up to date information available to them in making that decision.Ireland strongly opposed the Commission's reform proposals throughout these negotiations and sought to have them modified in such a way that an efficient sugar industry might have been retained in Ireland.  At all stages during the actual negotiations, the most up to date available information on the sugar industry in Ireland was used and the Commission was fully aware of the fact that sugar processing here was consolidated to one factory.Ultimately, there was insufficient political support in the EU Council of Ministers for the Irish position and our efforts had to be directed at achieving the best possible compensation package. The total compensation package negotiated was worth €353m to Ireland.Greencore plc, the sole Irish sugar processor and holder of the Irish sugar quota, decided to avail of this scheme and accordingly the company renounced the quota and dismantled the last remaining sugar factory at Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme. The decision by Greencore plc, to cease sugar production in Ireland was a commercial decision, having regard to the sugar market situation prevailing at the time and the impending reform and restructuring of the EU sugar sector.As a result of the sugar restructuring scheme the overall EU sugar quota was reduced by almost 6 million tonnes, of which the Irish quota contributed some 200,000 tonnes.There is no mechanism under the present Regulations that would allow for the reinstatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for processing into sugar.  Any proposal to review the EU sugar quota regime would be a matter for the EU Commission in the first instance and any proposal to re-establish a sugar factory in Ireland would, subject to the availability of quota, be a matter for commercial decisions by interested parties. A quantity of sugar beet has always been grown in Ireland for fodder purposes and this continues. It is not affected by the EU sugar regime.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1046	The EU Regulations governing REPS 4 and other area-based schemes provide that payments issue in two instalments. The first instalment of 75% may be paid once all administrative checks on all applications, as well as cross-checks against areas declared on Single Payment Scheme applications, have been completed.  This process is underway and my objective is to make all payments for 2010 as soon as possible. The balancing payment of 25% can issue once all on-the-spot inspections for the year have taken place and these will be completed shortly.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1047	I can confirm that the balancing payments under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme began issuing on 1 December, in line with the very ambitious payments targets I set for my Department in early October. Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme have been ongoing since they commenced on 22 September. I am confident that, by year-end, payments to farmers nationally will have exceeded €1.35 billion under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (DAS).In relation to Kerry the position under the Single Payment Scheme is that there were 7,501 eligible applicants. To date 6,632 applicants have been fully paid and 507 applicants partially paid. Total payments under the Scheme to date are in excess of €51.5 million. As regards the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the position is that 7,081 applicants have been paid over €16.74 million and there are a further 846 applicants awaiting payment, many of whom are currently not eligible for payment as they do not meet the minimum stocking requirement of 0.15 livestock units per hectare.I can confirm that every effort is being made to clear remaining cases for payment at the earliest possible date and, to this end, payment runs continue to be made on alternate days, between the two Schemes.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1048	My Department has no record of having received a 2010 Single Payment Scheme application from the person named. An official from my Department has made direct contact with the person named with a view to resolving this issue.An application was received on 17 May 2010 requesting the transfer of 13.07 Single Payment entitlements to the person named from another farmer by way of lease ending in 2015. The lease/rent of entitlements is only permitted if accompanied by the lease/rent of an equal or greater number of net hectares of eligible land. As a valid Single Payment Scheme application has not been received from the person named, it has not been possible to confirm the leased land parcels and number of hectares that accompany these entitlements. Consequently this application cannot be processed.

Under the Terms and Conditions of the Early Retirement Scheme, lands which are the subject of an Application for First Registration under Section 49, Land Registration Act, 1964, are not eligible for pension purposes unless registration is completed prior to making the application under the Scheme.In the case of the person named, the lands subject to the application were not registered prior to the date of lodgement of the application. In accordance with the Scheme Terms and Conditions, the person named was informed in June 2010 that he was ineligible for payment. This decision was upheld on appeal and the person named was informed of this on 9 November 2010 and of his right of appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office.

In this case the net number of eligible hectares (57.48) is less than the number of entitlements that form part of the requested transfer (74.55). A letter has issued to both parties requesting clarification and further instruction regarding their intentions.A second transfer application was received relating to the transfer of 23.36 entitlements that are presently held by the person named and another person under a lease that expires in 2018.  The parties involved in the present lease need to agree the early termination of this lease and the reversion of the entitlements to their owner before the entitlements can be transferred on to a third party. Letters to this effect have issued to the parties concerned.

In 2011, the Department will be required to achieve savings of €75 million which, as specified in the Plan, includes reduced expenditure of  €37.5m on REPS. This amount represents reduced expenditure on REPS and reflects the fact that the 5 year contract period for those participants remaining in REPS 3 will have ended by the end of 2011. As a result, liabilities under that scheme in 2011 will be substantially reduced. No changes are proposed to payment rates for REPs participants in 2011.

Over 30 Food and Manufacturing companies have completed projects under the different levels of the lean manufacturing initiative.  Following a call for proposals in early summer, 145 Innovation Vouchers were awarded to food companies by Enterprise Ireland. These vouchers offer small companies €5,000 to obtain an innovative solution to a technical or business challenge from a Higher Education Institute in Ireland or Northern Ireland, known as ‘knowledge providers'.A number of projects underway will for timing reasons now mature for payment in 2011.

BIM are responsible for implementation of the scheme.  On 30 July 2010, BIM invited applications under the scheme, with an application deadline of 20 August.  Eligible applications received amounted to €779,647.  Grant offers issued to the companies concerned and BIM is presently assessing claims for drawdown of the grants approved.BIM's administrative costs for this scheme and all other normal functions carried out by BIM are charged to a separate subhead and were not deducted from the €5 million allocated for development of the aquaculture sector in 2010.  However, it was necessary to provide €294,652 from the €5 million allocation to BIM to temporarily fund the operating costs of the Aquaculture Initiative EEIG (CBAIT), pending an examination by BIM of the functions carried out by this project and possible future funding options.  CBAIT was previously funded by the PEACE Programme and its successors, but that funding has expired.My Department is currently reviewing all of its end-year projections.  A decision on the possible use of unspent budgets will be made when this review is complete

The Patents Office conducts examination of applications on absolute and relative grounds, and in doing so the Office must take into account the legislation regarding registrability of Trade Marks as well as how the application would impact on all earlier rights (existing national and Community Trade Marks).When the Patents Office is satisfied that the application is in order it will be accepted for registration and published in the Office's Official fortnightly Journal in accordance with legislative requirements. Following such publication there is a period of three months, again defined by legislation, to allow third parties to raise an opposition to registration. If no oppositions are filed the Applicant is requested to pay the registration fee and on receipt of same the Trade Mark is registered. The total time taken, from application to registration, for cases where no office objections or third party oppositions are made, is typically six months.Cases where objections to registration are taken by the Patents Office or oppositions are filed by third parties can take much longer to resolve.The following table details the average time taken, since 1st January 2007, by the Patents Office to accept Trade Marks for registration.YearNational ApplicationsInternational   Applications (filed under the Madrid Protocol)200714411120081301262009128802010 (to date)9670As can be seen from the above the Patents Office has reduced significantly the time taken in recent years to process Trade Mark applications. Notwithstanding this, the Patents Office continues to streamline its processes and to eliminate administrative inefficiencies by utilising state-of-the-art IT systems and services that have already seen many manual processes replaced by automated procedures.Ireland's governing legislation is in line with international best practice and defines distinct periods of time, totalling fifteen weeks,  which must be allowed for certain actions to take place.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1071	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered on the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.It is my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50's) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.Under Redundancy legislation the onus, in the first instance, is on the employer to pay to the employee their redundancy entitlements.  The employer is then entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, to recover 60% of the amount paid to the employee.In circumstances where the employer is unable to pay the redundancy entitlements, a claim can be lodged with the Department and the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1072	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidationI can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim in respect of the individual concerned on 3 June, 2010.  This claim awaits processing.In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, in general, claims dating from May 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff   working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget   towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility   in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments   by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.Whilst the backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels, improvements are evident.   In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first eleven months of 2010 was 70,247 up over 55 % on the corresponding 11-month period in 2009 (45,201) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009.  The backlog of claims is decreasing — reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a level of 25,950 at the end of November 2010 and is on target on have reduced to a level of 25,000 or less by year end.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1073	Copyright is basically a monopoly balanced by exceptions and limitations.  On the one hand, owners of copyright and related rights are anxious to protect their rights and to obtain a fair return for their efforts; on the other hand, users are concerned to have reasonable access and use of copyright material.  Copyright is central to innovation, both encouraging it and providing rewards.  But this regime may be potentially opposing — if we reward a creator with a monopoly over his work, and prohibit others using that work, then the risk is the prevention of the next round of innovation.  The challenge, therefore, is to strike the delicate balance between reward and innovation.A series of directives has largely harmonised copyright law in the EU.  Whether this regime is adequate in a swiftly evolving digital world and for the promotion of a more vibrant market for on-line distribution of creative content has long been exercising EU authorities.  It is recognised that consumers want access to a wide choice of content and an end to the confusion about how they may use on-line material.  Commercial users need easier and quicker rights clearance structures so they can obtain rights for diverse creative content and rightsholders want to offer their works to the widest audience and ensure that they are remunerated fairly and adequately.To these ends, I strongly support the measures put forward in the recent EU "A Digital Agenda for Europe" and look forward to engaging constructively on the actions proposed:Simplify copyright clearance, management and cross-border licensing by Enhancing the governance, transparency and pan European licensing for (online) rights management by proposing a framework Directive on collective rights management by 2010;Create a legal framework to facilitate the digitisation and dissemination of cultural works in Europe by proposing a Directive on orphan works by 2010, to conduct a dialogue with stakeholders with a view to further measures on out-of print works, complemented by rights information databases;By 2012, review the Directive on Re-Use of Public Sector Information, notably its scope and principles on charging for access and use;After an extensive stakeholder dialogue, report by 2012 on the need for additional measures beyond collective rights management allowing EU citizens, online content services providers and right-holders to benefit from the full potential of the digital internal market, including measures to promote cross-border and pan-European licenses, without excluding or favouring at this stage any possible legal option;In preparation thereof, issue a Green Paper addressing the opportunities and challenges of online distribution of audiovisual works and other creative content by 2010;On the basis of the review of the Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, and following extensive stakeholder dialogue, report by 2012 on the need for additional measures to reinforce the protection against persistent violations of intellectual property rights in the online environment, consistent with the guarantees provided in the Telecoms Framework and fundamental rights on data protection and privacy.In addition, I have been approached about the benefit of introducing various exceptions in EU law and I consider that the feasibility and practicality of these measures should be examined.I am conscious of the importance and urgency of this matter and am fully committed to achieving the fairest balance possible.

While IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of location, the final decision on where to visit and where to locate is taken in all cases by the promoting company.Job creation figures for 2010 will not be available until early 2011, but the Forfás Annual Employment Survey shows that 25 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies in Kerry in 2009 and that at the end of that year there were 14 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing a total of 1,407 permanent staff.

The Enterprise Ireland portfolio of indigenous client companies is, of its nature, not very mobile, and therefore the number of such site visits arranged by the agency only relates to a small number of companies.  Enterprise Ireland has not made any site visits to Co. Kerry this year.Enterprise Ireland monitors the employment trends in the companies it supports through the Annual Employment Survey, conducted in conjunction with Forfás.  The results of this survey are released in January of each year.  The figures for 2009, which are the most recent available, show 130 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Kerry employing 3,151 full time and 444 part-time people.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1081	The Deputy will be aware that the Charities Act 2009 is structured in such a way as to allow for commencement, by Ministerial order, of its individual provisions on different dates over a period of time.  However, commencement of the majority of the Act is contingent on a Charities Regulatory Authority being in place.My Department has developed an implementation plan for the Act, which will ensure that the essential elements are in place to enable the introduction of the statutory regulatory framework provided for in the legislation.  The drafting of regulations in anticipation of the establishment of the new Charities Regulatory Authority is, of course, a key part of that work.My Department is in ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance regarding the resourcing and establishment of the new Authority and I hope that it will be possible to make progress on this aspect of the matter in the coming months.The Act also provides that any organisation that holds charitable tax exemptions from the Revenue Commissioners on the day the Register of Charities is introduced will be automatically deemed to be entered onto the Register, and thus such organisations will not have to apply to the new Authority for registration.  In co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, my officials are working to ensure that the information legally required to be published on the Register of Charities will be in place on establishment day.  As there are well over 7,000 such organisations, the Deputy will appreciate that there is a considerable body of work to be done in this regard alone.Another aspect of the implementation process is delivering on the commitment to consult with the charities sector in relation to the type of financial and activity reporting that they will be required to make to the new Authority.  This consultation is to be carried out parallel to, and will most likely be informed by, a broader review of the UK & Ireland Generally Agreed Accounting Principles (GAAP) that is being undertaken by the Accountancy Standards Board at the moment.  In this context, my Department hosted a successful conference on this issue in January 2010 in Dublin Castle.The Deputy should also note that:Section 99 of the Act, which regulates the sale of pre-signed Mass cards, came into effect from 1st September 2009. It has been the subject of a constitutional challenge, which failed in the High Court, but which, I understand, is to be brought before the Supreme Court; andSections 4 and 90 (SI No 315 of 2010) of the Act came into effect on 26th June 2010.  Section 4 allows for Ministerial orders or regulations under the Act.  Section 90 makes provision to grant powers in any proceedings to the courts to grant relief to charity trustees from personal liability for breach of trust, where the opinion of the court is that, while the trustee may be liable for the breach, he or she acted in good faith and ought to be excused.  In such circumstances, the court may then grant relief in whole or in part under the provisions of section 90 of the Act.In other countries, for example in Scotland, it has taken a number of years after enactment of the legislation for the new regulatory system for charities to be formally introduced and this, I believe, will be the case in Ireland also.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that my Department will continue to advance the process, through its implementation plan for the Act, of ensuring that the essential elements are in place to enable the introduction of the statutory regulatory framework at the earliest possible date.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1083	It is the Government's intention, given the unique nature of the Dormant Accounts Fund, that strong oversight and transparency in relation to disbursements from the Fund will be maintained in the new legislation currently being drafted.  The approach under consideration would seek to afford the Oireachtas a specific oversight role in that context and the detail of such arrangements is under discussion with the Office of the Attorney General at present.Pobal is contracted to administer a number of Dormant Accounts schemes — and indeed other funding programmes — on behalf of various Government Departments, including my own.  In the case of Dormant Accounts, Pobal's role is extensive and involves the following:the advertisement and management of the application process;the assessment of applications under agreed criteria;making appropriate recommendations to Departments/Ministers;agreeing contracts with successful applicants;ongoing monitoring of projects to completion; andmaking payments to projects as they progress in accordance with the terms of their contracts.I understand that some 16 Pobal staff work in the provision of these services for all of the Departments which promote measures financed from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  I am advised that salaries and associated staff costs would account for a significant proportion of the expenditure of €1.5m referred to by the Deputy.As regards the status of Dormant Accounts funding, income from dormant accounts is not regarded as revenue for the Government under the European System of Accounting.  In addition, where allocations are made from the Fund in accordance with the terms of the existing legislation, the Government must account for the fact that such monies could be reclaimed in the future, so it is regarded as an accrued liability.  This liability is recorded in the General Government Debt (GGD) and future disbursements from the Fund will also increase the GGD.

While there will be reduced funding in 2011 for existing schemes and services, there will be an increased emphasis on targeting resources on the area of language planning in the context of the implementation of the Strategy.With regard to investment in the Irish language by other Departments, the Deputy will appreciate that this would be a matter for those Departments to report on individually.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1087	The Dial to Stop Drug Dealing campaign ran in three phases — across 15 Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas — in 2008 and 2009.  The Southern Regional Drugs Task Force (RDTF), which covers County Cork and County Kerry, ran its campaign in March 2009.I relaunched the campaign on 6 October last with a two week national promotional campaign, followed by local campaigns at Drugs Task Force level.  The Southern RDTF again opted to participate and its campaign ran in late October.Calls received have been spread right across the country, including areas that that have not run a campaign. Since the phone line opened in September 2008, a total number of 8,607   calls have been made to date to the phone line with 2,462 reports generated to the Gardaí.   Of these, 38 reports refer to Kerry from March 2009 to August 2010 and since the relaunch of the campaign, 14 reports have been received up to the end of November.I believe very strongly in the notion that communities should be empowered and should feel enabled to make a stand in a way that they need never fear will impact negatively on them.A full evaluation of the current phase of the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing campaign will be carried out on its completion at the end of the year.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1089	Firstly, the Deputy will appreciate that the issue raised by her is a day-to-day operational matter for the bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group.In general terms, however, the Deputy may wish to note the following:Guidelines with regard to the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act have been provided to each of the bodies in question.Each body has advised that it is its policy to pay all suppliers in a timely manner and as quickly as possible.  This reflects not only the legal obligation to pay within 30 days and the additional administrative requirement arising from a Government decision to make payments within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice, but also recognises that it is important for suppliers to receive payments due without unnecessary delays.I am advised that in the year to date the majority of payments have been made by the bodies in question within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice and that the remaining invoices were largely paid within 30 days.  In the case of a limited number of these bodies, I am advised that a very small quantum of payments fell outside of the 30-day timeframe during the year.I have also been advised that any invoices on hand at present and due for payment by bodies to private firms have been received only in recent days and are expected to be paid very shortly.  I understand that in most of these cases, the amounts involved are less than €10,000 but that in one case the amount is of the order of €57,000.

The Attorney General subsequently provided that advice, which indicated that the issue of liability does not arise for snow that is cleared in a safe manner. I arranged for Office of Emergency Planning to brief the Government's Inter-Agency Coordination Committee on Severe Weather on the legal advice received. The Department of Environment Heritage and Local Government and Local Authorities are represented on that Committee.The Health and Safety Authority (which is also represented on the Committee) has issued a statement setting out guiding principles for managers and workers tasked with carrying out emergency/essential services in extreme weather conditions. The Authority has also provided an arrangement whereby the Local Authority's Health & Safety Advisors can receive further advice and guidance, as required.

The legislation provides for the payment of interest on valid invoices that are unpaid after 30 days from their date of receipt. In June 2009, the Government introduced a further non-statutory requirement to reduce the payment period by central Departments to 15 days.    In the quarter ending September 2010 over 94% of valid invoices were paid by the Department of Defence within the 15 day timeframe and over 98% were paid within 30 days. This includes invoices for public bodies under the remit of the Department. At any given time there are recently received invoices on hand which are generally processed within a few days of receipt. The number of invoices on hand at present for public bodies under the remit of the Department is approximately 20, amounting to some €23,000. These invoices will be processed for payment within the next 5 days.
