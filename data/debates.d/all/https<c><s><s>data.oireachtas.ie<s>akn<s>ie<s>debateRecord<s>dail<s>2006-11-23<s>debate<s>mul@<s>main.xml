          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, in light of the fact that the trafficking of persons, mainly for sexual exploitation, is the third largest illegal trade in the EU, there is an immediate need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Ireland to sign the UN protocol on trafficking and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings to ensure that this practice can become illegal and liable to criminal prosecution throughout the European Union.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, the sharp contradiction between the admission at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children by Mr. John Saunders, an author of the Teamwork report, that the withdrawal of any hospital service prior to its replacement by a better alternative was neither common sense nor appropriate and the Health Service Executive's stated aim to use the Teamwork report as an excuse to remove life-saving services from Monaghan General Hospital in advance of having superior services in place and to inflict a similar fate on the north-east region's remaining hospitals before the process is rolled out nationally.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_4">In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the need for Ireland to sign and ratify the 2000 United Nations protocol on trafficking and the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings as trafficking in people is now a global industry and Ireland is a target destination for trafficking gangs.</p>

          <p eId="para_5">I request the adjournment of the Dáil under the terms of Standing Order 31 on the following matter of urgent national and local importance, namely, that 2,500 local authority houses not included in refurbishment schemes are lying vacant and that some local authorities take an unacceptably long time to relet or repair and relet vacant houses, choosing instead to fit steel shutters and allow long periods of vacancy resulting in the impression that there is an abundance of social housing available, ghettoising whole estates and hindering the establishment of a sense of community.  As the taxpayer pays for rent assistance, shutters and extra repairs resulting from long periods of vacancy, it is unacceptable that the reletting of social housing is not dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I have a question for the Ceann Comhairle.  Last Tuesday, I examined the lottery of parliamentary questions.  The Fine Gael and Labour parties tabled 120 questions but only managed to get four or five in the first ten Ordinary Questions.  Miraculously, we had ten out of ten in the last ten questions.  How did that happen?  I put you on notice, a Cheann Comhairle, that I am dissatisfied with the lottery system.  It is flawed.  It is like the electronic voting system, about which the Tánaiste might have something to say in a minute.  I want to officially request that the system be changed so the Ceann Comhairle will first adjudicate on the eligibility of the questions and that the lottery takes place afterwards.  The current system whereby the Ceann Comhairle adjudicates on the eligibility of the questions after the lottery makes a mockery of the lottery system.  I am asking that he does that without——</p>

        <speech by="#CeciliaKeaveney" eId="spk_171">
          <from>Cecilia Keaveney</from>
          <p eId="para_181">I am glad to have a brief opportunity to speak on this Bill, which when enacted will change the name of Comhairle so it may be known in the English language as the "Citizens Information Board" or in Irish as "An Bord um Fhaisnéis do Shaoránaigh".  The Bill is to amend and in particular to confer a function on it to provide or arrange for the provision of a personal advocacy service to certain persons with disabilities, to make certain changes to its membership and provide for related matters.  I heard Deputy Carey suggesting earlier that "An Bord Eolais" should be used for information rather than the more convoluted Irish version of the title for the amended Bill.  I trust the Minister might take this on board on Committee Stage, or perhaps indicate in his closing speech why we need to use more terminology than is necessary.  In the context of a country which is trying to promote the Irish language, with only a minority of people fluent, it is crucial we use terminology that is as simplified as possible, rather than making matters more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I congratulate the rehabilitation organisations, FÁS, the various aspects of the HSE and in particular the voluntary sector, in Donegal and throughout the country, for the massive work that is being done in advocacy and in the provision of support for people with disabilities.  It has not as yet reached the level that is needed, but without doubt it is improving.  I see this regularly in my constituency where I am asked to hand out certificates for various self improvement courses.  Recently the various organisations in Donegal provided free technology facilities for people with disabilities to enable them to participate in anything from ECDL courses to health and safety modules so they can become better qualified in the jobs they are doing.  These are important opportunities for people to expand their abilities and to become as integrated as possible with their societies and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">As a nation we provide a great many services across a whole gambit of fields.  However, in the global age of branding and marketing, we are relatively poor at communicating our message to the people who need it most, regardless of whether it is through grants for third level education, employment opportunities or services for people with disabilities.  I strongly welcome the move by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to change the name of Comhairle to citizens information board and to secure a countrywide branded image associated with citizens information.  Like a small business that grows rapidly, we as a nation need to consolidate before we grow further.  We need to refine, improve, promote and most of all effectively communicate the message we wish people to receive.  In terms of services for people with disabilities, there is no denying we have come a long way.  This is due to a whole range of people, from voluntary and support groups, to charitable organisations, health care professionals through the HSE and of course the individuals themselves and their families.  We see high profile support through the Special Olympics in every county and parish in the country.  This is having an untold positive impact, not only because of awareness raising, but in terms of integration and showing people there are no limits to what they can do if they are supported appropriately.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">In Donegal, we came from such a low baseline not so long ago, that the sector considered there was nothing to be lost.  This has meant that Donegal is now leading the way in many innovative pilot projects and quite often the approach to community support services for people with disabilities there is being discussed as best practice models throughout Europe.  Just look at the Donegal Cheese plant where 75% of the workforce have a disability — but that is not how they promote themselves.  They are just a normal company fighting to sustain and grow their business like everyone else.   However, they need to be regarded as a business by the State and they are suffering, unusually, in terms of regulations on EU standards for employment rights.  They do not want the rights being imposed upon them, but because they are a business they are being told their employees must be entitled to pensions etc.  The Department, in effect, is forcing the company to re-examine what it does and to diversify from what it has been doing for a number of years.  It is an unusual situation in that the fight to give people rights against their will means that what they have been doing for a number of years is being compromised and will possibly be taken away from them.  Their employee rights are being forced upon them when all they want is to continue working with the same degree of flexibility as heretofore, to allow them to meet medical appointments.  These workers are not in it for the money.  Their views are important, too.  In terms of that type of situation the views of people with disabilities need to be ascertained just as much as EU regulations on rights need to be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">While we continue to work towards services for people with disabilities, we need to improve our acceptance and understanding of the conditions in question.  How do we diagnose and measure the extent of a disability?  There is no universal right or wrong in this regard, and I am finding this very much in terms of conditions such as Asperger's syndrome, for example, which not every GP is able to diagnose.  Much of the time children are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.  It therefore becomes more difficult to deal with the condition in the classroom setting.  I came across a case in which an educational psychologist told the parents in question that they should toilet train their child.  The parents asked whether the educational psychologist believed, on the basis of the child's age, that they had not tried to do so.  They could not train the child because it turned out it had a particular syndrome that had not been diagnosed.  People had been regarding the child merely as a child without toilet training rather than one with a certain syndrome.  The issue of diagnosis is therefore very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Many parents struggle throughout their lives to have their sons or daughters diagnosed.  Even with the advances in modern medicine or genetics, this is not always possible.  Not only must a family face uncertainty, it must also battle for services if the child's condition is undiagnosed or does not fall into a neat category among the list of common conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Planning services is difficult in such cases.  Extra resources and greater understanding of the pressures and strains parents face are required.  They should be treated with compassion because quite often they are just entering new territory and are feeling their way in the dark.  This is why the Bill is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Consider the measurement of the severity of disability.  In respect of autism, for example, some professionals are using one tool of measurement rather than another despite there being autism-specific measurement tools.  There should be greater flexibility and more widespread use of the tools required for the individuals in question.  These areas require attention if we are to adopt the person-centred approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">Many patients with communication difficulties do not have the right to non-verbal forms of intervention, such as art therapy, which are being proven internationally.  I recently conducted a study of music therapy and found it quite shocking that in Ireland, which is well advanced technologically and educationally, we do not recognise or define it as a profession.  We therefore expect music therapists, who have spent four years obtaining degrees and who have obtained Masters degrees, to be paid as caretakers in hospitals.  This does not happen in Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the United States, Australia or New Zealand.  If we are to provide access to information, we must also provide access to services.  Thus, we must define music therapy in the health care professionals legislation, which passed through the House last year.  We are losing our music therapists to Northern Ireland and elsewhere because they are paid properly everywhere except in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The multidisciplinary, person-centred approach to planning and delivering services is the most effective.  We talk of it in respect of home care packages for the elderly and sick but it is important that it also be applied in respect of the disabled.  The role of the personal advocacy service should start at birth and continue throughout a person's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">We often talk of the negative aspects of hospitals but there are positive examples of the system working well.  I am aware of a specific case in which a child was born in Letterkenny General Hospital with abnormal features.  These were identified by the consultant paediatrician after running a series of tests.  Through the tests it was discovered that the child has an extremely rare genetic condition, of which there are only three other published cases in the world.  The foresight of the paediatrician was such that the baby was referred to every service conceivable from the outset.  While this meant much travel and many appointments for the parents initially, the services that were not needed were discounted one by one.  From the outset, the parents adopted the multidisciplinary approach to planning services for their child and were given a point of contact from a medical perspective through a paediatric link nurse whom they can call for advice.  They can obtain support from the counsellor for special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The child is now five and is making great progress within the system.  Compare this with the scenario that would obtain if there were no diagnosis at birth.  In such circumstances, parents would battle to enter the system and find out when their child is 12 that they had been entitled to a domiciliary care allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">While multidisciplinary team meetings continue for the child born in Letterkenny General Hospital, more resources are needed to support such teams' work.  More adequately qualified professionals and continuity of service provision are required.  SENOs are not qualified in special needs specifically and this causes great trauma for the parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Where a person is born with a disability or syndrome that will last for life why is that person's eligibility for a medical card continually reviewed?  Why are such individuals brought before boards to ascertain the extent of their disability year in, year out?  This must be addressed.  If one is born with a problem to which science has not found a solution, one should not have to assert one's rights continually.  While providing support and advocacy services in this Bill, we should also remove the hurdles that do not need to exist.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_195">Like every other Member, I welcome the Citizens Information Bill 2006.  I concur entirely with Deputy Keaveney's views on medical cards for people with disabilities they will have for life.  I see no reason for assessing such people continually and forcing them to lodge appeals.  I am sure the Minister will do what he can about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">All Members have been very closely associated with matters relating to disability.  I have said on several occasions over the years, while in and out of Government, that we have never done enough in this regard.  There is always a great shortfall in funding and consequently in the delivery of the services the disabled need.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I recognise the need for advocacy as many people find it almost impossible to gain access to various services.  I am not too sure how certain technical provisions in the Bill will work.  Will each person with a disability be assigned a person who will seek out for him or her the various services he or she requires?  Most people with disabilities, particularly their families, will not ask who will represent them but about the services in place for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">All political representatives in East Galway have been invited to meetings of the Ballinasloe Advocates, a forum that has met many times over the years.  When I was a younger Member in the 1980s, a woman with a mentally handicapped child said at the forum that, irrespective of what way she turned, she did not seem to be able to receive a service.  Every Member has heard such stories and I am not making a party-political point at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Certain changes have been made and there has been a fair bit of investment in the meantime, yet, 20 years after the aforesaid incident, a young mother of not more than 25 or 26 years said at the forum that her heart was broken trying to access services for her two mentally handicapped children.  She was told there are services for everything but when she tried to access them, she could not do so.  She could not get a child psychologist or speech therapist.  The Bill will go some way towards helping this woman.  However, if she could not gain access to the services in spite of her trying to do so on a full-time basis, who could?  If the Ballinasloe advocates and the various groups across Ireland that do so much voluntary work to help those with disabilities cannot access services, I cannot imagine how those at whom this Bill is aimed might do so, despite its helpfulness, unless the service base is improved.  Many of them will be seeking a service that does not exist, and it is incumbent upon us all to put it there.  In dealing with the mentally handicapped and people with disabilities of other kinds, I have met very few who would not agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Like other Members, I have always believed in the human right of the disabled to an assessment and an appropriate service.  Today, in 2006, we are a million miles from that.  I will return to the area I know best.  The Brothers of Charity are active in Ballinasloe, and the Galway County Association for Mentally Handicapped Children is the other service provider.  From my many dealings with them over the years, I believe they provide value for money and that their hearts are in the right place.  They are now as frustrated as everyone else, and I will give Members a case in point.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Brothers of Charity in County Galway currently have 77 cases on their books of persons who require residential care.  Up to a month ago, they had been able to place only 14.  Let us consider what that means for families.  There are over 50 cases in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon where parents are unable to give their child the requisite care, and there is nowhere for that child to go.  There have been harrowing incidents involving very strong children aged 12, 13 or 14 with whom parents can do nothing, perhaps themselves not being in good health.  We have now arrived at the situation where there is generally no place for such children.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Let no one tell me when the budget figures are issued on 6 December that, with our economy, we are unable to handle this area better.  The Minister will have no trouble standing before the House and explaining the increased funding put into the system over the last ten years.  It is true that a great deal has been committed, but the problem is that we are coming from a very low base.  I understand some 400,000 persons are registered as having a disability.  Things are happening even in today's modern age that I cannot understand, and I will explain a few to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Respite care provides an example.  It has been said here many times in recent years that people must give unrelenting labour 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Such total and absolute commitment means their whole lives are tied up in providing a better life for their disabled child.  I know several such parents who would love a Saturday evening or Sunday off once every three or four months, never mind every week or fortnight.  Even twice a year would suffice, but it is impossible.  If their neighbours and relations are unable to assist, there is no respite for them.  That system cannot be right, and there is obviously something wrong at its core, whether it be money, planning or personnel.  If there were a rights-based system tomorrow, the Minister could not provide even a third of the child psychologists or 10% of the speech therapists required.  The task of planning will obviously be much larger than hitherto acknowledged if we are to deliver the programmes and benefits that the disabled require.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Another major problem that I cannot understand is this.  I have never been an educationalist, but I have noticed over the years that many children slip through the net, not having impediments identified on their way through national school in particular.  I know what I am talking about, having dealt with many families in this regard.  There has been major and successful change in this country, but it came from a very low base.  The programme providing learning support and resource teachers is most commendable.  However, like everything else, its effects are being diluted.  Those with the greatest degree of handicap at national school level have access to resource teachers, but the learning support teachers are being saddled with very large classes.  Since so many students just miss the minimum criteria to access resource teaching, we find that many receive much less teaching from relevant experts than hitherto.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">For every young person whose impediments, such as autistic spectrum disorder, were not identified in school, there is devastation.  Imagine that person journeying through the school curriculum and entering the hurly-burly of secondary school.  The Minister will know as a parent that it is a step change.  Most will never reach third level education, but they must try to keep up with the rest of the class and go out into what is a very big, bad world for one with such impediments.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Much can be done for such children if they are identified.  What I have seen done for those assessed in time and given the type of remedial treatment to which they were entitled has been nothing short of a miracle.  However, I cannot understand why we do not have more of that.  Resource and learning support teaching has been useful.  The integration of those with disabilities at local level should be encouraged where possible so the child is with his or her peers, brothers and sisters and neighbours.  We fully appreciate there are occasions when that cannot happen, but on 6 December I expect and hope for a substantial increase in funding for the handicapped.  We need not reinvent the wheel, since we now know what works.  There is no need to cover old ground because we know what is needed.  I hope that before long, hopefully in the next year, a situation can never again arise where a mother of two children with disabilities declares at a public meeting that she has nowhere to go and that her passage is blocked at every avenue.  This woman simply could not access the services she was assured were in place.  We are all assured that those services are in place, but it is difficult to find them when they are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">How many persons will be employed by the new citizens information board?  Will they be dispersed throughout the State or will they all be based in Dublin?  What type of recruitment does the Minister propose?  I am sure it will be open and transparent, but what educational qualifications will be required and what training will be given to successful applicants?</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I pay tribute to the Department of Social and Family Affairs as the most efficient Department in terms of providing information.  I am sure other Members will agree that the communication system within the Department is open and helpful.  It is the least one would expect but it cannot be said for some Departments.  When I telephone on behalf of constituents in regard to some inquiry for which they cannot get the answer to which they are entitled, I sometimes wonder about the service motto or mission statement of some Departments.  That is not the case with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">In the former Western Health Board area, persons who apply to the Health Service Executive for housing aid for the elderly, which is a great scheme that has worked well for many years, are faced with long waits for a response.  It seems a decision was made to postpone approvals under the scheme in the past two years.  These are people of 75 or 80 years of age who require certain small but essential improvements to their homes that would make them more comfortable and allow them to remain living there.  Many such persons applied to the scheme two years ago and received no response until last month.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Minister, as a person with broad experience, must agree it is not acceptable, under any circumstances, to treat elderly persons in this way.  To ask a person of 80 years to wait two years is like asking a person in his or her 40s to wait ten years.  Irrespective of the resources available to the Government in this Celtic tiger economy, does the Minister agree that nobody could stand over such inadequate services for persons with disabilities?  I hope all of those who have applied for the housing aid for the elderly scheme will be successful soon.  It is a case of only €3,000 to €5,000 per approval, but it makes the world of difference to the recipients by making their homes easier and more comfortable to live in.  This helps to address a plethora of other problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Deputy Andrews made a good point during the previous day's debate when he spoke about getting people with disabilities into open employment.  There were great efforts in this regard 15 or 20 years ago and some degree of success.  It seems, however, that this effort has begun to slip dramatically.  It is something that should be revisited because there are many people who are well qualified and have sufficient confidence to work in certain jobs if they were only given the chance.  It seems most of them are not being given that chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I hope this Bill will bring some relief to those with disabilities.  It is undoubtedly a step in the right direction.  If anybody believes, however, that it will be the cure for all evils and that it will fill the gaps that currently exist in the system, they are living in cloud cuckoo land.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_173">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_213">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I concur with Deputy Connaughton's comments on the facility provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The services are accessible and the staff customer-friendly, or Deputy-friendly at least.  I am particularly interested in this Bill because I have worked with people with disabilities for some time, in my previous career as a teacher and for the past 23 years as a politician.  I am aware, in particular, that such persons are not always aware of their entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I have done some research into the origins of the concept of citizen advocacy.  One could say it has been around for generations and centuries.  Officially, however, it originated in the United States in the 1960s when Professor Wolf Wolfensberger put forward the concept in order to provide a continuity of protection and advocacy for children with cerebral palsy should anything happen to their parents or guardians.  In an article written in 1995, Professor Wolfensberger reviewed a set of 22 assumptions that point to citizen advocacy as a valid model strategy.  He observed that the need for advocacy and assistance is widespread among people who suffer disadvantage and that the type of advocacy and assistance varies widely.  He noted that in some cases, help must come from people with the competencies and resources that the person concerned lacks.  All people, he contended, including disabled people, have some important needs that can only be addressed within a freely given voluntary relationship and that the needs of many people with significant difficulties are better met on a long-term basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The model of citizen advocacy has since spread to other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Ireland.  It is part of the system in many jurisdictions.  As the Minister stated, advocacy is a traditional concept linked to the notion of the citizen taking responsibility for himself or herself and for his or her neighbour.  Traditionally in rural communities the advocate was usually the local teacher who filled out forms and made essential contacts for people, for which they were highly regarded.  Otherwise, the role was filled by an individual in the community adept at writing letters such as the local garda, councillor, Deputy or parish priest.  The Bill formalises this tradition.  On a daily basis advocacy is still carried out by many, such as parents and teachers.  Despite all the services and advisory agencies for people with disabilities, I am amazed people do not know exactly to what they are entitled.  I hope the Bill will help to remedy this.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I have some concerns about the Bill.  As Deputy Connaughton asked, will the required number of advocates be available for the large number of people who will seek this service?  People wishing to avail of the service must apply for it.  In some instances of disadvantage, some people would require the assistance of an advocate to apply for the service.  Who will apply for these people?  It is important to communicate to people that they can apply for the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">A decision-making process will be in place as to who is entitled to the advocacy service.  As a large number of applications will have to be prioritised, will the Minister clarify on what basis this will happen?  In some cases it can be difficult for a layperson to determine levels of disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The Bill will provide extra functions to Comhairle.  Will resources be increased to ensure these functions will be effectively implemented?  The Minister referred to standards and that the services will be underpinned with strong values and principles.  Will the Minister clarify the guidelines that will be in place for advocates and will they be screened?  An advocate could have a working relationship with an individual for a long period.  An advocate could be assigned to a person when he or she is very young.  Their working relationship could develop over a long period.  It is, therefore, important that advocates are well-trained and professional.  What provision has been made for the training of potential advocates?  Does the Bill contain provisions for in-service training?</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I welcome the statutory recognition of citizen information centres.  The two I know of in Tralee and Listowel operate effectively at the coalface.  At times, people prefer to attend a citizen information centre than attending a Deputy's clinic because they will not feel beholden and it is a public service.  Will the Minister ensure the centres are properly resourced and their office environs are welcoming and comfortable?  Some centres have not been provided with good accommodation, which is not acceptable for either staff or users.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Despite the services made available to the new Irish — refugees and asylum seekers — they need continued support.  While the numbers of refugees entering Ireland has decreased, many have started families and need assistance.  Many will seek it from the advocacy service.  Has provision been made for this group?</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Some people with disabilities or the elderly are unaware of housing grants available to them.  A system should be in place where, in some cases of disadvantage, if a person inquires about a grant, a local authority would fill in the form for the applicant.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The new service will come up against the area of psychological assessments for young people.  For example, it is accepted that early assessment and intervention is the best way in dealing with most disabilities.  Will the Minister clarify where an advocate can go if the service required is not available?</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The benefits of citizen advocacy particularly for those with learning difficulties are unambiguous.  The long-term nature of citizen advocacy partnerships offers the potential for developing self-confidence and new opportunities for those who may have experienced exclusion for many years.  Citizen advocacy schemes, however, present several organisational difficulties.  One is the recruitment of enough suitable long-term advocates.  Many schemes share this problem, as the pilot scheme in Galway demonstrated.  An interruption in this long-term relationship may have a traumatic impact on the user's well-being if it is not handled properly.  The relationship between the advocate and the user should be monitored because the advocate may not be suited to the client's needs.  Does the Bill provide for monitoring and evaluation of this scheme?  It takes a degree of skill to make a good match between the advocate and the user.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Other difficulties surrounding citizen advocacy include the need for a co-ordinator with sufficient time and resources to manage the scheme, the conflict between the relative benefits of an untrained citizen advocate and a more expert casework advocate and the tendency for some advocates to befriend rather than assume an advocacy role.  The advocate should be professional and avoid getting too close to the user who could be traumatised by the death or departure of the advocate.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Some health professionals are not inclined to accept the opinion of a lay advocate who, for example, refers a client for a psychological assessment.  Has the Minister considered how binding is the advocate's recommendation for a service where available and the relationship between advocates and other professionals?</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I welcome this Bill which legislates for what in some cases already exists but for which there will be more need as community relationships continue to break down.  This trend began in urban areas and is moving to rural areas.  This service will play an important role for people who cannot look after themselves.  I compliment the Minister on bringing the Bill forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_227">One cannot but welcome the Citizens Information Bill which in theory sets out to ensure that people with disabilities are supported, to enable them as far as possible to lead independent lives, reach their potential as individuals and participate fully in society.  In practice, however, people with disabilities continually experience difficulties in their daily lives.  Irrespective of the grand notions contained in this Bill practical difficulties remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The Minister said that the intention is to have an effective combination of legislation, policies, institutions and services in place to ensure equal access to services and full participation in everyday life for people with disabilities.  We all share that wish but merely including such aspirations in legislation does not make them happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">This Bill provides for the introduction of a personal advocacy service for certain people with disabilities who would otherwise have difficulty obtaining access to services.  That is all very fine but those who are able to access services and to represent themselves fully should be given what they seek first.  There is no benefit to people with disabilities in putting everything on paper but being deficient in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">One of the most basic human rights is the right to vote.  In theory, people have that right but in practice wheelchair users have difficulty gaining admission to polling booths.  I raised this issue with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and, to make it easy for him, specified one polling station in my constituency, East Galway.  In order not to overburden the Minister I kept the question short.  I asked him if measures were being put in place to make a polling booth in County Galway wheelchair accessible.  I expected a direct answer along the lines that the Minister was concerned that a person in County Galway could not gain access to a polling booth to cast his or her vote.  I further expected him to advise me that he had initiated steps to ensure that this situation would not occur again.  It should have been nice and simple.  I was the parliamentary advocate on behalf of this person.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">In the interests of accuracy I will read the Minister's reply:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_232">Under the Electoral Act 1992, the selection of buildings to be used as polling stations at an election or referendum is a matter for the returning officer.  [The Minister is kicking to touch here.]  The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996 provides that local authorities, in making polling schemes, shall endeavour to appoint polling places which allow the returning officer to provide at each place at least one polling station that is accessible to wheelchair users.  The Act also requires that the returning officer shall, where practicable, provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users.  In addition, the returning officer must, where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_233">If an elector will have difficulty gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the returning officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.  If a person has a physical disability or physical illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station, the person can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">What does that mean?  It is such waffle.  There is no reference in the Minister's reply to the specific polling station.  Neither is there any expression of regret that a person was denied his or her right to vote, nor to the rights of people with disabilities.  The Minister made no statement to the effect that everybody is equal under the Constitution or that everybody should be treated equally and with respect.  Neither did he acknowledge that public buildings should be accessible to all.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The nub of the Minister's reply is: "If an elector will have difficulty gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the returning officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station".  In practice, that requires a person who uses a wheelchair to go to a polling station a number of days before polling day to check it out for accessibility.  If he or she cannot gain access, it is necessary for him or her to search for an accessible polling station in the constituency and write to the returning officer seeking permission to vote at the other venue.  That is such rubbish and it is such an insult to wheelchair users.  Citizens are not being facilitated to cast their votes in their local polling stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Another issue of great concern to people with disabilities in rural areas is their inability to access public transport.  I refer in particular to bus services.  This is a classic case of discrimination against people with disabilities.  We do not need further legislation to know that it is wrong that some members of society cannot access public transport.  A decision is required from Government to make this unacceptable.  A further decision is required to rectify the matter and ensure that all public transport vehicles are made fully accessible so they can be utilised by all citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Train services are also inadequate and are not designed to facilitate people with disabilities.  For example, a wheelchair user who boards a train in Galway to travel to Dublin has no opportunity to access toilet facilities.  That is a deplorable situation.  While I welcome the Citizens Information Bill, it will not solve such problems as I have outlined that confront people with disabilities on a daily basis.  The problems I have outlined are not new to the Minister but I urge him to ensure they are taken on board and rectified by the Government so that all citizens are treated equally and with respect and dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction, however, the introduction of legislation alone will do little for people with disabilities.  What is required is determination on the part of the Government to ensure that the difficulties faced by people with disabilities are eliminated.  Practical measures must be introduced as a matter of urgency to underpin the legislation on the Statute Book that is designed to assist people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Deputy Keaveney raised an important issue in her contribution, namely, people with lifelong illness.  I hope the Minister will at least deal with this matter because it will not involve any expenditure by the Exchequer nor require any detailed analysis to be carried out by a Department.  In effect, it would not impose any burden on Departments.  People with lifelong illnesses are entitled to have a medical card but they should not have to apply for it on an annual basis.  A list is available of the qualifying illnesses for the provision of a medical card and there is no reason a person should have to reapply for this card annually when his or her situation is not likely to change.  Why are people put through the misery of annual applications?  I urge the Minister to take on board this point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_240">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I thank the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, for being present for the debate.  It is important that the responsible Minister be present to hear the contributions we make.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I also compliment the staff in his Department who provide an excellent service, both in regard to access to information and the provision of information in a speedy and comprehensive manner to Members of the Oireachtas and the public.  If the Minister could instil one thing in his Government colleagues it should be for them to follow the benchmark of the officials in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  If that were the case, a great deal less time would be spent dealing with personal issues on the floor of the House or in written parliamentary questions.  All the officials in the Department deserve credit in terms of their accessibility and responsiveness to queries raised by Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">In addition, I specifically compliment the information officers in the Department offices around the country who do a tremendous job.  They provide information in an unbiased manner.  In many Departments, people have difficulty gaining access to unbiased information from agents of the State.  People are afraid that if they bring something to the attention of a Department they could end up either being prosecuted or penalised for it.  Not only do information officers provide useful information in a user-friendly manner but they also make themselves available to address public meetings in their catchment areas.  All credit is due to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Citizens information centres do a tremendous job in making information available to the public.  On Monday I heard Derek Mooney's radio programme on Radio 1.  A representative of the citizens information network has a regular slot on that programme.  The type and clarity of the information provided is most useful.  A similar service is provided by citizens information officers throughout the country on local radio stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">There are two aspects to the Bill, the first of which is to facilitate the implementation of the Government's legislative programme in terms of improving services for people with disabilities. It will also enhance the functions of Comhairle and rename it the Citizens Information Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The first issue I want to raise does not relate directly to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It relates to Comhairle, the Citizens Information Board and, sadly, the Health Service Executive.  It came to my attention last August that the standard letter the Health Service Executive now issues to applicants for medical cards and those who have had their medical card entitlement reviewed does not give any explanation as to the reasons for a decision.  A person who is granted a GP-only card is not told that he or she can appeal the decision and is not given a breakdown of how means are calculated, as was standard procedure under the former health boards.  For some unknown reason the Health Service Executive does not want to release that information to the public.  That is wrong on two counts.  First, people have a basic right to be told why they are deemed ineligible for a medical card or a GP-only card.  This was common practice until the Health Service Executive took over.  Second, people should be informed of their right to appeal a decision.  That is not happening.  They are aware they can appeal the granting of a GP-only card instead of a medical card, but they are not informed to whom the appeal should be submitted nor are they informed that they can appeal a decision to refuse them a medical card.  A bunch of gurus within the Health Service Executive replaced the medical card application forms with a new combined medical card application form and, based on the responses sent to people around the country, it drafted a new standard letter which takes no account of people's basic right to information.  It is clear that the Health Service Executive is in an ivory tower and does not consult with individuals on the ground who are at the front line of the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I raised this issue with the local Health Service Executive officers last August.  A couple of the officials within the Health Service Executive contacted me directly and complimented me on highlighting this issue, but it took until 21 November to get a response, and that response was to the effect that my suggestions had been forwarded to the IT unit for its attention.  That is wholly unacceptable and a gross infringement of the right of the public to information.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I will turn to the Minister in a minute but while I am on the issue of medical cards and the gurus who examined the application forms, the standard application form does not include a section for a statement of income, which was previously standard procedure.  It is standard procedure in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and certainly in the health boards in the west.  Whether we agree with the method of calculation is not the point.  There was such a section in the application form which has now been removed.  The form is four or five pages longer than it used to be but when someone makes an application they invariably receive a response to the effect that they have not provided all the information required.  That is wholly unacceptable.  It delays the issuing of medical cards to people who are entitled to them and this delay denies people their basic rights.  It is time the Health Service Executive got its act together in this regard.  If it does not have the competency within its organisation, there are plenty of Members on both sides of this House who would be quite willing to advise as to the basic information that should be required in these forms and the response that should be given to individuals.  If the Health Service Executive is not prepared to talk to Members, I am sure the Minister would make his officials available to address these basic problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I also want to raise the issue of the right to information in the context of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The purpose of the family income supplement is to give a top-up payment to low income families.  It is a very useful payment for those who are aware of it.  It takes them above the poverty line and makes staying in employment a viable option for many people.  However, many people are unaware of the availability of family income supplement.  I am aware the Department has done studies on this in the past and runs advertising campaigns at regular intervals to provide information to the public.  We are falling short in this area and a special effort needs to be made to try to increase the uptake of family income supplement.  Given the large non-national population working here, that information needs to be made available not only in the English and Irish languages but also in other European languages.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The farm assist scheme is another scheme that has not had the type of uptake that would be expected, as shown by the Department's research.  Part of the problem is the difficulty in assessing farmers' eligibility.  I am aware it will be difficult, but I ask the Minister to re-examine the issue with a view to resolving that problem.  It has also been brought to my attention that farmers who are liable to tax believe they should have the option of making their tax returns to the Revenue Commissioners available to the Department of Social and Family Affairs as proof of their income.  It would not suit farmers who are not liable to tax and I would not want to put them to the expense of producing accounts.  However, where accounts are produced, it should be possible to provide these to the social welfare inspector as proof of income rather than requiring people to go through the whole rigmarole of providing receipts and documentation again.  It would speed up the processing of a number of schemes.  I ask the Minister to examine that possibility.  When I raised the issue in the House on 1 November the Minister responded that the tax assessments show the factual income position as required under the social welfare legislation and could be used by a social welfare inspector in preparing a report but that this would not be a reliable approach in all cases.  I accept that, but in many cases it would suffice and it would reduce delays in processing some applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Over the years the Department has examined in detail issues relating to carers.  We need to provide access to basic health and safety information to home carers in particular.  They should, for example, have to right to go on a manual lifting course, even if they are not entitled to a carer's allowance.  They should be allowed to attend a short course to learn the basic steps a home carer must deal with on a daily basis, including working with elderly or disabled people and other health and safety issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I also ask the Minister to review the carer's allowance application form, which has come in for criticism owing to the volume of paperwork that needs to be completed.  We do not want to turn people off when they see the application form.  People can be discouraged from applying for schemes when they see the size of the application form.  In many cases, when one goes through the form, it is not too difficult for most people.  We need to consider streamlining the forms and making them more accessible and I know the Department has done considerable work in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">It would be great if it were no longer necessary for people to submit birth and marriage certificates.  I welcome that it is no longer necessary to submit children's birth certificates to receive child benefit.  I am the beneficiary of that change, which is a positive development.  I do not know why the rest of the population, including older people, are required to get these certificates and submit them given that they are now available electronically.  Where there may be a difficulty in certain circumstances, let the Department revert to the applicant advising that it cannot locate the electronic record and asking him or her to supply the physical certificate.  In many cases, there is no such need.  The technology exists and the Department is using it very successfully for the payment of child benefit for newborn babies.  Surely it can be rolled out for the rest of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">On the subject of electronic communication, I ask the Minister to work with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the issue of the farmers' early retirement scheme.  On reaching the age of 66, farmers in receipt of early retirement payments are supposed to have the value of the old age pension deducted from their early retirement payment.  While we can argue about it, that is the law as it stands.  Owing to a lack of communication between the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Agriculture and Food, farmers often get a letter from the Department of Agriculture and Food 12 or 18 months later seeking recoupment of the value of the old age pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Today, it is the farmers' responsibility upon receipt of their social welfare pension to advise the Department.  Surely the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is aware that the farmer is in receipt of the early retirement payment because it is mentioned on the application form, could advise the Department of Agriculture and Food that the person is now in receipt of an old age pension and that its value should be deducted from the farm retirement payment.  This would avoid people getting demands for large amounts of money from the Department of Agriculture and Food purely because of the existing lack of communication.  It would not take much to do this and would simplify the system and reduce hardship for many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I wish to raise an old chestnut with the Minister, which is the leasing of land for farmers.  While I know the Minister and his officials are sick to death of me raising this issue, I will continue to raise it until we get some movement on it.  At present, someone in receipt of a non-contributory State pension who is in employment has the first €100 of income exempted from the means test, which is commendable.  However, in the case of a farmer who was in the early retirement scheme and it finishes or is not in the early retirement scheme and is leasing out land, the full value of the lease minus €20 per week is taken off the income.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">In many cases it does not make financial sense for farmers to lease out their land.  It makes more sense for them to keep two cattle on that land so that an income assessment can be done.  It causes delays and ties up social welfare inspectors' time carrying out unnecessary assessments.  The amount of income coming in is extremely small and it also prevents the release of farmland to young progressive farmers, who might stay in a rural area and reduce the isolation of such farmers.  It would also reduce the amount of land going to rack and ruin belonging mainly to farmers without any successor.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">It is difficult enough for farmers who are leasing their land and are not involved in the farm retirement scheme because at any stage they can choose to revert to farming again by putting two cows on the land, leading to the need to carry out a farm income assessment.  However, once farmers leave the early retirement scheme, they have no other option but to lease the land or transfer it to a successor because they cannot go back farming, as it is one of the conditions of the early retirement scheme.  It causes extreme hardship for them because while they are in the farm retirement scheme, the first €5,000 of the value of the lease is exempt from income assessment regarding the State non-contributory pension.  However, once they leave the early retirement scheme, the full value of the lease less €20 per week comes into the means calculation.  The Minister should consider this anomaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Introducing the same exemption for long-term leases as already exists in the Department of Social and Family Affairs for participants in the Department of Agriculture and Food's early retirement scheme would address the anomaly in most cases.  This problem is only arising now because, from the end of this year, farmers will be leaving the early retirement scheme and it will become a bigger issue in coming years.  I have raised this matter on numerous occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Farmers became liable to pay PRSI in the late 1980s.  Any farmers without five years' contributions paid at the time they reach 66 are not entitled to any State contributory pension.  Surely this could be given to them on a <i>pro rata</i> basis based on the two or three years they paid PRSI.  While it only affects a small number of cases, it is causing hardship and is an anomaly that the Minister should review.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I thank all those who contributed to a long debate on the Citizens Information Bill.  I was able to listen to every speaker who contributed.  I took careful notes of the points made by Deputies on all sides of the House.  I thank them for giving the Bill such detailed and serious consideration and I look forward to teasing out some of the outstanding issues on Committee and Remaining Stages and during its passage through the Seanad.  I hope we can complete the legislation before the recess in order that the advocacy service can be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Bill is designed to meet the needs of people with disabilities in a changing 21st century Ireland.  It seeks to bring the provision of information on State services into the modern era by rebranding, redesigning, refocusing and modernising.  The Bill proposes the provision of personal advocates for people with disabilities.  I am glad Members on all sides of the House indicated their support for those objectives.  We can deal with any points that have been raised in respect of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I wish first to deal with the change of name.  We gave this matter long and careful consideration.  It is with great reluctance that I would drop an Irish phrase or dilute our commitment to the Irish language in any way.  It would ill behove someone such as me who comes from the west to try to do something of that nature.  However, there was a larger issue at stake.  In trying to place a new focus on the provision of information, and remembering that Comhairle is charged with providing information relating not only to my Department but also to all State social services, I took the view the time had come to try to put in place a coherent brand with which we could move forward and which would be easily identifiable by members of the public in the context of the provision of State-funded information services.  I also wanted to put in place a strategy to strengthen the public profile of the information services provided by citizens information centres throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">In considering this matter, I formed the opinion that having an organisation called Comhairle with a website called Oasis which funds citizens information centres is too much for people to take on board.  The very first duty of any information provider is to ensure that it and its services are easy to locate.  This new structure will make matters easier for people.  If the House approves the legislation, the title "Citizens Information Board" will apply nationally as well as locally.  All of the very fine citizens information centres throughout the country use that title and there is great support for it and the national body funds them on behalf of the taxpayer.  However, it does not own or operate the centres.  In that context, I felt it important to try to engage in a clean and crisp rebranding that provided evidence of our joined-up approach to this matter.  That is why we will have a citizens information website rather than Oasis.  We will also part company with the title "Comhairle" and move on to a national body that will be termed "the Citizens Information Board".</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The change of name will focus the board on the nature of its work.  Comhairle has done a fine job but I would like to refocus it on what it must now do, namely, to ensure a citizen or anyone else who wants information can obtain it.  In addition, there will be a certain clarity with regard to the national organisation and its local counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">A number of Deputies queried the use of the word "citizen".  I see their point.  When I came to address this issue, I was concerned as to whether non-citizens would feel that we were somehow failing to take account of their needs.  I consulted some of the immigration bodies and organisations and discovered they did not have an issue with it because people tend to see themselves as citizens of Europe and aspiring citizens of Ireland.  Immigrants are not of the opinion that because, in technical terms, they are not Irish citizens, the title does not refer to them.  It would not make sense to try to change the names of the various citizens information centres.  The logical step was, therefore, to proceed in the manner outlined in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The additional costs relating to rebranding will be imposed over a period and will not be hugely significant.  All the documentation — booklets, forms etc. — must be continually updated in any event.  This will not be a major commercial rebranding and I am not overly concerned about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The change of name is being done to help the customer.  I was of the view that trying to move forward using the titles "Comhairle", "Oasis" and "citizens information centres" would be too confusing.  We will now have the citizens information board, the citizens information centres and the citizens information website.  The new brand will mean everyone will automatically be aware that if they require any information regarding State social services, they can immediately consult the new citizens information structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Deputies Carey and Sargent queried the translation of the word "information" into Irish.  Officials of my Department made further inquiries of the Oireachtas translation service and were informed the translators reserve the word "faisnéis", as distinct from "eolas" which translates as "knowledge", to refer to "information" in legislation.  The distinction is important in translations of legislation because both words can appear in the same sentence.  The word "faisnéis" has been used for many years to translate the word "information" into Irish — for example, An tAcht um Shaoráil Faisnéise or the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Deputies referred to the use of the word "faisnéis" in the context of "forecast".  The use of the word has been clarified by the translation service in the context of the word réamhfhaisnéis, as in réamhfhaisnéis na haimsire.  In this regard, "réamh" translates "beforehand" or "preliminary", rather than "forecast", and "fhaisnéis" translates as "information".  As we will discover in the next ten days or so, "cáin-fhaisnéis" is the Irish for "budget" and translates as "information about taxes".  The meaning of "faisnéis" in the <i>Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla</i> by Ó Dónaill is “information, intelligence, report”, including in legal references.  The translation service has explained that although “eolas” is often used to denote information in other situations, in the legislative context, “faisnéis” is the appropriate word to use to render “information”.  In light of this further consideration of the matter by the translation service, I believe we should continue to use the word “faisnéis”.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Deputies Stanton, Penrose, Dennehy, Lynch and others referred to resources.  In 2006, €24.36 million was allocated by the Department to fund services provided by Comhairle.  This includes €250,000 for the start-up of personal advocacy services and €150,000 for the preliminary work this year relating to interpretation services for deaf people.  A total of €2.012 million of the overall allocation has been provided specifically for the programme of support in the community and voluntary service.  By the end of 2006, 31 projects funded under the programme will be in place throughout the country.  We are committed to the progressive development of advocacy services to meet the needs of people with disabilities in line with the national disability strategy, to which some Deputies referred.  The Estimates provide for an allocation of €26.5 million for the citizens information board in 2007.  While further discussion and internal decisions are required, approximately €2.5 million of this amount will be used in respect of the advocacy service.  However, that figure needs to be finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Deputies also inquired about the research undertaken in respect of the demand for personal advocacy services.  A report on developing advocacy services for people with disabilities was published by Comhairle in July 2004.  This brought forward a great deal of independent evidence and research.  The consultation process undertaken as part of the work identified those who have the greatest need for advocacy services as people with intellectual disabilities, those who are mentally ill and, in particular, people with long-term illnesses.  These categories also include people with disabilities who are in residential institutions.  Data compiled for the report indicates 26,600 people are registered on the national intellectual disability database.  Of these, 9,200 are children.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">A total of 14,800 persons with mental or intellectual disabilities are in hospitals and full-time residential and community facilities.  People with disabilities in these categories who have difficulty in accessing social services without the support of a personal advocate will be prioritised by the new service.  It is important to recognise that many people with disabilities receive support from carers, parents, brothers and sisters who act in their best interest and insist on securing their needs.  In those cases an advocacy service may not be required but an application can still be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The future demand for personal advocacy services will be kept under constant review by the CIB and the Department.  The resources needed for this service will continue to be a priority in the annual Estimates and future budgets.  Consideration can be given to whatever further investment is needed in the service in the preparations for the upcoming budget.  I have outlined the resources needed to operate a professional and solid advocacy service nationally and we are committed to ensuring they will be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Deputy Stanton asked about the director and his staff, his remit, the service's location and recruitment.  It is planned that the director of the service and between four and six personal advocates and support staff will be recruited in the initial phase.  The director will initially be based in Dublin but, as decentralisation of the CIB's headquarters progresses, he or she and immediate staff will move to Drogheda.  The objective is to ensure a good regional spread of personal advocates initially.  The work of the personal advocates will involve meeting people in the personal advocacy service offices.  However, the intention is to provide an accessible service, which will involve working with people in their own residential setting if they require it.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Deputies Penrose, Stanton and others suggested the director should have responsibility for the support programme for services in the community and voluntary sectors and for the advocacy work the CIB undertakes supporting people in accessing information and advice about their entitlements.  I am advised by the board that the focus of attention of the director will be on the development of the new professional service to meet the needs of those most in need of the residential service.  The board will, however, review the operation of the personal advocacy service routinely.  It will continue to measure and assess the appropriateness of the structures in place as the service evolves.  The legislation requires that the Minister of the day should be advised about future structures and possibilities and that will be kept under constant review.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Many Members referred to the work of the personal advocate.  It is intended to provide a professional, high quality service.  The guiding principles will be independence and ensuring full monitoring of their work and activities.  In 2005 Comhairle published guidelines for the delivery of the service, which addressed many of the issues raised by Members about the quality, independence and professionalism which must be at the heart of the personal advocacy service.  That is the clear intention of the legislation and the clear wish of the House.  The need for quality will have to be followed through as the legislation evolves.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The guidelines also made suggestions about the skills and qualifications expected of a personal advocate.  Many Members asked what kind of people would be hired as personal advocates.  They are likely to be drawn from a variety of professions with experience of dealing with people with disabilities, many of whom will have been clients of theirs.  In general, advocates will probably be expected to have attained a third level qualification, a minimum of three years experience in a relevant area and good judgment.  The criteria will be developed as the advocates are sought.  I intend to table an amendment to section 5 on Committee Stage providing that the CIB must set out in broad terms the qualifications, skills and experience required to become a personal advocate.  Members were anxious that these should be laid out by the board well in advance and standards should be high.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I acknowledge the concerns of Members regarding people who may not be aware of the potential of the personal advocacy service because of their disability.  Action is planned on three levels to ensure a proactive, accessible service, which will be designed to target people with disabilities who are most in need of a personal advocate to speak on their behalf and to assist them in accessing the service.  The board will undertake a programme to promote awareness about the new facility.  Service providers such as general practitioners, public health nurses, social workers, hospital, residential and day care staff and public representatives will be targeted with information about the service.  The personal advocacy service will undertake training initiatives and hold seminars and meetings so that the service is widely promoted among those who work with people with disabilities, their carers and the wider public.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I intend to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  One will make provision for the director of the personal advocacy service to proactively follow up cases.  Members were concerned that this should happen, particularly in respect of people who are vulnerable and who might need a personal advocate.  I will propose a legal requirement to ensure the director will adopt a proactive rather than a passive approach.  I will also provide that anybody may apply on behalf of the person with the disability to the director of the personal advocacy service for the assignment of a personal advocate.  That is important in improving the effectiveness of the service.  I will make provision that, in such cases, the decision on qualification should be notified to both the applicant and the person who applies on his or her behalf.  I will elaborate on this during the Committee Stage debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I have asked the CIB to establish a committee, which should include representatives of disability interest groups, to advise the Minister on what further measures can be put in place at administrative level to ensure people with disabilities most in need of the new service are targeted for attention.  The programme of support for the development of advocacy services has a fundamental role in promoting knowledge and understanding of the contribution the service can make in representing people with disabilities.  At the end of the year, 31 projects will be in place throughout the State involving a range of organisations working with people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">For example, the community visitors programme to be introduced by the citizens information board in the coming years will provide another channel through which people with disabilities who may be in need of support can be helped to access the service of a personal advocate.  Everything possible will be done to ensure that whoever requires the service is aware of it and that the service can be applied for and made available with a minimum of bureaucracy and difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Volunteer community visitors will undertake regular visits to residential facilities, including respite care facilities, identify issues and problems from the perspective of the residents and refer cases to the personal advocacy service and community and voluntary organisations.  The citizens information board has set a target to recruit and train more than 100 volunteers in the coming years, which will allow for visits once per quarter to residences where there are people with disabilities.  If we need to increase the frequency of visits, the board can examine the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The provisions of the Bill, the board's plans to promote information on the advocacy service, the planned community visitors programme and the committee of the board established to advise me on additional measures amount to a proactive service that will target and identify the people with disabilities most in need of it to ensure that no stone is left unturned in bringing the advocacy service to their attention.  The amendments I will propose will try to give effect to this aim.  I have addressed the question concerning qualification criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">We will be able to quantify the demand for services as time passes.  There is a consensus in all of the research and the outcome of the consultation process that certain clients are more vulnerable than others.  It is intended to prioritise them during the initial stages.  Adults with learning disabilities, people with mental health issues, particularly those with long-term illnesses, and people with disabilities in residential institutions will have first call on the advocacy service.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The qualifying criteria for the assignment of a person has been devised to take account of these matters and to ensure that those who are most at risk of harm to their health and welfare have easy and ready access to the specialised personal advocacy service.  It is important that we not try to do everything initially.  The way in which the board shall determine the order of priority in the assignment of personal advocates is set out in section 5, the amendments to which will bring greater focus to the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I support the points made concerning the role of carers and the benefits they bring.  A considerable amount of progress and additional investment has been made in this regard and I would be surprised if the upcoming budget was not of further assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Many Deputies, including Deputies Lynch, Naughten and Stanton, raised the matter of the family income supplement or FIS.  A valuable service, it keeps many people who are on low incomes from slipping back to welfare payments and puts them on the ladder.  There are publicity initiatives in this regard.  For example, information on FIS is contained in all child benefit books, FIS entitlements are examined in respect of all back to work allowance applicants, information is given to all one-parent families when they are awarded one-parent family allowances and all employers have received information in PRSI mail shots.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I may discuss with officials whether there is scope to do more in respect of the FIS information contained in the tax clearance certificates issued by the Revenue Commissioners at the beginning of every year.  A box on the form mentions FIS, but there may be scope to do more.  People on low incomes who are in receipt of tax credits comprise our FIS client base.  I will discuss the matter with the Revenue Commissioners because, if agreement can be reached, using the Revenue database would be a strong way to promote FIS.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Deputies are aware that FIS is advertised in local and national newspapers and via outdoor posters and posters in every welfare office and post office and that there are freefone services and information in libraries.  It is heavily promoted.  As a result of the campaign asked for by Deputies, the number of recipients is increasing substantially.  On the week ending 3 November 2006, the latest date for which we have figures, 20,900 families were in receipt of FIS, the highest number on record.  To date in 2006, the Department has received 28,499 FIS applications compared to 19,368 applicants in the corresponding period in 2005.  I credit the additional awareness schemes and publicity with bringing in the additional number.  Deputies can take some credit because they raised the matter in the House constantly.  I will continue to maintain pressure to ensure that everyone who is entitled to FIS gets it.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I will gladly deal with any matter that I have not addressed.  The legislation is a modern rebranding and refocusing of the provision of information on a social service to everyone who requires it.  The legislation will be a leap forward in the provision of information via the Internet, telephones, e-mails, local offices and so on.  It delivers on the strong commitment of every Deputy to people with disabilities to do them the honour of ensuring that they receive the services to which they are entitled.  It will introduce a new era of providing an advocate to any person with a disability who needs access to State services, which is the least a civilised society can do at this stage of its development.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their welcome for and consideration of the legislation.  We can tease out a number of issues on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_294">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I welcome the opportunity to address Dáil Éireann on Second Stage of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2006, which provides that a foster parent or a relative who has had a child in his or her care for a period of five years, the child having been placed with him or her by the Health Service Executive, may apply for a court order for increased autonomy in respect of the care of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I am pleased to note that this legislation has been passed by Seanad Éireann, subject to a small number of amendments.  I thank Senators for their contribution to the Bill and for the worthwhile debate on the issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Child welfare and protection policy is grounded in the principle that children who cannot, for whatever reason, live with their own families are provided with an appropriate alternative.  As Deputies are aware, studies have shown that the development of a child is best achieved in a loving family environment, which foster care can provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Foster care is the main form of alternative care provided by the Health Service Executive for children in need of care and protection.  Our latest statistics, as of December 2004, establish that over 5,000 children and young people are currently in the care of the Health Service Executive.  Almost 4,250, or 84%, of these children are in foster care.  This represents an increase of 4% on the previous year's figures.  This increase in foster care is welcome and is in line with Government policy.  The number of children in residential care declined by almost 2%, from 527 to 442, between 2003 and 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">These figures show the critical importance of the foster care services in our child protection and welfare service.  Families and family life are very important to all children and the opportunity to experience the qualities of family life is one of the main objectives of the national children's strategy.  For those children who cannot be looked after in their own families and who need to be provided with alternative care, foster care provides the best way for them to experience family life.  The challenge is to provide an appropriate response to this vulnerable group of children.  This response must respect their rights to a childhood in a secure family environment so that they may fulfil their potential in adulthood.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">In 2003 I launched a study undertaken by the former Eastern Region Health Authority entitled Counting on Foster Care — a comprehensive and detailed census of alternative family placement providers in the eastern region.  The study outlined the varied routes taken by foster carers into the provision of such care.  It is an in-depth examination of their views on the service they provide and the assistance they are given in providing that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">One of the main features of this study was the broad range of information and statistics it had collated on foster carers.  For example, the study indicated that in February 2001 up to 40% of foster care placements in the three area health boards were with relatives.  This was considerably higher than the percentage of relative placement providers in England, at 12%, or Scotland, at 10%.  This is a welcome finding as research has shown consistently positive outcomes for children fostered with relatives.  The study showed that the range of motives of foster carers encompassed altruism and personal aspirations.  Another point of interest was the range of individuals involved in foster care from all branches of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I was pleased to note that most carers found the experience of fostering enjoyable and that any concerns they had prior to fostering had been alleviated.  The indications are that there are significant benefits to be derived from the fostering experience, for both the children and foster carer families.  This provides us with valuable information for the recruitment of foster carers, with fostering being promoted as having something to offer not only to the children in care but to the foster families themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The foster care allowance has been substantially increased from €90.85 per week for children under 12 years of age in August 2001 to €305 per week currently and from €108.88 per week for children aged 12 years and over to €334 per week currently.  This increase has alleviated the need for foster parents to apply to the Health Service Executive for every extra financial need of their foster child or children.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Children in foster care are in the care of the State under the Child Care Act 1991 and foster carers undertake to care for these children on the State's behalf.  As such they are a unique group in unique circumstances.  The allowance is paid to foster carers for the benefit of the foster child and cannot therefore be considered an income or an income support.  The allowance is paid in recognition of the obligations placed on foster carers to meet the standards set out in the care plan and to meet the standards set out in the national foster care standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Using all of these arguments, last year I sought to have the allowance included in the list of payments which are specified in the Finance Act as being exempt from income tax.  I am pleased to say that I was successful and that these payments, as outlined in the Finance Act 2005, are exempt from income tax and shall not be taken into account in computing total income for the purpose of income tax legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">As a result of this Bill foster parents and relatives who have had a child in their care for a period of five years will no longer have to seek the permission of the Health Service Executive when certain decisions have to be made relating to the child.  For example, they will not have to obtain permission to seek medical or dental treatment for a child or permission for a child to receive an immunisation or go on a school tour.  The proposals outlined in the Bill will help to avoid the possible stigmatisation of these children in school contexts where they currently have to wait for longer than their peers or classmates for such permissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Two new sections, 43A and 43B, will be inserted into Part VI of the Child Care Act 1991.  Section 43A(1) provides that a foster parent or relative may apply for a court order whether the child is in care on a voluntary basis under section 4 of the principal Act or is the subject of a care order under section 18 of that Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Section 43A(2) sets out the conditions on which the court must be satisfied before granting such an order.  The child must have been in the care of the foster parent or relative for a period of five years; the granting of the order must be in the best interests of the child; and the Health Service Executive must consent.  The parents having custody or the person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> must have consented if the child is in voluntary care and must be informed if the child is the subject of a care order.  If the child is in voluntary care the parents who have surrendered the child into care have the right to veto any further step involving the transfer of rights.  A court will have to take the decision on a person taken into the care of the HSE.  The child’s wishes must also be taken into account in so far as is practicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Section 43A(3) provides that any interruption of the placement during that period of five years should be disregarded unless that interruption exceeds 30 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Section 43A(4) provides that the conditions relating to the notification or consent of the parent having custody or the person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> do not apply if the parent or the person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> is missing or cannot be found by the Health Service Executive, or the court so directs having regard to the child’s best interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Section 43A(5) provides that, subject to any conditions imposed by the court, an order granted authorises the foster parent or relative to whom it is granted, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, to have like control over the child as if it were the child's parent and to do what is reasonable to safeguard and promote the child's health, welfare and development.  In addition the foster parent or relative is authorised under the order to give consent to any medical or psychiatric examination, treatment or assessment and to the issue of a passport or passport facilities for the child.  The court may impose such conditions or restrictions as it thinks fit as to the extent of the authority granted.  Consent given by a foster parent or relative to whom such an order has been granted will be sufficient authority for the carrying out of the medical or psychiatric examination, assessment or treatment or for the provision of a passport or passport facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Section 43A(8) provides that where a foster parent or relative refuses to give consent in accordance with an order made under this Part, the Health Service Executive will have authority to give consent in accordance with section 18(3) of the principal Act.  That is an essential safeguard in legislation of this type.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Section 43A(9) provides that any consent permissible under section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 will continue to be an effective consent.  Section 23 of that Act provides that a minor who has reached the age of 16 years may consent to any surgical, medical or dental treatment.  That is the age of consent for medical purposes in our general legislation and it is important to translate and preserve that principle in the context of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Section 43A(10) provides that any access arrangements in place before the granting of an order under this section will continue unless the court orders otherwise in accordance with section 37 of the principal Act.  Section 43A(11) provides that, notwithstanding subsection (10), a court can at any time vary or discharge an access order, including an order which was continued or varied under subsection (10).</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Section 43A(12) provides that any other functions of the Health Service Executive relating to the interest of a child, for example care planning, in accordance with any other provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 or regulations made under the Act will continue in force.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Section 43A(13) provides a definition of relevant time as being the time, in the case of a child in voluntary care, immediately before the child is taken into care and in the case of a child in care under a care order, immediately before the order is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Section 43B(1) provides that the court may vary or discharge an order made under this section on the application of the Health Service Executive, the person to whom the order was granted, a parent having custody at the time the child came into care or a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Section 43B(2) sets out the circumstances where an order granted under this section may cease to have effect.  These include where a child in voluntary care returns to their parents or another person, where a care order is discharged, a child is adopted, a child is removed from the custody of the foster parent or relative by the Health Service Executive, the foster parent or relative requests that the child be removed by the Health Service Executive or the child concerned reaches 18 years of age or marries.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Part V of the Child Care Act 1991, which deals with jurisdictional proceedings, applies to proceedings taken under part VI and the new provisions will be in Part VI.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The importance the Government attaches to foster care was underlined by the publication in 2001 of the report of the working group on foster care, Foster Care: A Child-Centred Partnership.  The report pointed the way forward to strengthening and developing the service and provided the guidelines to improve standards in foster care.  Building on this work, national standards for foster care were published in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Since the publication of the standards the social services inspectorate has carried out a national audit and a pilot inspection of foster care services.  The pilot inspection considered three of the standards of practice.  Three community care areas nominated by the former health boards were inspected against these standards.  These were located in the Health Service Executive eastern, southern and western regions.  The sample group covered both urban and rural areas.  The case files of a total of 56 children and young persons were considered during the inspection, representing approximately one third of the total number of children in foster care in the three areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">On the basis of the information yielded by the pilot study, inspectors found that each of the community care areas provided a good foster care service.  The inspectors found that the foster care service provided stability and continuity of care for the children and young people, with the majority of children having spent on average three quarters of their time in care in their current placement.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The inspection found that the services provided children and young people in foster care with an opportunity to maintain links with their families of origin.  It was noted that over one third of the children and young people were placed with relative carers and two thirds of the children were living with at least one sibling at the time of the inspection.  These figures were viewed as a demonstration of the former health boards' clear commitment to maintaining the connection between children and young people in the foster care system and their families of origin.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Each of the 56 children and young people had an allocated social worker and the inspectors found that the social workers provided a good service to the children.  They visited them regularly and often helped them come to terms with the reasons that they came into care.  They also maintained a high level of contact with the foster carers to provide them with support.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">This was a pilot inspection.  When the social services inspectorate is established on a statutory basis, it will be in a position to broaden the range of inspections undertaken against the national standards for foster care so we can ensure that services of the highest standard are provided throughout the country.  I mention all of this to alleviate any concerns Members may have about the proposals outlined in the Bill.  The proposals very sensibly give the foster parents greater autonomy in regard to the practical day-to-day care of the children entrusted to them.  However, the children remain in the care of the HSE, which is responsible for their overall well-being and protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">To be effective service providers we must have a long-term vision for the children in our care.  We must empower these young persons while they are in foster care so they can be happy, secure and successful adults in society.  The proposals in the Bill will help to give them a greater sense of belonging in a family where their foster parents are responsible for many of the practical decisions affecting their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">On a related matter, the adoption (Hague Convention, adoption authority and miscellaneous provisions) Bill. which is currently being drafted, will ratify the Hague Convention, bringing it into force under Irish law.  The legislation will also establish the Adoption Board as an independent statutory body known as the Adoption Authority.  The issue of the adoption of a person who is 18 years or more by the person's long-term foster carers is one of the issues I have under consideration in the context of the Bill.  I am anxious to make legal provision in this regard.  It can be done within our constitutional framework and would be of considerable assistance to foster parents and their children who wish to take that course of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I wish to inform the House of other matters which I hope to address on Committee Stage.  All of these matters are within the scope and purpose of the child care legislation and the primary Act of 1991.  The Government attaches a very high priority to the report of the Ferns Inquiry and to following up on the report's recommendations in the context of ensuring that effective child protection and welfare systems are in place to protect children.  Before the publication of the Ferns Report, I sought the advice of the Attorney General on the report, including the issue of the Health Service Executive's powers in regard to third party abuse, which was raised in it.  The advice was that the executive had general powers under the Child Care Act 1991 regarding third party abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">In line with the recommendations, however, it was considered that the Department of Health and Children, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, should undertake an in-depth study of the HSE's powers in regard to third party abuse and that this would be followed by legislative proposals as required.  Following further detailed discussions between my office and the Attorney General on the question of conducting the in-depth examination of these issues, my office and the Health Service Executive are examining in detail the various issues involved.  I hope to conclude this process in the near future.  The advice of the Attorney General will be sought on the outcome of these deliberations.  Subject to Government approval, I will then publish legislative proposals relating to outstanding recommendations of the Ferns Report, in so far as they relate to legislative change and the Office of the Minister for Children, for inclusion on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I also wish to introduce further legislative proposals which would provide for school age child care to come within the requirements of the Child Care Act 1991 in the same way as the pre-school services.  I am also examining the guardian <i>ad litem</i> service, which is provided under the Child Care Act 1991, as to whether it is possible to secure a greater uniformity of provision in this service.  I will revert to the House on Committee Stage about these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I am happy to commend this Bill to the House.  I believe it provides for progressive social change in our foster care system.  Over the decades, the number of children in secure long-term care has increased.  There is a definite cohort of children in long-term foster care and it is important that their foster parents have a measure of stability regarding decisions they make on their behalf.  It is also important that we lay the foundation for the further change of permitting the adoption of these children in appropriate circumstances and in their best interests.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_332">I support this important legislation.  We should take this opportunity to give credit to foster parents.  They are a unique group of people in Irish society.  Not everybody would or could do the work they do.  They care for children <i> in loco parentis</i>.  It is a difficult role because many of these children have difficulties, including behavioural difficulties.  It is interesting that there are 5,000 children in care.  There are more children in the care of the HSE than are attending primary schools in my constituency of County Wexford at present.  That is a dramatic number.  We seldom acknowledge the huge number of children in care.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Social workers should also see their role and ethos praised.  There has been much criticism of some of the people who work in the HSE and social workers often bear the brunt of that criticism with regard to the care of children.  There is a need to reinforce the ethos of social workers, which must also be <i>in loco parentis</i>.  They see many terrible things and the difficulties that occur in families.  Like all of us in the House, they can get despondent and despair that any of the problems can be corrected.  People lose the will to do their job in the way they have been trained to do it.  It is important to give credit to social workers; their job is extremely difficult.  I hope they maintain the important ethos that what they do must be in the best interests of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">My main criticism of this legislation is the five year rule.  Five years is too long.  Two or three years should be more than enough.  I am not sure why the Minister decided on a five year period.  If a child is going to bond with his or her foster parents, it will usually happen relatively quickly.  It would be a mark of respect both to the child and the foster parent if that period were shortened.  That would better serve the interests of the children involved.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why he decided on the relatively long period of five years before the foster parent can take care of a child as if it was his or her own.  When the bonding process works well, it can happen over the course of a few months.  It would be a mark of respect for both sides if we passed legislation that would acknowledge the bonding of the child and foster parent by permitting the extra responsibilities in a shorter duration of time.  The period should be between two and three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I commend the Minister on his hard work.  The Minister of State is obviously extremely dedicated to the job he does and puts a good deal of effort into the legislation he has been working on since he was given special responsibility for children.  When one reflects on the hard work he must be doing behind the scenes in terms of trying to get this type of legislation right so that it will endure for the future, one concludes that it takes up a great deal of personal time, quite apart from his work time.  Often very little credit is given to Members of this House who work hard on what they were elected to do, namely, formulate legislation and get it through the Oireachtas.  While a certain amount of work is done on this side of the House, I acknowledge that it is probably easier for us to go through a piece of legislation with a view to exposing its problems.  However, that is what democracy is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">My concern about this Bill is similar to the position I hold on other Ministers, namely, the lack of legislation in this area.  When one reflects on the whole Leas Cross debate in terms of protecting elderly people, it was not as if many of these problems were not known about or were unmentioned in numerous Government documents.  There has been talk about protecting the elderly with an expanded social services inspectorate.  While the Government is looking at HIQA legislation, I believe a different approach should be taken.  Even on funding for the elderly for the future, all such concerns formed key arguments in Government documents as far back as 2001.  Yet nothing has been done about the protection of elderly patients in the last five years.  To me it was amazing to find out yesterday that two years since its establishment the reforming HSE, which is supposed to make the health service better, still does not have full regulations in place to operate a complaints procedure.  Even its corporate governance was not signed off until recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">I hope that does not happen in this regard.  I shall really commend the Minister of State if he brings forward changes to the legislation on Committee Stage which are based on the recommendations made in the Ferns Report.  I give credit to him, nonetheless, in so far as he is attempting to bring such matters forward quickly.  Far too many Ministers are sitting on reports four or five years old which make recommendations to change legislation, while they come out with glib responses and soundbites for the media.  They are not doing the hard work they need to do, and are not delivering on legislation.  When this Bill is being debated on Committee Stage, I hope the Minister of State will bring forward good solid commitments to protect children in our society on the basis of the Ferns Report recommendations, because of the enormous number of scandals to do with children in recent years.  In the event, we will give the Minister of State all the support he needs.  I hope he will fight, too, from within Government, to get the social services inspectorate properly up and running — to get the Ministers concerned to do what they are supposed to do.  It is not a matter of opening off-licences or glad-handing around the country, rather it is about getting appropriate legislation though the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The Leas Cross scandal would never have happened if the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had been more awake regarding his job.  That is definitely true.  Those types of nursing homes would have been closed long ago.  He would not have destroyed the reputations of an enormous number of nursing homes throughout the country if he had been doing his job, instead of posing as a glamour boy for the media.  The HSE is not without its imperfections, as has been discerned over the last 20 months.  The Minister of State said the onus was on the HSE to provide the necessary supports for carers.  It is extremely important to know what precisely the HSE is doing to give supports to carers and people who are vulnerable.  The dead hand of officialdom is demoralising social workers and everybody in the health service.  In a recent case, when a carer looking after children with intellectual disabilities implied to the HSE that he might do something criminal, its response was equivalent to that of a squad team, kicking in doors, bringing in gardaí and social workers and generally overreacting.  That person was trying to express a cry for help, and the HSE must recognise that the onus of responsibility is to deliver the services for people who are carers.  It should not react in the manner of a police state when people become exasperated because nothing is happening.  That is the next thing on which the Minister of State needs to focus his attention.  He must ensure that the resources are available for the HSE and that it does its job.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Mr. Aidan Browne, the HSE's national director of community care, attended the Joint Committee on Health and Children yesterday and talked about issues regarding the elderly.  He used a soft non-confrontational voice, which nearly lulled the committee members to sleep.  The only trouble was that most of us who deal with the HSE were very angry with Mr. Browne's attitude.  We know he has been trying to give the impression that he has been doing everything humanly possible, when he was doing nothing.  He was writing letters and articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>, indicating that the HSE was doing everything it possibly could and pleading that people were misquoting him.  Two weeks later he was exposed in an official report and changed the bar again.  I will not fall for any of that old nonsense from the HSE, and Deputy Brian Lenihan, as the Minister of State with responsibility for children, should ensure that the resources are in place for it to do its job properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">There is no point in having the best legislation in the world or a Minister of State who is genuinely committed to children if the HSE falls down on its responsibilities.  Its responsibilities include having the resources and keeping up the morale of the people it employs whether social workers, administrators or foster parents.  It must ensure they have the help they require to look after these children.  The figure is enormous — 5,000 children.  We do not want to see the lives of 5,000 children damaged in any way because we do not fulfil our commitments, and that is extremely important.  I know many of these children have no difficulties.  They go into great families or stay with relatives.  As a former general practitioner I have plenty of experience of children taken into care.  It can be quite chaotic because in many instances the parents want to take their children back from foster care.  One always tries to give the benefit of the doubt, but unfortunately that often fails.  That is another thing the HSE must be careful about.  The pendulum can swing both ways.  Sometimes we get too liberal and children are damaged.  Sometimes the pendulum swings the other way, we are too conservative and restrict children from going back to their families.  That is why the lines of communication must be kept open.  If we are very open and transparent about what we do, we can always allow ourselves to give the benefit of the doubt.  We can allow children to go back, not just to have contact with the natural parents.  Such initiative can also fail of course.  There are problems arising from drink, drugs and relationships and people have problems coping.  Some of these young and not-so-young parents who put children into foster care are just not capable of looking after them at a young age.  All these difficulties must be acknowledged but they must be approached in a humane rather than a hardline official manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I have seen great people do this work, some of them extremely poor.  They bring their prejudices with them and often display a tendency to cover themselves in the face of establishment diktats, which is not necessarily in the best interest of the people involved.  There are also problems with the courts.  The Minister of State should look at the way the courts are working.  He is well aware of some of these issues.  Others hit the headlines, such as access to children by fathers, or judgments almost written in stone where nobody has the courage to ask whether the right decisions had been taken.  I have seen both mothers and fathers denied access to children, even where parents had radically changed their former behaviour regarding alcohol or drug abuse.  They might have been wild young tearaways but have settled down.  What is said in court about parents who were formerly engaged in alcohol or drug abuse, or who were wild in their youth, sticks to them for the rest of their lives, even when they settle down.  Opinions of them are biased forever.  We therefore need to consider how the courts operate.  Politicians and general practitioners often use a lot more common sense than the letter of the law might prescribe.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Consider the recent row between the Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Tim O'Malley, and the professors of psychiatry.  Too many people take up positions on either end of the spectrum and this does nobody any good.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, needs to consider how the courts operate so their judgments will be more child friendly.  The Deputy has great legal knowledge and this should be used to the maximum benefit in the House to deliver the political outcomes we always seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Many children are still in poverty.  We can argue until the cows come home about relative and absolute poverty but the fact remains that many children are not getting the best from life.  It is not necessarily a question of money.  It is sometimes stated children are impoverished because their parents are spending so much on drink or are not spending money appropriately but it is sometimes the case that they cannot cope.  The Minister of State should therefore promote the concept of parenting courses among the members of Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">A great study was carried out in the United States some years ago.  The practitioners concerned were testing a trial drug for ADHD, which is disruptive behaviour in young children.  The parents of the recruited children had to do a parenting course but while they were doing so half the children had to be taken off the drug because their behaviour improved dramatically.  It was discovered that their condition was largely influenced by their parents not being able to carry out their parental duties as well as they believed they could.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Society is changing dramatically.  There are more one-parent families than there were traditionally and the social cohesion that existed even a decade ago has declined.  The extended family unit is not as prevalent as it used to be.  Both parents work nowadays and some live in opposite parts of the country.  Not all parents are in middle-income, two-car households but are often in lower-income groups.  Many of those receiving family income supports are among the working poor.  Perhaps they could benefit from my proposals.  We should take a wider view of why children end up in care or are disruptive in school, and of why parents are having difficulties.  We should determine ways to help them, including parenting courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The Taoiseach announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that he wanted to hold the referendum on children's right next February or March.  I am sure it came as a great shock to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, because it certainly came as a great shock to me.  On the basis of my preparatory work for the referendum and that of my colleagues who have more responsibility in this area, I felt the issue was so broad that we could not determine the wording to be inserted into the Constitution so soon.  I was therefore quite surprised by the Taoiseach's statement and felt he must have received some extraordinary advice on how to change the Constitution.  He may have received some of it from the Minister of State.  I would certainly not like to believe somebody is attempting to use children for political gain or flying a kite in that regard.  Perhaps we will hear more about this from the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">This legislation is relatively straightforward.  Nobody would have any great difficulties with what has been presented to us so far.  The period in question should be shortened and the rights of children should be considered more broadly.  I hope the Minister of State will make appropriate amendments on Committee Stage on foot of the recommendations in the Ferns Report.  I hope he will push for other legislative measures to meet the needs of children before the Government leaves office some time next April or May and that he will ensure the HSE structure protects children.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">We should consider expanding parenting courses for those who need them.  This is done in an <i>ad hoc </i>way across the country.  Certain voluntary groups and other organisations funded by the HSE conduct them.  It is necessary to talk to social workers who act <i>in loco parentis</i> and administrators in the HSE so we will not swing the pendulum too broadly.  Nobody wants a repeat of the Cleveland affair in the Irish system, nor does anyone want to return to the days that produced the incident in Kilkenny so many years ago, which is driving much of the work we are doing today.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_349">Having listened to Deputy Twomey, I find it amazing that everyone has a different view on children and that one always believes one's own advice is the best and should be followed.  I would not disagree with 90% of what the Deputy said, but I would disagree with some points.  For example, I believe our current position on rights, scrutiny and inspectorates has been informed by our historical position.  We were in a terribly dark place in Ireland from the 1930s to the 1970s.  Some of the reports on institutional abuse cover incidents dating right up to the early 1970s.  We regarded certain groups in society as untouchable, beyond reproach and like Caesar's wife.  They were not then and are not now.  If we again believe that social workers, general practitioners, politicians, nuns and priests are perfect, it will not be long until we are back in a terribly dark place.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Following on my point that everyone believes one's own prescription for the future is correct, some 5% of individuals in positions that fall under the remit of this Bill are not good enough at what they do.  They are corrupt and in the wrong profession.  If we always bear this in mind, we will always be conscious that we may be placing our trust in an individual who is not capable of doing his or her job.  We must be very careful about this.  I had an experience with social workers that Stephen King could have written as a horror story.  A situation was brought to my attention by very concerned people, whom I consider neither right nor left but sober individuals, who witnessed a situation developing in which a child was at risk.  They felt that they could not stand by and allow it to continue.  I went to the health board and said that I thought the child required additional support and that the board should ensure that it was protected.  I was acting not as a family member but as a member of the public.  The very senior social worker involved arrived at the house, and the first thing that she did was tell the family who had made the complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I inquired about her name, which I will not give here, since I do not do that sort of thing.  Naturally, the family was very upset, and I do not blame them.  However, it turned out that the social worker had been assigned to the family and had not done her job.  The reason that she was so upset was that she had been found out, although I could not have known that at the time.  The upshot was that she was promoted.</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_353">She was promoted.  A big plus is that she is no longer directly involved with children.  That is why I am such a great believer in whistleblowers' charters, which we should have in all aspects of life.  I could not believe what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I look at people doing jobs.  With experience, and having got to know people, one knows whether they are good and have the requisite interest.  My instinct is not to trust a person on the first meeting.  Perhaps that is a bad way to be, but it reflects my experience.  I recently met a couple well into their 50s who had four small children with them.  They were lovely children, well cared for and clearly very comfortable in the family situation, draped over the woman, who might have been their mother or grandmother.  They turned out to be four foster children.  It was an entire family made up of a diverse group but clearly very comfortable in one another's company and well cared for.  That is the ideal for which we strive.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">In those circumstances, this Bill is ideal, since it grants a kind of autonomy to those parents and reassures the children by stating that those whom they consider their parents, for whatever length of time, are there in times of crisis and emergency to tell them what to do without the drawn-out, bureaucratic nightmare of having to contact health boards or social workers, 95% of whom are good.  The Bill is very good from that perspective.  I started by saying that we all feel that we have the panacea regarding how children should be reared, what the future holds for them and what we should be doing as a society to protect them.  None of us has that, since no child comes with a label stating how it should be washed, fed or reared; they are individuals like everyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The Supreme Court decision of two weeks ago was an awful tragedy, and not just for the natural parents or those who cared for the child for two years.  The dust will settle and things will come right, but the hurt will never go away, on either side.  When one examines the detail of the case and considers the fact that the request for the child to be returned was made very early, one sees that it was not the fault of the adoptive or the biological parents.  It was the fault of those in between, and sometimes people are inclined to believe that their vision of an individual's future is right and that only their prescription will work.  However, that is not so.  What happened in the case in question should be a lesson to us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I mentioned the four children I met recently and their very loving foster parents.  However, we must be very careful that fostering, good as it is, is not adoption.  It can progress thereto, but it is not the same thing.  Some people place their children in care voluntarily because they simply cannot cope with the daily stress of their lives.  Most of them do so on a short-term basis.  It may not turn out to be short-term, but most do so with that intention.  They ask for a month to get themselves back on their feet.  It may take longer — and they may never quite be in a position to take their children back full-time — but they never place their children in care expecting it to continue until the child is an adult.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">We must be very careful of the balance.  The orders made are very good, and five years is a suitable period.  It is not too short or too long.  Let us imagine that a child is placed in foster care at three months, which I believe is the most common age.  It will be five, going to school, settling into a community, and the biological parents at that stage have probably reached some kind of conclusion regarding where the child will be.  The health board, if it is not a voluntary care order, will definitely have done so by that stage.  However, the conclusion should not be reached any sooner.  There is a difference, and one must be extremely careful of the natural parents' rights.  We do not want the situation to arise where an order is made that people find very hard to reverse.  Further important protection is provided by the fact that an access order can also be made after the residency orders have been granted.  It is not a barrier to the biological parents having access to their children.  The shutters do not come down, but a mechanism is provided whereby foster parents exercise more autonomy in the lives of the children for whom they care.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I see from the transcript of the debate in the Seanad that the Minister agreed to consider the list of people with a bona fide interest in a child's life.  I agree that the list should perhaps be more precise, including the immediate family and siblings.  However, we must do something about grandparents' rights.  They need not necessarily be included in the Bill, but they must be examined with the utmost care.  As Deputy Twomey said, apart from when the child is very young and the arrangement is voluntary, a child usually enters care at a fairly chaotic time in its life, and that may be why fostering can take some time to settle.  The grandparents may very well be the only stable point in the child's life at that stage.  I have seen cases where grandparents, seeing that there is chaos in the family home, have pursued the health board, now the HSE, to ensure the child's best interests are taken on board and that he or she is taken into care.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Grandparents have a special role to play.  Not all grandparents find themselves in the situation I described but we must make some provision for situations where children are placed in care even though they have grandparents who wish to be involved in their care.  It is unacceptable that a child who has lived with his or her grandparents for several years may end up in foster care and the grandparents have no right of access.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I agree with the Minister of State that the list of people with a bona fide interest in a child's life must be precise.  Grandparents should be included on that list so they can apply to the court for access.  My heart goes out to grandparents who, having enjoyed a close relationship with their grandchild, must then endure the sudden cutting off of that relationship.  This happens not only in foster care situations but also in cases, for example, where one of the child's parents remarries and the new spouse, usually contrary to the child's wishes, does not want the grandparents involved in his or her life.  We must be farsighted in dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Family life is changing dramatically but it should not be beyond the wit of legislators to regulate these social changes.  Like Deputy Twomey, I was amazed to hear the Taoiseach speak about a referendum on children's rights.  It is not that simple.  One cannot simply put together a formula of words on which everyone will agree.  The best interests of children should be at the heart of everything that affects their welfare.  I am not certain, however, that we can devise a formula of words for insertion in the Constitution that will ensure that.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">We spent two years trying to secure constitutional rights for people with disabilities, including children.  We were told by a succession of Ministers, however, that this type of constitutional provision could not be made and would be unenforceable.  How can the Taoiseach now tell us that it will be done in regard to children's rights by means of a simple formula of words before the next election?  If it can be done in this instance, why was it not done in respect of people with disabilities, a more manageable and readily identifiable group?</p>
          <p eId="para_364">More than 5,000 children are currently resident in various types of care.  I am always astonished this figure is not higher given that the supports provided by extended family networks are generally no longer in place.  Moreover, communities are not as strong as they were, although the situation is not as bad as is usually suggested.  The way in which we manage children in care is vitally important.  If these children have a good experience of childhood, a good education and emerge into adulthood as well rounded people, they can play an important part in society.  On the other hand, we know what happens when children are treated poorly.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The family to whom I referred, comprising the parents and four foster children, told me they were planning to go on a holiday.  That is why I am particularly interested in the passport issue.  I can only imagine the hoops these parents had to go through to secure passports for their four children, who were all close in age.  It is vitally important that foster parents are able to give permission for children to go abroad for limited periods of time, on school trips, for example.  Children who have not had the best start in life need more support to make up for the difficulties they face.  This is why the role of grandparents can be particularly important.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">It is not reasonable or acceptable that any judge should be expected to hear cases regarding drink driving, assaults, neighbours' disputes and so on all morning and then have to deal with family law matters in the afternoon.  It is a specialised area that requires a specialised approach.  Such hearings should not take place in the court house in Cork or elsewhere where defendants in criminal cases are in handcuffs.  The cases are different and should be treated as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Serious and careful consideration should be given to the introduction of a magistrate system such as that which exists in Britain, which avails of the expertise of psychologists and specialists in family law in an informal setting.  This would remove some of the stress from proceedings and would undoubtedly better serve those involved in family law cases.  We must seriously consider the introduction of specialised sittings for family law matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">I agree with the Minister of State's observation in the Seanad that the list of persons who could apply for access to a child should be clearly defined.  This is a good and workable Bill so long as the sensitivity of the biological parents is not interfered with in any way and that people are not led to believe that foster care is some type of short-term adoption.  In the aftermath of the recent Supreme Court decision in the Baby Ann case and other cases, we must be sensitive to both sides while always bearing in mind that our priority should be the best interests of the child.  It is that which should always guide us.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_371">I thank the Minister of State for outlining these proposals in detail.  He will have the full support of the House for this Bill.  I will not speak for long because most of the issues have been covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">One of the main functions of this legislation is to ensure foster carers are not obliged to obtain permission to seek medical or dental treatment or immunisation for a child, or to allow the child to travel abroad for a school trip, for example.  The proposals in this Bill will prevent the stigmatisation of foster children.  We cannot underestimate the feelings of alienation of foster children among their peer group.  It can be painful for them if they are placed further outside the loop because of issues like this.  The legislation closes that gap which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">In the Seanad the Minister of State saluted the work of foster parents.  All Members should pay tribute to foster families.  We were reminded how important their work is when we learned that the children of the recently murdered Latvian lady were to be put in foster care.  One can only imagine the trauma these children are suffering.  We ought to bear in mind the difficulties with which their foster parents will have to contend.  These children are now without their mother and with people they do not know.  Likewise, the new foster parents are with strange children with whom they will try to forge a bond in difficult circumstances.  This legislation breaks down bureaucratic barriers for simple matters in fostering, allowing foster children to feel more at one with their foster parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The Minister of State claimed the Bill's proposals would give young people in foster care a sense of belonging in a foster family.  He referred to the adoption of the Hague Convention and the adoption authority Bill.  This legislation will establish the Adoption Board as an independent statutory body known as the adoption authority.  When will this Bill be published, as it is an important part of family law?</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The Minister of State stated he sought the advice of the Attorney General on the issue of the HSE's powers with regard to third party abuses as raised in the Ferns Report.  The HSE had general powers under the Child Care Act 1991 regarding third party abuse.  An in-depth study on the HSE's powers in this area has been undertaken and the Minister of State is considering legislative proposals.  Will he outline the proposals he has in mind?  When discussing the protection of our children, this is an important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I compliment the Minister of State on the Bill.  If a strong body of legislation to protect our children can be brought together, we will all, particularly the Minister of State, have done the State some service.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_377">I am not too old to remember the orphanages in the 1970s.  I was in a class in Goldenbridge for a year where there were orphans from Keogh Square, Inchicore.  It left an indelible mark on me concerning poverty and the lives of children who had no parental support, a different experience to mine.  In those days, there was an expectation that adults always acted in the interests of children.  Unfortunately, a substantial number of notorious cases have highlighted that at times neither adults nor the State acted in the interests of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The legislation is thoughtful.  The Minister of State is sincere in his drive to put in place a body of legislation for child protection.  Apart from legislation, support networks are needed in this area.  Last week, I was impressed when Nora Gibbons of Barnardo's noted that in the Baby Ann case there were lawyers for the prospective adoptive parents and the natural parents but none for the child.  One cannot describe a situation as child-centred without having a mechanism that will put the child on an equal footing with other parties.  This absence needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I sat on the Commission on the Family for three years.  With the amount of documentation presented to it, my eyesight almost suffered.  My experience with the commission highlighted how difficult it would be to frame a constitutional formula in this area.  The commission spent weeks simply trying to agree a definition for the family.  We came to the conclusion it could not be given a definite legal term but a description as something to be nurtured and supported.  It was the family function we focused on rather than a legal definition.  It will be difficult to find suitable wording for the constitutional referendum on children's rights.  While I believe there is a need for the referendum, the terminology and balance must be got right.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I agree with Deputy Lynch on the role of grandparents.  While I accept the Bill may not provide the legislative context for their role, with people living longer, grandparents play a major role in a child's upbringing.  While I was not fortunate enough to really know my grandparents, my children knew, and still know, theirs very well.  To be disconnected from grandparents can be a major loss in a child's life.  Given the number of children born to non-married couples, the rights of unmarried fathers must be recognised.  This comes down to what is in the interests of the child.  If we genuinely see the interest of the child as being central, one can see the richness a grandparent and father can bring to it.  We must move away from family conflicts and find mechanisms to help families to engage with their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Constitution determines the definition of the family and a foster parent is very much <i>in loco parentis</i>, not on the same footing as a natural parent.  Foster parents have told me they have been fulfilled by the role they have played but have felt there were legal and cultural difficulties in them acting in the interests of the child. Some of the provisions in this Bill will address that issue.  Giving permission for a child to go on a school tour is a good case in point.  There is also an attitude to be addressed to ensure that people do not treat a foster parent differently.  It is difficult enough for foster parents to feel part of a semi-permanent arrangement without meeting other obstacles highlighting that difference which are not in the child’s interest.  This may not be a legal issue only but also a cultural one.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_382">Ba mhaith liom a rá that I welcome this Bill as a further necessary reform of legislation regarding the care of children and the rights and responsibilities of foster parents and of relatives caring for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Much attention has recently been paid to the need to vindicate further the rights of children.  It is a pity that this arose in the somewhat confusing way occasioned by the Taoiseach's announcement at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis of the Government's intention to better enshrine children's rights in the Constitution.  With respect, the statements of an tAire Stáit, as well as those of the Taoiseach, have left us none the wiser as to whether the Government really intends to hold such a referendum before the dissolution of this Dáil.  That is the critical point which the Aire Stáit might clarify at the end of this debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_188" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_384">I have already written to the Deputy.  My door is open.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_385">I know but I hope the Aire Stáit will clarify this for us.  Much of the work regarding placing children's rights in the Constitution has already been done.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution in 2004 and 2005 reviewed several related articles and submissions were made on children's rights, including proposed wordings from Sinn Féin and others.  The Government majority on the committee opposed the idea of a comprehensive amendment on children's rights.  Instead of the committee proceeding with the proposal and seeking the advice of constitutional lawyers available to the committee, the matter was shelved.  Now the Government is apparently resurrecting the idea of an amendment on children's rights but in a most confusing way.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Sinn Féin argued in its submission to the all-party committee that the balance between the rights of the family as a unit and the rights of individual members favours the family disproportionately, in a manner potentially in conflict with the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the implications of this for the rights of children, particularly in respect of child protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The minimal wording proposed by the majority on the all-party committee does not adequately address this issue while Article 41.1.1 of the Constitution states that the family is "the natural primary and fundamental group of Society, and as moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law".  It lacks a specific comprehensive article on the rights of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The constitutional issues remain to be fully teased out but the Bill before us today deals on a more practical level with the rights and needs of children in foster care or in the care of their relatives.  More than 4,200 children are fostered in the 26 counties.  Over 1,500 of these have been in care for five years or more, though not all may have been in the same placement throughout the five year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Bill's stated aim to is give long-term foster parents and relatives more autonomy on issues such as consent to medical examinations and treatment and applying for passports, as well as needs that arise regularly, such as giving permission for children and young people to participate in school tours or other such educational, sporting or leisure activities, where adult permission is required.  This would remove inconvenience and embarrassment for foster children who face delays and obstructions in joining the normal activities that their friends and fellow pupils take for granted.  Anything which removes forms of differentiation, or even stigma, for children in foster care is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">In practice, this is probably a grey area of the law and I presume that many relatives who care for children, due to the inability of a parent or parents to do so, fulfil these functions without having their status checked by schools for the purposes of such permissions.  Obviously, foster parents would be conscious of all their legal obligations but I doubt very much if this is the case with relatives.  This matter needs to be addressed, without unduly burdening relatives caring for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">There is a distinction to be made in cases where informal arrangements exist between parents and other relatives to care for children without reference to the Health Service Executive, in which case I presume the provisions of this Bill do not apply.  As in all cases, the welfare and rights of the child need to be paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The Bill provides that a foster parent or a relative who has cared for a child for a continuous period of five years, the child having been placed with him or her by the Health Service Executive, may apply for a court order for increased autonomy in regard to the care of the child.  On Second Stage in the Seanad, Senator Henry questioned the five year stipulation.  I share her concern.  It seems a long period.  It is also a continuous period and does not take account of breaks that may occur in that period of foster care.  There is a need for more flexibility here and I ask the Minister to reconsider a shorter period, as well as some provision for breaks in the period of care.  For example, a child may return for a time to his or her natural parent or parents but may have to return to foster care.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">There may have been another amendment on one of the key points, the length of time.  While I welcome the Aire Stáit's clarification, I recommend that he reconsider the length of time.  Five years is a long time, one third of a child's growth years from infancy to young adulthood at 18 years, and may be too long in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The case of grandparents who look after their grandchildren has been highlighted previously here and we have called for more support for them.  In many cases, grandparents are looking after the children of their children, particularly in areas of Dublin city, but it is not confined to them.  Even in a rural constituency such as mine, I know of grandparents who are the primary carers because, sadly, their children have succumbed to the scourge of drug addiction.  They need every support in their work of care, including legal protection as well as financial and welfare support from all the relevant agencies.  I again appeal to the Government to give special attention to this special category of carers.  I echo what other speakers have said in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Tribute should be paid to the thousands of people who take children into foster care and give of themselves and their families to provide the love, attention and support all children need and deserve.  The Irish Foster Care Association provides a network for foster parents and highlights their work.  I commend its endeavours.  While the vast majority of foster parents provide excellent care, as with all adults with power over children, there is always the danger of abuse.  We must ensure the systems are firmly in place to guarantee that no child would be placed in a dangerous situation.  However, as we know, abuse has happened and does happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I previously made representations to the Minister of State, which he may recall, regarding a case of alleged abuse brought to my attention.  This case highlights the need for attention to be paid to the plight of those who "may" have been subject to abuse while in foster care.  We have no idea how widespread this may have been, especially in times when such abuse was much more hidden than it is today, and given the large numbers of children who have been placed in foster care over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The Minister of State should explore setting up a scheme of redress for people who suffered abuse while in foster care.  The precedent has been set with the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  The care of these children was entrusted by the State to institutions and foster parents and the State must accept its responsibility.  The Minister of State might commence with an investigation of this issue and then initiate action as appropriate.  I look forward to hearing from him in that regard.  The first step would be to invite those who may be affected to come forward and to consult with them directly, as, for example, in the case which I recently highlighted to the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">In addressing the Bill I am struck by the need for the State to inform people of their rights, as children, parents, carers — including foster carers — under the Constitution and in terms of the whole range of family law.  Sadly, in most cases, people only become aware of their rights and obligations when a problem arises.  I urge the Minister to examine this need to inform people of their rights and to act accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I welcome the Bill and look forward to further legislation in the related area of adoption which we have highlighted at various opportunities on the Order of Business.  Overall, we need to develop a progressive framework of laws that fully vindicate the rights of children and of all those who care for them.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_405">Tá áthas orm deis a fháil cúpla focal a rá ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  Caithfidh go dtugann sé an-spreagadh don Aire a chloisint go bhfuil tacaíocht ag teacht ó gach cúinne den Teach don Bhille.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I am delighted to welcome the Child Care (Amendment) Bill.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the officials in his Department for the fine work they have done in crafting this important legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">This short legislation will bestow basic but fundamental rights on children and guardians in the many foster care relationships that exist.  I am pleased to note the Bill has the support of the Irish Foster Carers Association, whose members are tireless advocates for the foster service.  Undoubtedly, they are best placed to evaluate the implications of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">In acknowledgement of the valuable service these foster homes offer both the State and the children they welcome into their homes, it is appropriate we take the necessary action to make the commitment and responsibility that they embrace less onerous and afford them the status of any other primary carer of children, whether that be a parent or an institution, in the delivery of basic day-to-day routines for those children.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">While the legislation addresses practical issues with which any parent would be familiar, it is also significant in the parity of esteem it offers children in a foster care environment, which they may share with natural children of that household.  Every effort should be made to ensure children who have arrived into the foster care system, through vulnerable circumstances beyond their control, should not be further stigmatised by onerous regulations that set them aside from their peers.  As any parent or child carer will attest, children are very sensitive to issues that differentiate them from their peers.  In this case, the simple tasks of securing permission for routine medical procedures or occasional visits abroad with school or family are constant reminders that highlight their difference.  While each incident on its own is probably a cause of minor discomfort, the cumulative effect of this reminder can only have a negative impact on the psychology of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">It is imperative that when circumstances arise that require the placement of a child in foster care, every effort would be made to cement the bonds within that foster care family.  It is fitting that the Bill would be passed in order to engender an environment that would enable the natural development of family bonds by removing unnecessary obstacles and distinctions.  The current position, I respectfully suggest, is also inconsiderate of the welfare and convenience of the many foster parents who do this State such a wonderful service by providing a loving and supportive environment for vulnerable children.  I am struck by the number of such foster parents who do so, not just on an occasional basis but who have done this work for many years.  Sometimes individual children are cared for on a short-term basis but in other cases the period of care is long term.  I recently met a lady in my constituency who is in her early 60s and is still providing foster care.  She has cared for no less than 15 children during her married life and in so doing she has made an enormous contribution to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">At a time when the privilege of adopting a child has become a relatively rare phenomenon, the increased rights that this Act bestows on foster parents could result in those who might seek adoption considering fostering as a practical alternative in realising their dream to raise children.  As a parent, I can honestly say that rearing children is not always the idyll presented in a Norman Rockwell scene, but can at times be challenging and difficult.  It is, nonetheless, life affirming to witness and guide young people in fulfilling their potential.  I hope the work of this House in this regard will result in many more families being encouraged to undertake this responsible but rewarding role.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">While approximately 5,000 children are officially fostered in Ireland, it is generally acknowledged that many more children are being cared for by family members other than their parents, most often by grandparents.  A number of speakers have alluded to this.  Deputy Lynch suggested that perhaps a legislative framework could be established to enshrine the connectivity between grandparents and grandchildren.  Despite the undoubted skill of the Minister of State, I am unsure as to whether it would be possible to design such legislation.  Nonetheless, it is important to state that the relationship that exists between grandparents and grandchildren are genuinely life enhancing.  These unofficial guardians and carers have heretofore been discouraged from seeking official recognition of their role by bureaucratic procedures such as those being removed as part of this timely legislation and, as such, have found themselves deprived of the significant financial aid afforded to recognised foster carers.  It is my hope that these informal family arrangements will now be recognised and supported routinely in a manner similar to those offered to registered foster carers.  In so doing we would improve the financial circumstances of carers and the children they cherish.  It is also worth noting that this Bill should have the very practical effect of relieving qualified social workers in the HSE of the time consuming and tedious duties of processing requests for minor medical procedures and travel arrangements which, in turn, will see their expertise better applied to the more serious child welfare cases that require ongoing attention.  All of us in this House are aware, from the work we do in our constituencies, of the need to have considerable resources applied to supporting vulnerable families in communities so that we can, as much as possible, avoid situations in which children have to be placed in foster care.  Members will agree on the need to continue to target resources in that direction.  In my 20 years working as a public representative I have observed the tendency to over complicate and regulate, simple practices and, procedures.  I am heartened that today the Minister is rectifying an example of this tendency.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I hope this Bill is a precursor to others that will address related issues such as the rights of foster children to choose official adoption into their foster family at age of consent.  In the debate in the Seanad the right of these children to family inheritance under the same favourable tax provisions that apply in respect of the natural children of a family was raised.  I add my voice to the call made in the Seanad.  It is something the Minister might address in his response or in future legislative proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Our 21st century society presents us with many complex issues, particularly around the definition of family.  With the passage of time and the increasingly multiracial nature of our society we have a broader and more open definition of what constitutes a family.  In the course of the passage of this Bill through Seanad Éireann a number of Senators mentioned the current position of unmarried fathers <i>vis-à-vis</i> their offspring.  This topic also arose on a number of occasions in this House today.  The Government has made strong efforts in pursuing biological fathers for the financial support of their children.  While this action has yielded considerable results it is also symbolic of the responsibility the State expects parents to take for their children.  In the interests of fairness it is only right that we should recognise the rights of unmarried fathers, rights similar to those we confer upon fathers within the legal state of marriage.  We are now a country of multicultural influences where there are many definitions of family.  We as legislators have a duty to accommodate this dynamic by framing responsible and just laws that confer rights on the relevant stakeholders within these families, while at all times using the primary welfare of the child as a compass for this decision making.  I look forward to seeing the Minister bringing forward other pioneering and relevant legislation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I welcome this Bill for the commonsense approach it offers to the daily occurrences of family life for those in foster care but, more importantly, for its significance in acknowledging the primary rights of the child and the important status the State must give to those who give of themselves as foster care providers.  I again compliment the Minister on the sterling work he has done in taking on the new and challenging role as Minister for Children.  The public have great confidence in him.  Members of the House have today signalled their confidence in him.  I look forward to the debate he has instigated on the rights of the child.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_416">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  Everybody in this House has dealt with individual cases in their constituencies as a result of which they got immediate inspiration as to what changes are needed in the law.  Sometimes such changes work and sometimes they do not.  One of our colleagues recently mentioned the rights and entitlements of children and parents.  Protecting both involves a very critical balancing act and must be carefully addressed as we proceed into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The purpose of the Bill is to provide that a foster parent or relative who has had a child in their care for a continuous period of five years, the child having been placed with them by the Health Service Executive, may apply to the court for increased autonomy in relation to the care of the child.  That is fine on the surface.  However, problems will arise.  People will resort to the courts on a more regular basis to pursue their rights or what they perceive as their rights.  The focus may not necessarily be on the rights of the child in the first instance but on the perceived rights of the parent or foster parent.  Such cases will require the judgment of Solomon because, in my dealings with the public, I sometimes find it extremely difficult to come down on one side or the other and be certain I have taken the right side.  It could be that for one reason or another one of the parties has tried to exclude the other and an argument has ensued as to whether that party has established the necessary bona fides to proceed.  The party in question may prove his or her case, but when the case is examined, taking into account what the child wants or what might be in the best interests of the child, questions might arise as to whether the course of action taken was the right one.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">A question arises as to when is a child not a child.  The issue of the age of consent, the age of reason and so on arises.  Like everybody else in this House, I have dealt with cases involving wayward children.  All children are entitled to be wayward.  I am talking about children who resent parental authority and decide to absent themselves from school and from home.  In what way will the law now protect the parent?  Will it ignore what may happen in the context of the child's future prospects?  If, for example, a 15 or 16-year-old boy or girl is encouraged away from home for a continuous period in the company of an adult of the opposite sex, does the law support the return to parental authority of that child?  As the law stands, the answer is "No" unless the parents have the wherewithal to contest a case in the courts.  Nothing happens automatically.  The case must go to court and the outcome depends on the weights and balances of the law, as the Minister of State, who is the expert in that area, knows.  I do not blame the Minister of State.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_198" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_420">The Minister of State's expertise in that area is well known.  In such situations, parents approach public representatives because, as legislators, they would be expected to be able to inform parents.  Public representatives can approach the Health Education Bureau, the Garda Síochána or the health services.  The response of the health services is usually that the matter is confidential and they cannot talk to public representatives, which is crazy.  The Garda Síochána tries to be helpful, although one might have to go back again and again.  The Health Education Bureau is so understaffed that it would have to drop half its workload to devote attention to the issue.  I am talking only about cases with which I have dealt and continue to deal.  I presume this kind of situation is widespread throughout the country.  In dealing with the legislation before us we must have due regard for what the rights of the child mean and also the long-term interest of the child.  Whatever other influence may fall over the child regardless of his or her age may have a bearing on his or her life as a child, teenager and adult.  From my initial examination of the Bill, we need to be careful.  I hope we do not run into an area that will cause contention in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">As a former member of a health board, like many Members of this House, I needed to get involved in individual cases on behalf of people wishing to adopt.  It can be heartbreaking for them if it does not work out.  If the adoption procedure is not adhered to in the letter and spirit, it will be a cause of great concern afterwards.  For example, if the adoptive parent is given the impression that all procedures have been complied with and it is now only a formality, we are into dangerous territory.  I am sure the Minister of State from his legal practice will give chapter and verse to substantiate that.  While we cannot anticipate every situation, we must lay down guidelines to ensure as far as possible the natural and adoptive parents do not come into conflict.  The only people who can do that are those who process and apply the regulations on adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">It is difficult to be judgmental in such cases.  However, one must recognise that we must think about the child's future and how he or she might want to know who his or her natural parents were and why he or she was adopted.  Equally if a bond has been established with the adoptive parents the question can be asked of the bond that has developed.  The area is fraught with pitfalls and future difficulties may arise, notwithstanding the purpose of the Bill.  We have all come across confrontations between parents — married couples and partners — who for one reason or another find that the relationship has broken down and a battle for custody emerges.  As the Minister of State knows this area is fraught with difficulty and has become very expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">In countless cases children have been removed from the jurisdiction to the east and the west and ultimately have been the subject of long, drawn out legal battles.  I am not sure whether the rights of the child form part of the consideration.  It would appear that while a judgment might contain references to the rights of the child, I do not know whether the child knows at that stage what is happening.  I am not certain as to what should happen.  One side will try to prove that the other side is unfit as a parent or guardian and unfit to have custody of children.  A sad and sorry situation develops in such circumstances.  Ultimately it comes down to the law deciding.  The courts may decide rightly or wrongly — we have no way of knowing.  When the situation degenerates to that extent it is far better to sit down and work out an amicable resolution rather than go down the route of confrontation which ultimately will fall to be decided by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">In the definition of foster parent or guardian — I presume it will also apply to a guardian in the future — I wonder whether we are likely to see an exacerbation of confrontation between natural parents and foster parents or guardians.  The Minister of State might dwell on the matter in his reply.  While I do not wish to be critical of the health services, from my dealings with such situations the Garda responds as it is bound to do.  However, if public representatives inquire on behalf of a person or persons into a situation of this nature, which we are entitled to do, there is a resentment that we are inquiring into a matter about which we are not qualified to talk.  That impression is regularly created and is unacceptable.  A public representative has duties, including statutory duties, one of which is to bring to the attention of the authorities issues which may be of concern to them and which in their opinion might lead to one or other party being at risk.  It is the duty of a public representative to relay that information to the relevant authorities.  It is the duty of the relevant authority to take whatever action needs to be taken within the law.  It is not its duty to tell the public representative to push off, that it is a private matter and that it and nobody else is qualified to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Such action would be beneficial to everybody, children and parents, including parents who do their best and may not be able to achieve their best.  It is the duty of the relevant section in the Health Service Executive to respond.  At times it may be difficult to explain the situation.  If a public allegation is made it may be difficult — the public representative will obviously try not to do so in order not to create difficulties for families concerned.  We have had cases of serious doubt as to whether the welfare of children was being adequately catered for — I do not intend going into them now.  During my time in this House I have seen such situations.  I have seen cases to which attention was drawn and they were being monitored.  In most such cases everything went fine.  However, whenever things went wrong in such cases, somebody always claimed that the law was inadequate and there was not sufficient law to deal with the situation.  That is not true — the law is always there to deal with that kind of or any similar situation.  It is necessary that people recognise that.  Whenever such a situation arises people always call for a change in the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">While this is not a political point, whenever we hear a request for a change in the law, I immediately look behind it to ascertain what happened and what should have happened and did not happen to protect the vulnerable child or adult.  I would like these matters to be capable of resolution without the necessity to enter the courts every five minutes.  In his reply the Minister of State may well say that if nothing else will resolve the problem, that is the natural order of things.  I would like to feel that everything was being catered for.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Previous speakers referred to children being in the charge of foster parents for continuous periods.  Will that be similar to some of the situations relating to the granting of naturalisation to people who are refugees?  A specific period is set out after which they will be considered.  Deducted from that, however, will be certain instances such as leaving the country for a period, for whatever purpose or reason, or having a particular difficulty, such as, for example, one of a financial nature.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether provision is being made in this regard.  If I had had more time to read the Bill this morning — unfortunately, I was otherwise engaged and could not devote more time to it — I would have more to say about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The new section 43A(3) provides that the conditions in respect of the notification or consent of the parent having custody or the person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> do not apply if the parent or person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> is missing or cannot be found by the Health Service Executive or the court so directs having regard to the child’s best interests.  Perhaps the Minister might elucidate further on that section in the context of what it will mean in practice.  Will it mean that the respective legal teams will have a great opportunity to array themselves on opposite sides and engage in a long battle?  Case law will build up over time and I presume that this will determine what will be the outcome.  However, case law can change the position and can create situations where the original intention behind legislation may become somewhat obscure and, as a result, further changes may be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">From my experience in the House, I am aware that attempts to legislate in respect of human relationships are fraught with difficulty.  Regardless of how one goes about it and no matter what law is passed, situations will develop that were not and could not have been anticipated.  If such situations were anticipated, by the time the case has been argued, it would be impossible to determine who was right and who was wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I hope the legislation will prove helpful.  I also hope that it will not be a stop-gap measure because I do not like such measures.  Any such measures that have been introduced in the House in the past have been found to be flawed and faulty and have usually necessitated the introduction of further primary legislation to replace them.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">I may be exercising a comprehensive right of reply in order to reassure the public that we are at our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I thank Deputies for the generous welcome that has been extended to this Bill.  It is a measure of the understanding Members have for those who undertake fostering and foster care.  The debate illustrated a deep understanding of the nature of the difficulties that people who engage in the fostering of children face.  Even Deputy Durkan was at his most philosophical in his consideration of the legislation.  I will deal in detail with the points he raised.  As an analysis of contemporary society and the role of litigation therein, his contribution was extremely interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I wish to begin by outlining the current position with regard to the numbers in foster care.  I provided some indicative figures earlier but I have since been provided with up-to-date statistics from the HSE performance monitoring report for the second quarter — April to June — of this year.  These figures have not been finally validated but it is worth placing them on the record of the House.  There are over 5,193 children and young persons in the care of the State and 88% of them, or 4,561, are in foster care placements.  Of the number in foster care placements, 3,130, or 68.6%, were placed with foster carers and a further 1,431, or 31.4%, were placed with relatives.  I will return to the issue of relatives because many Members alluded to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">A total of 50 children were in residential care and 106 were at home awaiting foster placements at the end of June 2006.  Some 101 new and approved foster parents were recruited in the first half of 2006 and 59 foster carers permanently left the service.  A total of 80.3% of approved foster carers had allocated named social workers.  The question of support for foster carers was raised in the debate and I will return to it later.  Approximately 88% of children in foster care have allocated named social workers.  Those are the up-to-date figures and they are worth reflecting upon in the context of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I wish to place on the record another set of figures compiled in respect of an analysis of our child care interim dataset for 2004.  The figures to which I refer illustrate the issues we are addressing in the legislation in a neat fashion.  There were 4,243 children in foster care in 2004 and, of these, 1,509 were in care for five years or more.  That is a substantial number.  A child who is in care for five years or more clearly has a bonded relationship with an entirely new family.  It is with this matter that the legislation is designed to deal.  I can provide more detailed figures in respect of the different periods but the figure of 1,509 is important.  Of those children to whom I refer, 1,118 were in general foster care.  A further 11 were in foster care but were children with very special requirements who needed additional supports, 379 were in relative foster care and one was in a pre-adoptive foster placement.  It is interesting that the child who was recently the subject of Supreme Court litigation was in a pre-adoptive foster placement.  The figures are worth reflecting upon in the context of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Deputy Twomey expressed a generous welcome to the Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I thank him for his comments.  The Deputy's experience as a general practitioner extends way beyond the treatment of patients.  As with most GPs, he is well aware of social workers and their practices and their merits and demerits.  He spoke very well on that matter and raised a number of interesting points.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Deputy Twomey inquired as to how I arrived at a decision that five years should be the relevant period for the purposes of the legislation.  This matter was also raised in the Upper House.  It is fair to say that the Deputy is anxious to see a reduction in that period to three or even two years because he feels that this would be in the best interests of the child and the foster parents.  There is a difficulty — we will probably discuss it on Committee Stage — in that there are often breaks in the continuity of foster care placement.  It is difficult to secure that element of continuity.  I appreciate the spirit in which Deputy Twomey raised this matter but there are difficulties in respect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I considered this matter carefully and I assure Deputy Durkan that the figure of five years was not plucked out of the sky.  The requirement in the Bill that a child be in the care of a foster parent or a relative for a continuous period of five years is appropriate because after five years have elapsed, foster parents or relative foster carers will be experienced and will have a sufficient level of understanding of the needs of the foster child.  If there are instances of instability or interruption in the placement, it is not appropriate for foster carers to have increased autonomy in respect of the child.  I accepted an amendment in the Seanad, which provided for a disregard of brief interruptions, which is important, but Members must understand that when an order is granted under the legislation in respect of a child, it means the State, through the HSE, will delegate its responsibilities for him or her to a foster carer.  All the rights and obligations of the State in respect of the child can be transferred to the foster parent but this cannot be done lightly.  The State must be satisfied there is an unblemished history of care on the part of the foster parent or relative.  I considered this issue at length and, on balance, five years is the correct period.  I have listened to the views of Members of both Houses and I will listen to the views of Deputies on Committee Stage.  Periods of two and three years have been proposed but I would not entertain such a period in the context of such a far reaching delegation.  I will reflect on the Second Stage debate and the upcoming debate on Committee Stage and I will take account of the views of national organisations but I am not disposed to depart from the period specified in the legislation, although I am open to further persuasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Deputy Twomey referred to the social services inspectorate and nursing homes.  The inspectorate has done a marvellous job inspecting children's facilities and many improvements have been made.  Reports are submitted to my office, which have raised questions about practices.  While, on occasion, the reports have been disregarded without their recommendations being implemented, a momentum for change and improvement and appropriate standards is built up over time through them.  The Deputy stated the HSE is not without imperfections and Deputy Durkan will concur with that view.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_442">I am not sure whether it is in order for a mere Minister of State at the Department to join in the chorus but it is essential the HSE implements its obligations under the legislation and I am confident it will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">One of the advantages of the legislation is that a great deal of unnecessary work will be obviated for social workers, permitting them to focus on more important work relating to children's issues.  It is ridiculous and foolish that a foster parent who has cared for a child for ten years must obtain a letter from a social worker to obtain a passport for the child.  That stigmatises him or her because if he or she is going on a school tour or a holiday, permission is required and the foster parent must have recourse to HSE social workers.  A more extreme example relates to medical treatment, which the foster parent will be permitted to make a decision on under this legislation.  On occasion, social workers have felt impelled to have recourse to the courts to permit a medical operation for a foster child.  Parents in a normal family do not have to go to court to approve an operation for one of their children.  I hope the legislation will obviate this need in regard to foster children and permit such decisions to be made by the foster parent.  This will save significant time for social workers and enable them to address many other matters than need attention and to support foster parents, when required.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Deputies Twomey and Durkan referred to the operation of the Children's Court.  Deputy Twomey was concerned that the judges of the court should have sufficient expertise and understanding of the needs of children in these cases.  My office has been engaged in discussions with the President of the District Court on this subject in recent months and I hope to bring forward proposals in this regard.  Anything related to the courts is fraught with constitutional difficulties but, on receipt of the appropriate advices from the Attorney General, I hope to take action in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Deputy Twomey also referred to child poverty.  The Government has taken 100,000 children out of the consistent poverty net, yet an unacceptable number remain in it.  The Deputy correctly stated the problem of child poverty in our affluent society increasingly relates to cultural rather than material factors, which must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">He also referred to the referendum on children's rights announced by the Taoiseach and questioned whether it would be possible to execute it in a few months.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness raised this issue in her report on the Kilkenny incest investigation more than a decade ago while an all-party committee examined the issue at length before publishing a report last spring.  I acknowledge the broad welcome extended by Deputy Kenny and Fine Gael for the proposal.  I have written to Deputy Kenny in this regard and I look forward to his response because this issue must be addressed.  I thank Deputy Twomey for his welcome for the legislation on behalf of the principal Opposition party.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Deputy Lynch took issue with Deputy Twomey regarding the five-year period.  She is satisfied this period is correct but her concern related to what happened to children in the past in Ireland.  Without singling out members of a church or a religious organisation, she stated everybody, including public representatives, teachers and parents, cannot have the attitude that there are untouchables in our society and we must be very careful when delegating responsibilities for children.  For those reasons, she was anxious to stand on the five-year period and she agreed with my judgment, for which I thank her.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">She also raised last week's Supreme Court decision in the adoption case and the fact that a request had been made after 11 months for the return of the child.  The decision illustrates a particular context in which we must examine constitutional change.  Much discussion has centred on where the principle of the best interests of the child should apply.  I agree with Mr. Justice Hardiman's judgment that, in general, the best place for a child is in his or her family and that is how his or her rights can best be vindicated.  However, the difficulty under the current constitutional arrangement is that when the family breaks down or the parents fail and the child enters the adoption or care system, it is not unequivocal in our constitutional order that those decisions must be taken in the best interest of the child.  Nobody can propose that a child should be taken into the care system in his or her best interest but, once a need to intervene is demonstrated, whether that is due to abuse, neglect or abandonment or whether the parents voluntarily relinquish their child into the care or adoption system, our Constitution does not provide plainly and unequivocally that subsequent decisions about the child should be made in his or her best interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Upon examination, the Supreme Court had a difficult decision to make.  Based on the facts, the Supreme Court's decision may have been in the best interests of the child, but there was a legal difficulty, namely, while the child had been placed in the adoption system, the subsequent marriage of the natural parents meant that the Supreme Court could not legally address the issue of what was in the child's best interests.  The Supreme Court needed to mechanically apply an inflexible rule of law that required the return of the child to the natural parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">That the Supreme Court did not address itself to the question of the child's best interests poses a difficulty.  In the case in question, it might be difficult to argue with the conclusion on the facts because the period after which the return of the child was sought was short, but if a child was voluntarily placed in foster care for a period of eight, nine or ten years and the natural parent sought his or her return, the best interests of the child would not determine his or her future under our current constitutional arrangement.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">We must reflect on this issue and be careful in our debate on the referendum.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that the rights and authority of parents under the Constitution must be safeguarded and respected.  This is not a matter of a block transfer of rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Several Deputies referred to difficulties that have arisen with social workers in other jurisdictions.  We must proceed with great care in this area because a balance must be struck.  The leaders of the other parties will discuss that balance with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I have addressed the question of the Supreme Court decision raised by Deputy Lynch.  She turned to the question of access rights and the importance of grandparents in that context.  Recent legislation has recognised the potential role of grandparents and I assure Deputy Lynch that section 37 of the Child Care Act 1991 respects that position and provides that, when a child is in the care of a health board, the board shall "facilitate reasonable access to the child by his parents, any person acting in <i>loco parentis</i>, or any other person who, in the opinion of the board, has a bona fide interest in the child”.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_456">I will revert to that matter.  Section 37 of the Act is the primary legislation governing this amending Bill.  The position of the grandparent is safeguarded — I will confine myself to that narrow point at this stage — under section 37.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Deputy Lynch turned to the question of the constitutional amendment and raised the issue of the best interests of children.  When children are taken into care or are in the adoption process, decisions made about them should be made in their best interests, but to extend that principle to other areas will require considerable elucidation and discussion.  The Deputy referred to the need for specialised sittings for family law matters, an issue on which I touched when I indicated the importance of a fresh examination of how the courts approach the question of children.  I thank the Deputy for welcoming the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Deputy Gormley welcomed the Bill and raised the question of the sense of belonging between a foster child and a foster parent.  I agree that this sense is important, but, as Deputy Durkan pointed out, it is possible for two different sets of individuals to have this sense of belonging.  The best interests of the child must come into play in this respect.  Regarding the discussion on children in the adoption and care processes, particularly vulnerable children, people should realise that children must have rights and cannot be objects or commodities for others.  In some of the more lurid debates, sight of this aspect can be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Deputy asked when the Hague Convention will be transposed into legislation.  The drafting of the legislation is at a final stage and I hope to publish it early next year.  He also referred to the signalling of my intention to incorporate on Committee Stage further amendments in respect of the Ferns Report.  He wanted further information on what is envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The Ferns Report made a number of recommendations concerning legal changes.  One recommendation was to create an offence of reckless endangerment where a person wilfully fails to have regard to the risks to which a child is exposed and to attempt to address in criminal legislation the problem of a failure to report, namely, the issue of mandatory reporting.  The offence in question has been legislated for in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The report raised a doubt about the powers of the Health Service Executive to investigate a third party abuse of children.  I sought the opinion of the Attorney General, who reassured me that there were no difficulties in that regard.  Nevertheless, the report recommended an in-depth study of the matter, which we have practically completed.  If necessary, we will clarify those powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The report also recommended that some form of injunction or restraining order should be available and that it should be possible to apply for such an order against a person who poses a grave risk to children and has unsupervised access to them.  Under current child care legislation, the HSE can supervise children or remove them from persons who have care or custody of them, but it will have no power to seek restraining orders against third parties under this Bill.  Empowering the HSE in this regard would not be done without difficulty and the report requested that we consider this issue.  The HSE cannot be transformed into some type of police authority — a balance must be struck.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Organisations with employees or volunteers who have substantial dealings with children must address their own responsibilities.  While the HSE has such responsibilities in regard to its large number of employees, to task it with dealing with the responsibilities of other organisations raises significant questions.  However, I am prepared to address the matter and determine whether a formula can be devised to examine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Another of the report's recommendations was the establishment of interagency groups to pool information between the HSE, local diocesan authorities and the Garda Síochána.  Everyone co-operated in the Ferns context, but the sharing of information of that character poses substantial legal difficulties in terms of freedom of information and data protection legislation and civil law relating to the protection of the reputations of individuals.  Legal protection must be provided to persons who engage in information-sharing exercises of this type.  If we are to legislate in this regard, the legislation cannot address a particular denomination or religious denominations in general.  It must extend to the convening of such information-sharing exercises in a wide variety of contexts.  This and other matters stemming from the Ferns Report are under examination and I thank Deputy Gormley for his request for information.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Deputy Catherine Murphy welcomed the legislation and was concerned by the assumption that adults always act in the interests of child.  This was not always the case and the State did not always act in the interests of children.  I agree with the Deputy that support networks are necessary, for which reason the legislation is important.  For many years, it has been requested and advocated by the Irish Foster Care Association and it will free up time spent on social work.  Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the position of grandparents and that is addressed in section 37 of the primary legislation.  She also said it was important to effect constitutional change to put children on an equal footing and I welcome her support in that connection.  She also asked wider questions, as did Deputy Durkan, about recognition for mothers and fathers.  If, in this referendum, we can confine ourselves to how we can, as far as is practicable, secure the best interests of children we will have achieved something.  If we enter the realm of the wide variety of other relationships which we all know exist in modern Ireland we will embark on a very difficult task.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Deputy Catherine Murphy concluded by questioning whether there was a legal and cultural difficulty relating to fostering in general, and whether a certain mindset existed in that regard.  In some ways she reminded me of the episode in the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta about baby farming, in somehow suggesting that fostering was not valued highly enough.  In recent years the State has gone a long way towards valuing fostering, not just in the material sense but in the legal sense by means of legislation such as this.  We are very anxious to promote fostering in every possible way.  It is important that people consider the option of fostering and those who undertake it do not do so on exclusively financial grounds but make a substantial altruistic commitment, which is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Deputy Ó Caoláin was concerned about the proposed constitutional referendum and undertook to discuss the matter with me, in which I am happy to oblige.  He was also concerned about the five-year period, which he thought too long.  As I explained to the House, a careful balance must be struck between the rights of parents and the State, the child and the foster parents.  The State has taken the children in question into care.  If a child is surrendered into care the parents can always revoke their decision but where the State has obtained an order in the District Court and taken a child into care that child is then in the direct care of the State.  We propose to delegate potentially all our responsibilities towards that child to another person and must proceed with great caution, which the five-year term reflects.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Deputy Ó Caoláin also raised the question of informal arrangements.  All in this House are aware of a grandparent, uncle, aunt or other relative who minds a child because the child has lost his or her parents or because the parents are unwilling or lack the capacity to look after him or her.  It is a common phenomenon but the position of the Department of Health and Children is that the State only intervenes when the child needs care and protection.  If the informal arrangement is working the State does not intervene.  There may be issues about income support but they are a matter for the social welfare system in terms of the amounts of money transferred to the persons caring for the children and the adequacy of the supports they receive.  Legitimate questions can be raised in that issue but, as far as the care and protection system is concerned, we intervene only when necessary.  Care and protection can be provided within or outside a marriage, in a formal or informal relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">This legislation relates to children who are in care and protection.  It is desirable where possible that such children be fostered with relatives, although that is not always possible.  Nevertheless, we in this jurisdiction have a better record than most in managing to place children with relatives when they need foster care.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I join with Deputy Ó Fearghaíl in paying tribute to the Irish Foster Care Association because it does tremendous work in this area.  He touched on the merits of the legislation and said it was important to cement the bonds in a foster care family and enable the natural development of family bonds, on which I agree with him.  However, that is a reason for being very careful about the period of time we choose, which also touches on what Deputy Durkan said to the effect that prescribing too short a period can foment litigation.  Deputy Ó Fearghaíl also said it was important to help those who wanted to foster, on which I also agree with him.  He also raised the question of inheritance rights but this legislation has nothing to do with inheritance rights.  For inheritance rights to apply it is necessary to adopt a foster child.  As I explained on opening this debate, it is proposed under adoption legislation that a foster child who has reached the age of 18 and has lived for five years with foster parents can be adopted at that stage with the agreement of all the parties concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Deputy Durkan raised a number of points.  I hope that my reply so far will persuade him that this is not a stopgap measure and is an attempt to strike a balance in this area.  He rightly raised the danger of litigation, drawing on his own experience as a member of a health board to outline the disputes that can arise among a wide variety of persons about a particular child.  All I can do is reassure him that this legislation has been drawn up with great care.  The application cannot be made to the court without the sanction of the Health Service Executive so a unilateralist approach is not possible.  Once the application is taken to court, parties must be notified but we have written into the legislation the principle that the court must have regard to the best interests of the child in making its decision.  Beyond that I am not sure that, as legislators, we can go very far, but I wish to highlight those two safeguards which were introduced to address the entirely legitimate concerns Deputy Durkan has expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I hope this legislation can be progressive social legislation, which I believe it will be, and not a happy hunting ground for the legal profession.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">The welfare of the undocumented Irish in the United States is an issue of the highest priority for the Government.  I continue to raise our concerns in all my dealings with key figures in the US Administration and Legislature, including during a wide-ranging discussion which I had recently with the new US Ambassador.</p>
            <p eId="para_477">In the period since the mid-term elections, I have written to a number of senior US legislators to congratulate them on the outcome of the elections.  In doing so, I have taken the opportunity to emphasise again the Government's deep interest in the issue of the undocumented.  Our ambassador in Washington is also active in highlighting our concerns in his ongoing contacts with the incoming congressional leadership.  The consulates are also active on this issue at state level.</p>
            <p eId="para_478">I travelled to New York after the elections, where I discussed the prospects for immigration reform with a range of contacts there.  I met again with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR, an organisation that is most effective in promoting awareness within the US of the Irish dimension to the undocumented issue.  This was the third in a series of meetings that I have had with the ILIR since September and it provided a valuable opportunity to review the position following the elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">I look forward to a further intensification of the Government's efforts on behalf of the undocumented in the period ahead, in particular with key members of the incoming Congress.  Overall, my initial assessment is that the recent elections have given a boost to the prospects for reform, though the issue of comprehensive immigration reform remains difficult and divisive both in Congress and in the United States generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">In view of this, I greatly appreciate the firm commitment to a comprehensive and sympathetic solution that Senator Kennedy, Senator McCain and others continue to promote.  Although the existing legislative proposals will lapse with the outgoing Congress, we can anticipate renewed examination of this important issue in 2007.  In particular, I welcome the intention of Senators Kennedy and McCain to bring forward proposals in the incoming Congress that will reflect the approach they have long promoted.  The recent reiteration by President Bush of his commitment to comprehensive reform is a further positive contribution to the debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_481">The Government's efforts on behalf of our undocumented citizens in the United States will continue to be accorded the highest priority in the critical period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_482">The outcome of the US mid-term elections has been heartening.  The indications from the Democrats that they are in favour of immigration reform show there is hope at last on this matter.  I am glad the Minister raised this issue at an early stage in the changeover of power.  With the Democrats now in the driving seat, does the Minister envisage real progress on this matter?  Does he expect the Democrat Party to give it top priority?</p>
            <p eId="para_483">Has the Minister ever broached the subject of a visa exchange programme between the US and Ireland, similar to the one that operates between the US and Chile and the US and Australia?  This would not only give Irish people access to the US labour market but would also give American citizens the opportunity to work here.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_211" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_484">Following the election there is undoubtedly a different landscape.  A number of the members of both the Democrat Party and the Republican Party who are favourably disposed to immigration reform have been re-elected, some with sizeable majorities.  A number of congressmen who were on the other side of the argument and promoted strict border controls suffered in the election.  There is a feeling, given the different political landscape, that there will be a better opportunity for reform in the coming months.  That is one of the reasons I travelled to the US, including New York recently.  I hoped to assess the situation, particularly from Niall O'Dowd and Grant Lally of the ILIR and a number of their officers.  I was also anxious to hear from other people who have been involved with this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_485">However, there are some members of the Democrat Party who would not necessarily favour immigration reform.  There are a number of reasons for this, not least the issue of labour supply and trade union issues.  These have a strong influence in the Democrat Party policy mix.  If we can conduct a little preparation work between now and Christmas, which is, in effect, the lame duck session, I hope we will be able to renew the lobbying campaign with some vigour.  We discussed how that could be promoted with the ILIR, as well as how that organisation envisages the next few months.  I am hopeful there will be substantial progress in that respect in the first half of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_486">With regard to bilateral arrangements, we are examining all the options.  However, our primary responsibility and priority is dealing with the undocumented issue once and for all and in a way that will be relatively easy for the people concerned.  There are a number of other suggestions regarding bilateral arrangements which might not necessarily assist the undocumented and might make matters even more difficult for them.  Our first priority, which is based on the advice we receive from people such as Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator John McCain, is a comprehensive reform package.  We will continue to lobby for that.</p>

            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_488">The crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan continues to be a matter of the gravest concern for the Government.  While there have been some limited signs of progress on the political front, the security and humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_489">On 16 November 2006 in Addis Ababa, the UN Secretary General and the chairperson of the Commission of the African Union co-chaired a meeting of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and of a number of African states, including Sudan.  The EU was represented by its special representative for Sudan.  The meeting considered three areas: the need to re-energise the peace process, the establishment of a strengthened ceasefire and the way forward for peacekeeping in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">It was agreed that the UN and the African Union should within 15 days organise a meeting between the signatories and the non-signatories of the May 2006 Darfur peace agreement, with a view to reaching agreement before the end of 2006 on the amendments to this peace agreement which would enable the non-signatories to adhere to it.  Former OAU Secretary General, Dr. Salim Salim, who chaired the Abuja peace negotiations, will lead this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_491">The meeting also called on all parties to the conflict in Darfur to commit immediately to a cessation of hostilities to facilitate the continuation of the political process.  The Government of Sudan was strongly urged to work with the non-signatories of the Darfur peace agreement on ceasefire related issues.  Due to the regional dimensions of the conflict, Chad and Sudan were urged to stop hostilities along their common border in Darfur and respect previous peace commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">Taking account of the UN Secretary General's proposals for a phased approach towards a strengthened peacekeeping operation in Darfur, the meeting agreed on the expansion of the UN's provision of personnel, aviation and logistical support to AMIS, the African Union's ceasefire monitoring mission in Darfur.  More significantly, agreement in principle was reached on the deployment of a hybrid AU-UN force in Darfur, capable of contributing to the restoration of security, the protection of civilians, ensuring full humanitarian access and implementing the security aspects of the Darfur peace agreement.  However, important issues remain to be resolved, including the size of the force and its command, control and reporting arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_493">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">I welcome these developments, especially the agreement in principle on a hybrid UN-AU force.  However, early acceptance by Sudan on the outstanding issues is essential.  Sudan is to give its considered response at the next meeting of the African Union's Peace and Security Council on 29 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">The UN and the AU are currently trying to reactivate the Darfur political process and are, in my view, best placed to do so, as distinct from an individual country initiative, however well intentioned.  Ireland strongly supports their efforts.  In pursuit of this, and given Egypt's major regional role and its significant weight in both the African Union and the Arab League, I wrote to the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17 November to urge his Government to bring every possible influence to bear on the Sudanese President to deliver on the Addis Ababa agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_496">I very much thank the Minister for his reply.  I welcome the fact we will have an opportunity to discuss a motion on Darfur early next week in plenary session.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">Is the Minister concerned that what is taking place in Darfur is a test of the United Nations commitment to the concept of humanitarian protection?  Put more bluntly, is it not an abuse of sovereignty to prevent the United Nations from intervening more appropriately?</p>
            <p eId="para_498">Is the Minister concerned at the figures given what is needed to resource the current mission?  The international response falls very much short of the $350 million in aid that was deemed necessary.  Also, there is a serious shortage in logistical capacity.  Frankly, there are more troops, police, aircraft and other transport required if the African Union is to make an impact.  This is at the core of the issue and it is with reluctance I say it, but my question mentions dispossession and violence against the person.  It seems that most of the criteria for defining genocide are met by what is happening in Sudan.  Perhaps the most important issue of all, which I should like the Minister to respond to, perhaps next week, is Sudan's reluctance to attend anything other than a Heads of State meeting.  Should there be a meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers, as I indicated at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which would serve as the first phase of the United Kingdom proposal for a Heads of State meeting dealing comprehensively with the region?</p>

            <p eId="para_501">On many occasions, particularly at GAERT meetings, I have said that in the context of the UN reform issue this is the first opportunity we have to put into practice the principle of responsibility to protect.  Ireland and a number of other countries such as Denmark have said at the start of the current phase of difficulties in Sudan that if the sanctions are not sufficient to put pressure on the Sudanese Government, we will have to move to plan B.  Plan B is the upward escalation of sanctions, but when to intervene is the key issue.  The fact is some progress has been made and it is not a simple matter.  Having visited Sudan in July, I know it is not a simple issue of just sending in a UN force.  I see that clearly, and when I left Sudan I believed strongly that the situation we have now arrived at would occur, namely, that there is agreement by the Sudanese Government to envisage a much larger UN hybrid mission than the present AMIS initiative.  I saw the AMIS mission in July and it was clear it was too small for Darfur, which is similar in size to France.  That is why Ireland and other EU countries contributed at a subsequent pledging meeting as regards beefing up the existing AMIS contingent.  It is a difficult situation in which, thankfully, Mr. Kofi Annan and the UN have been very actively involved in conjunction with the African Union.  I am somewhat hopeful this issue can move positively in the near future.</p>

         if, in view of the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld, the Government will reconsider its decision to allow the US military to use Shannon Airport; his views on whether the war in Iraq has destabilised the country and been counterproductive and that the coalition forces should set a deadline for withdrawal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_219" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_505">The Government has no plans to reconsider the long-standing policy of successive Governments to extend landing and overflight facilities to US military aircraft.  The policy was endorsed by the House, following an extensive debate, on 20 March 2003.  US military aircraft have been landing in and overflying Ireland for more than 50 years.  I recall the Taoiseach's statement to the Dáil on 20 March 2003, that "the withdrawal of such facilities at this time could not but be seen, by any objective observer, as a radical and far-reaching change in our foreign policy".</p>
            <p eId="para_506">The reality is that the international forces serving in Iraq are operating at the explicit request of the Iraqi Government and under UN mandate.  The presence of the multinational force was authorised initially by the UN Security Council under Resolution 1511 of October 2003, which urged member states to contribute assistance under the UN mandate.  That mandate has since been renewed twice.  All three of these resolutions were adopted unanimously by the Security Council, including Muslim and Arab states.  The current mandate expires at the end of December.  The Iraqi Government has asked the Security Council to further extend it, and this will be considered by the Council in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">The Government shares the widespread concern at the extremely difficult situation in Iraq.  Developments have been dominated by the continuing deterioration in the security situation, and in particular the terrible consequences of the spiralling cycle of sectarian violence.  There is currently no sign that the insurgency and the inter-communal violence across the country are being brought under control.  It is clear they are effectively blocking the political and reconstruction efforts of Iraq's first fully sovereign and democratic government and parliament.  The worst violence has been between Shia and Sunni groups in Baghdad and central Iraq, but there has also been an increase in violence in the south of the country.  The Kurdish area in the north has largely been unaffected by the violence, although there are dangerous signs of ethnic tensions in the disputed city of Kirkuk.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_509">As Deputies will be aware, there is a major policy debate under way regionally and internationally on how the terrible violence in Iraq can be ended and stability and prosperity established.  It is clear there are no easy solutions. The question of the withdrawal of international forces naturally arises as one option.  We look forward to the day when Iraq can provide for its own security needs.  I have no doubt this is also the firm objective of Iraq's political leaders, and indeed of the countries providing troops to the multinational force.  Until now the Iraqi Government has made it very clear that it believes it still needs this support, and that an early withdrawal could lead to a further deterioration in the political and security situation across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">There is an onus on the international community as a whole, whatever the differences over the invasion of Iraq in 2003, to work together to do what is possible to help provide a better future for the Iraqi people.  A secure and peaceful Iraq can be assured through the maintenance of its territorial integrity, the development of shared political and other institutions, and strong links with all the countries of the neighbouring region.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_511">The Minister started by trotting out the usual rubbish about this being long-standing policy.  It is not a long-standing policy.  I remind him that in the Horgan case, Mr. John Rogers, SC, made it very clear that between 1945 and 1991 successive Irish Governments imposed very strict limitations on the use of Irish territory, even in peacetime.  It allowed US troops transit on Irish territory only if they were unarmed, not engaged in war and not even engaged in military operations.  I remind the Minister that a document from the security policy section of his Department, dated 16 December 2002, revealed that what was occurring at Shannon was not, in fact, normal, but rather "entirely exceptional".  The text noted quite explicitly that on an exceptional basis a decision was taken to provide landing and refuelling facilities, pursuant to the State's obligation under a UN Security Council resolution.  That is what it says, so for the Minister to say this is normal practice is nonsense.  The fact is the Minister continues to kow-tow to George W. Bush.  He and others who have supported the war in Iraq have been proven completely wrong.  As I said in the question, the war has proven to be entirely counterproductive.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">The Minister mentioned various UN resolutions.  When he reads Resolution 1546, which refers to meeting the needs of the Iraqi people for security and stability, humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, will he agree that what exists is not stability?  I should like the Minister to look at the facts on the ground, where 100,000 Iraqis are leaving each month, where the US central command in a classified briefing paper in mid-October said the situation was close to chaos, which the CIA confirmed, and where successive opinion polls in Iraq show that the US troops should get out if there is to be stability.  Why does the Minister completely ignore all the facts and continue with a policy which the Irish people opposes?  Some 100,000 people came out on the streets of Dublin to say they did not want this war.</p>

            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_541">The Government is deeply concerned by the situation in the occupied territories, and especially by the toll of death and destruction in Gaza.  We have conveyed our position clearly and consistently in direct contacts with the relevant parties, including the Israeli Government.  We have been to the fore in the formulation of EU policy positions on the issues involved and have played a prominent role at UN level.  We will continue to do so actively.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">Deputies will be aware that I condemned unreservedly the killing of 18 civilians in the shelling of Beit Hanoun by the Israeli Defence Forces on 8 November.  I also condemned the killing of an Israeli woman in rocket attacks on Sderot on 15 November.  The Government has continued to call for an immediate end to all violence, including the Israeli military operation in Gaza and the firing of rockets on Israel from Palestinian territory.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">The General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 13 November strongly deplored the Israeli military action in Gaza and the unacceptable military operation in Beit Hanoun.  On 17 November, an emergency special session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution, which was introduced by the Palestinian delegation, calling on Israel to cease immediately military operations that endanger the Palestinian civilian population and to withdraw its forces from within the Gaza Strip to the positions they occupied prior to 28 June.  The resolution also calls on the Palestinian Authority to take immediate and sustained action to bring an end to violence, including the firing of rockets into Israeli territory.  Following intensive co-ordination within the EU, Ireland and all other EU member states voted in favour of the resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">The continuing violence and the serious humanitarian situation in Gaza underline the urgent need to revive a credible peace process in the Middle East.  We strongly support the efforts of President Abbas to negotiate the formation of a Palestinian national unity government with Hamas and the other Palestinian groupings, and our representative in Ramallah has conveyed this to him directly.  Given the context, it is not surprising that these negotiations have proved difficult and that agreement has not yet been reached.  In recent weeks there has been some evidence of differences of emphasis and approach in a number of statements by spokesmen for Hamas.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">I have stated on many occasions that if agreement can be reached on a Government committed to a two-state solution and based clearly on an end to violence, Ireland will argue strongly for a generous and creative political response from the EU and the international community.</p>
            <p eId="para_546">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">The EU has stated that a Government with a platform reflecting the Quartet principles and allowing for early engagement would be a partner for the international community in re-launching the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">The Government and our EU colleagues continue to impress on the Israeli Government the urgent need to end all practices in the occupied territories which threaten to undermine the viability of a two-state solution and which are in contravention of international law.  These include the continuing expansion of settlements, the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land and the practice of the demolition of Palestinian homes in east Jerusalem.  The EU also continues to make it clear that it will recognise no changes to the pre-1967 borders other than those negotiated between the parties as part of a final status agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">We should not give up hope.  While I accept that some of the utterances by Hamas on the two-state solution have been unhelpful, it must be acknowledged that it is the international community, and not just the European Union, that advocates such a solution.  The involvement of the Union has been upscaled recently and it is interesting to note that, over the past year, it has increased its aid allocation to Palestine by 30%.  There has been a 40% increase in the allocation of the Irish Government.  Although there has been a ramping up in aid, we fully accept the humanitarian situation in the region is dire.  However, a solution will only be reached if a viable Government is formed and that is one reason the European Union has been trying its level best to assist Hamas and President Abbas in putting together a national unity Government.  We believed we were close to doing so in recent days and weeks but, unfortunately, the process is taking somewhat longer.  Until the parties involved acknowledge the two-state solution as the only viable way in which the people can live side by side, the region will continue to be subject to flux.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">The European Union has launched a number of initiatives.  A recent one spearheaded by three countries, including Spain, contains a number of positive features we believe could be taken on board.  The French were involved to some extent.  However, the conflict ultimately must be dealt with in the context of the international community, under the guise of the Quartet, pushing the two-state solution.  It is a question of encouraging the people I hope will be going into government in Palestine to recognise what are regarded in this House as democratic norms, including adherence to non-violence.  They must recognise that Israel is a democratic country.  It is understandable that one may have difficulties with the attitude of the Israelis in view of what has happened but we must be conscious that it is not a one-sided issue.</p>

         if he is confident that the St. Andrews timetable will deliver functioning political institutions by March 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_560">The St. Andrews Agreement underpins the Good Friday Agreement, setting out a clear way forward for all parties to commit themselves to the full operation of stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and to full support for the policing board.  It sets out the practical changes proposed to the operation of the institutions.  It also sets out specific commitments in areas such as human rights and equality, arrangements for a financial package and a timetable for implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">Consistent with that schedule, the British Government has brought forward draft legislation to make the necessary provisions to allow devolved government to be restored in March 2007.  That legislation yesterday completed its passage through the Westminster Parliament.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">The legislation provides for a transitional assembly to meet from 24 November to allow the parties to prepare for restoration of the devolved institutions.  It includes amendments to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to implement, on restoration, the practical changes to the operation of the institutions agreed at St. Andrews.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">It also provides for the electoral endorsement of the St. Andrews Agreement by way of elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 7 March 2007.  The British Government has made clear, however, that an election will only take place if the parties are working constructively towards participation in a power-sharing executive by 26 March next year.  The legislation explicitly makes provision for the Northern Ireland Assembly to be dissolved at any time before 25 March 2007 if it is considered that there is no reasonable prospect of establishing a power-sharing government.  In those circumstances, the governments would move immediately to implement new British-Irish partnership arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">The St. Andrews timetable also envisages regular meetings of the new programme for government committee to enable the parties to agree priorities for the new executive.  I was encouraged that the committee met for the first time earlier this week and that it has now begun to address some of the most pressing practical issues that will face the restored executive.  We expect those preparations to intensify from tomorrow, once the transitional assembly gets down to business, and we will be working with the parties in the incoming executive over the coming months to assist them in their preparations.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_566">The Government firmly believes that the St. Andrews Agreement, implemented in good faith, will clear the way for the restoration of the devolved institutions of the Good Friday Agreement on 26 March next year.  The process will of course continue to require careful management over the coming weeks and months to bring it to a successful completion.  All parties will have to play their part in ensuring that the timetable is met.  For its part, the Government will continue to work in close partnership with the British Government, as well as with the parties, to secure our over-riding priority, the restoration of power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_567">Is the Minister aware that, we hope, between 10.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. tomorrow, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams will nominate Martin McGuinness as Deputy First Minister of the Six Counties Assembly?  Does he agree that it is important for the DUP to put forward its nominee, Ian Paisley, for the position of First Minister in line with proposals outlined at St. Andrews and that it is the minimum required by the peace process?  Does he also share Sinn Féin's hope that the DUP will come on board the Good Friday Agreement and play a full role in the shared future that it has with the rest of us on the island?  Is the Minister aware of the difficulties faced by republicans in sharing power with the DUP, given its violent, sectarian, paramilitary past and anti-republican, anti-Nationalist and anti-equality agenda for nearly four decades?  In the event that the DUP once again fails to sign up to share power with Nationalists and republicans on the basis of the agreement, will the two governments move ahead in implementing joint partnership arrangements thereunder?  Will he commit himself to standing by the Good Friday Agreement, making it clear that further stalling is unacceptable?</p>

            <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_568">There is greater need than ever for leadership on both sides regarding this issue, and we hope that we will see that tomorrow and in the coming weeks.  If we fall at any hurdle, we will move to the situation indicated, namely, plan B.  However, that is not the preferred option of either Government.  We want devolved government to be restored to Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">Leadership is required on the part of the DUP to show that it is quite prepared to share power with Nationalists under the arrangements laid down in the Good Friday Agreement.  Equally, movement is needed on the part of the Deputy's party on policing.  We have heard it stated time and time again that it is prepared to move on policing, and now we would like to see the colour of its money in that respect.  We would like to see Sinn Féin propose an Ard-Fheis to discuss the issue, one hopes moving positively towards acceptance of policing.  That sooner that it happens, the better.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">The two Governments have always believed, from the time of their move regarding the culmination of discussions in St. Andrews, that 24 November would be a significant date.  On the one hand, it would show clearly that the DUP is willing to sit in government with Nationalists on a power-sharing basis under the Good Friday Agreement.  Second, it would show that the Deputy's party was prepared to move on the policing issue.</p>

         the programmes funded by Irish Development Aid in Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Zambia; the progress of the various programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_260">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_572">The countries outlined by the Deputy are termed "programme countries" and are thus a particular focus for the Government's aid programme, Irish Aid.  The objectives of the aid programme in each programme country are poverty reduction and sustainable development.  We address fundamental human needs such as food security, basic education, primary health care and safe water supplies.  We also emphasise capacity-building and good governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">Ireland delivers its aid in those programme countries through a variety of channels including government systems, direct implementation, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the multilateral system, including UN agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">Irish Aid's total funding to Mozambique in 2006 will amount to approximately €40 million.  Irish Aid assists in the implementation of the national poverty reduction plan.  Aid is focused on sectors including health, education, agriculture, HIV-AIDS and good governance.  Irish Aid also works closely with the Clinton Foundation and the Government of Mozambique to deliver essential life-saving drugs to sufferers of AIDS.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">In Uganda, our aid programme funds the Ugandan Government's poverty eradication action plan, which is the key framework within which international donors deliver assistance.  Support is concentrated on the areas of governance, health, HIV-AIDS and education.  In 2006, support of €4 million has been provided to Irish NGOs such as Concern, GOAL and Trócaire.  Funding is also provided to the United Nations World Food Programme, WFP, and Oxfam for emergency operations in northern Uganda.  Overall, assistance to Uganda will amount to approximately €36 million in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">Ireland's aid to Ethiopia in 2006 will amount to approximately €35 million.  The aid is spent primarily on addressing the needs of the rural poor, for example, by supporting the provision of basic health care at village level, combating the spread of HIV-AIDS, funding teacher-training and strengthening the public service.  The social safety nets programme, funded and originated by Ireland, is a UN-monitored fund that provides the poorest Ethiopians with cash or food in exchange for labour.  It is keeping approximately 7 million Ethiopians from falling into dire poverty and starvation.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">Tanzania's national poverty reduction strategy provides the framework for Ireland's support to the country.  The Irish Aid programme of approximately €27 million in 2006 provides support regarding education, health, HIV-AIDS, agriculture and governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">Approximately €20 million was allocated for Ireland's aid to Zambia in 2006.  The focus of the programme is on basic needs and poverty reduction through support for health, education, water and sanitation, and governance, with particular emphasis on HIV-AIDS.  Ireland also works in Zambia's Northern Province meeting the basic water needs of thousands of families in remote areas.  In 2006, Irish funding has enabled the provision of safe drinking water and improved sanitation to over 80,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">Irish Aid is having a definite, positive and sustained impact in the areas where we work.  In Mozambique, with Irish Aid assistance, from 2004 to 2005, 83 clinics were built and over 250,000 people received HIV testing and counselling services.  With Ireland's support, immunisation rates against childhood diseases in Uganda now stand at 84% for the entire country.  Ireland's support to the very poor Tigray region of Ethiopia in 2006 led to the construction of over 500 wells, 100 water points and 145 primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">A detailed account of all Irish Aid's programmes, projects and results, as well as an analysis of funding, is available in the annual reports, which are placed in the Oireachtas Library.</p>

            <p eId="para_582">While there has been a very welcome increase in the allocation for this year, in view of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which uncovered 243 reports of category A findings, that is, weaknesses in accounting procedures and ways in which funds were spent, what steps is the Department taking to address the issues raised?  Since Irish Aid is undergoing decentralisation and involved in disputes, and the Department lacks enough staff to administer the increased aid, what steps is the Minister taking to address the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the problems in Irish Aid, and the staffing of his Department?</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_585">I would like to answer the very pertinent questions posed by the Deputy.  My Department welcomes the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is the first time in the 30-year history of the Irish Aid programme that the Comptroller and Auditor General has seen fit to investigate how this funding is spent.  In response to his report, I made immediate representations, along with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, for additional staff to cover our day-to-day needs in terms of audit, evaluation and monitoring of the dispersal of moneys under the aid programme.  We were given an immediate positive response from the Minister in the form of 20 additional staff, 14 of whom have already been hired and are now deployed in the task of monitoring and evaluating the spending programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">The programme is heavily audited.  We are one of the few Departments with an internal audit committee composed entirely of external nominees rather than departmental officials.  It is something of which we are proud.  It is the most robust and independent internal audit committee in the entire Civil Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">We are satisfied with the progress made to date on decentralisation.  Some 69% of our staff complement have already indicated their wish to move to Limerick.  We will send an advance party there in May to help the transition.  The senior management team is mostly in place and will be fully in place before Christmas.  I will not underestimate the challenges we face in regard to decentralisation.  There are ongoing problems in respect of the professional technical grades, that is, the development specialists.  Few of the more senior specialists have opted to go to Limerick because of a well publicised legal issue.  That issue is before the courts in Europe.  I assure Deputies that at the most senior level within my Department and in the Department of Finance, we are at an advanced point of negotiation to clear up this particular imbroglio, which must be resolved before staff can be fully transferred to Limerick.</p>

            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_588">The Minister of State used the term "good governance" in his reply.  Is this a reference to the Wolfowitz definition through the World Bank, that is, an imposed accountability for micro-economic plans, or is he talking about good governance as it might relate to the social, economic and historical realities of the countries about which he has spoken?  Is his Department open to holding a public seminar on the meaning of the concept of good governance so that it is no longer interpreted, as it already is by many receiving countries, as a further imposition?</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_589">I entirely agree with the spirit of the question posed by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  For Irish Aid, the definition of governance is far wider than the one he suggests is applied by the World Bank.  The latter is bound to use such a definition because it is an economic institution.</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_591">As an agency that disperses development co-operation funding, we take a much different approach.  It is a broad definition which encompasses the human capacity of the countries in which we operate to manage themselves, in particular their public finances and the means of developing their expertise at managing those finances.  We spend some €70 million each year on governance measures across our various programme countries.  Much of this spend is concentrated on enhancing the capability and capacity of the countries to manage themselves, by empowering them to impose sophisticated systems for the audit, monitoring and evaluation of their own public spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">In many of these countries, unfortunately, because the record-keeping is in a poor state, it is often extremely difficult to evaluate retrospectively how our money was spent and whether value for money was achieved.  It is a significant issue and we have been attempting to tackle it for some time.  Many years ago in Lesotho, for instance, we funded an accountancy training college because that country had no accountants in its public service at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_593">Does the Minister of State's definition of good governance include indigenous decision-making systems such as village systems?  I am more interested in that than in accounting systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_594">In some of our programme countries, traditional and indigenous systems of leadership are in place which are important in terms of influencing people, whether in regard to AIDS prevention, democratic government or other issues.

Will he renew the funding for this organisation?</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_598">The Department is extremely satisfied with the nature and focus of the programmes and projects run by Self Help in Africa.  As I publicly stated myself and through my officials, however, we are dissatisfied with the internal warring feud that is ongoing for almost a year within its board in Ireland and between the chief executive officer and certain members of the board.  This is not something that is happening behind closed doors; it has been reported in the newspapers.  This causes Irish Aid to pause and be careful.  I am frequently told in this House that we must have effective systems of evaluation and monitoring so that we can be sure the money we dispense is spent effectively.  That is our primary concern.  Anybody who would ignore such a situation in a charity predominantly funded by Irish taxpayers through Irish Aid would be accused of negligence.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">Self Help was included in our first three-year multiannual programme scheme, MAPS 1.  The development of the second multiannual programme scheme, MAPS 2, is nearing completion but no organisations have yet qualified and been accepted for it.  Several are currently seeking to meet the criteria to graduate to MAPS 2.  This is a five-year multiannual programme in keeping with the Green Paper's commitment to extend more predictability to our partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">I have written to the board and chief executive officer of Self Help to indicate that we cannot continue discussions in regard to its application to be part of MAPS 2 while this particular situation is ongoing.  Our concerns relate to the corporate governance of Self Help in Ireland rather than to its work in Africa, where its programmes are well run and well evaluated.</p>

However, my officials were contacted by representatives of the IFA who expressed their concern about the situation in Self Help.  My officials were mindful of the fact that the basis for Self Help's funding is essentially founded on the support of the IFA throughout the State.  It is a charity that is rooted in rural areas,</p>

            <p eId="para_617">To date, the emphasis has been on primary education and giving those in the programme countries an opportunity to attend school.  The results so far have been good, particularly in Uganda.  Moneys are mainly spent on schools and teacher training.  A pressing issue in some of the programme countries, which have done well in primary education enrolment, is secondary school provision.  For example, when I visited Lesotho with President McAleese, its Minister for Education pointed out funding needs were becoming acute at second level.  As free primary education had been extended to all children, they were incurring more financial pressure as children moved on to second level education.  We are opening up funding for second level education provision.  Our prime purpose, however, will remain with primary education.</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_621">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 31 and 36 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">The Government has provided a total allocation of €728 million in Vote 29, international co-operation, for 2007.  A further €85 million will be allocated to overseas development through other Departments, bringing the total allocation in 2007 to €813 million.  This represents an increase of €128 million on the 2006 level of funding in Vote 29.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">This allocation, the highest in the history of the programme, will meet the Government's interim target of spending 0.5% of GNP on overseas development aid.  It emphasises our commitment to the developing world and ensures Ireland will continue to be one of the most generous donors on a <i>per capita</i> basis when compared to its EU partners and other OECD countries.  It also demonstrates that Ireland is well on track to fulfilling our commitment to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012.  The increased funding will enable us to deliver on the commitments contained in the recently published White Paper on Irish Aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Various areas will be scaled up.  The emergency and humanitarian assistance budget line will be increased by 50% from €60 million to €90 million.  This will substantially enhance our level of response to worldwide humanitarian emergencies.  Investment will continue in the rapid response initiative, which will provide a uniquely Irish contribution to enhancing the international humanitarian system in 2007.  In line with the overall increase in the Vote, significant increases are planned in the allocation to Irish and international NGOs, expected to be over €100 million in 2007.  These increases reflect the importance we attach to the work of our partner NGOs and the way their work complements the Irish Aid programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">One key priority for 2007 will be to increase and enhance public information activities and to strengthen public ownership and awareness of the work of Irish Aid.  In 2007, an information centre will be established in Dublin city, where members of the public can access information available on volunteering opportunities and development issues more generally.  This shopfront will also showcase the Government's overseas aid programme and engage in other public information activities for the aid programme.  The Government will continue its support for combating HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases in the developing world, with plans to spend at least €100 million next year.  This is in line with the commitment the Taoiseach gave in New York when the new timeframe of 2012 was set.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">The Estimates show significant increases are planned in contributions to the UN and other development agencies.  Over the next several weeks, I will hold a series of bilateral meetings with the heads of agencies in New York before a final decision is taken on those 2007 funding allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">I welcome the support which the House has given to the increased aid funding.  I look forward to the co-operation of Deputies as the aid programme expands.</p>

            <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_628">I welcome the increase in the overseas development aid in the Estimates.  However, it is a case of better late than never.  As the Minister of State stated, the Government originally promised to achieve the 0.7% target by 2007.  Is the Minister of State aware that the logic is that the larger the amount in the kitty, the larger the grant.  One cannot jump from percentages to figures as it only confuses the issue.  Obviously, if the Government had achieved the 0.7% figure, the monetary size of the grants would be much larger.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">Will the increase of 0.04% per annum, required for the next five years to reach the 0.7% target, be achieved?  Will the Minister of State introduce legislation to safeguard that commitment?  We do not know who will be the Minister with responsibility in this area after the next election.  He or she could renege on that commitment, which was made on behalf of the people.  Will the Minister ensure there is not another U-turn on this matter?</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_630">I will try my level best to maintain this area of responsibility.  There is cross-party support that we should achieve the 0.7% target by 2012.  While other parties may have liked to see it reached earlier, when I took this job, I decided the target time had to be reframed because it was not realistic.  Legislating for it has been raised by several Deputies but I am not sure whether it would be helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">The Department of Finance is tracking percentages and not looking at increases in cash or volume of aid.  According to GNP as it stands at the start of the Estimates process, the Department allocates the percentage amount that meets the requirement to reach the 0.7% target.  In New York, when the new timeframe of 2012 was set, two benchmark figures were set down that we would have to reach if we were to prove our sincerity in meeting the final target.  These are milestone dates — to achieve 0.5% by 2007 and 0.6% by 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_633">We are well in position to achieve these milestones.  Next year, we will have reached 0.5% of GNP.  Members berated me when I first took up this area of responsibility, claiming we needed to be credible on achieving the target.  I stated, even prior to the setting of the 2012 target date, that we needed to be on 0.5% in the next two years to prove we could make the jump to 0.7%.  The next Government will be in a good position to see this through to the final target of 0.7%.  I am proud the Department of Finance has agreed to a historic seven-year multi-annual agreement in funding to be made available to Irish Aid.  That is the kind of predictability we need to expand this ambitious programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">I wish we could switch the Minister of State on and off to keep him to some time limits so we can get a word in edgeways.  I reassure the Minister of State that we did not berate him but his Taoiseach who made the promise in the United Nations in 2000 that he would reach 0.7% in 2007, which has resulted in the hungry and needy having to wait a further five years.  I agree we should enshrine this in legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">The missionaries, lay and religious, sacrificed a great deal many years ago to work in these countries but now that they have returned their existence depends on charity.  Has the Minister of State turned his attention to the wishes of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which met representatives of those missionaries?  Has he addressed the issue of providing some remuneration for those people in their latter days?</p>

            <p eId="para_637">I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy but Irish Aid already funds the Irish Missionary Resource Service, IMRS, to the tune of €14 million this year.  That funds 1,500 missionaries in the field.  Irish Aid officials are discussing this with the Department of Social and Family Affairs which carries primary responsibility for the provision of pensions and other social welfare entitlements.  The IMRS is also involved in these discussions.  With such a large allocation to the missionary services, distributed to approximately 80 distinct organisations, it should be possible for the three of us to achieve what the Deputy seeks.  My colleague Deputy Kitt has raised the same issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_639">With regard to the IFA it is a question of whether one feels bullied.  Many Ministers for Agriculture over the years might have claimed they were bullied by the IFA.</p>

            <p eId="para_641">If we on this side of the House have an issue with the IFA we stand up to it, as we do to Deputy Gormley.  We could not be bullied by it.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">There is a rather toxic quality to the relationship between the IFA and Self Help to the point where the IFA has withdrawn its support for that organisation.  That is a matter of profound regret and concern to me because it has implications for the underlying funding of Self Help which relies heavily on private contributions or subscriptions.  It worries me that such a well-known organisation with a countrywide network of contacts as a fundraising pool has withdrawn support from Self Help.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">Self Help is one of the smallest of the five MAPS participants.  We contribute €3 million, whereas we give GOAL €1.5 million a month and Concern between €19 million and €20 million a year.  Self Help is small but effective.  Its projects on the ground are of the highest quality and have stood up to inquiry, investigation and evaluation.</p>

            <p eId="para_644">Is the Minister of State concerned that the five strongest economies in the European Union are camouflaging their figures and are not likely to reach their 2015 targets?  They are doing this by including matters under the official development aid target that have nothing to do with development, such as education of refugees, providing information and so forth.  This statement has been made by the International Federation of Human Rights Organisations in Europe.  The Minister of State must be familiar with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_647">It is within the rules of the development assistance committee to include some costs for the resettlement of refugees as part of official development assistance.  We do not fully set these costs against our official development assistance as other donors do and have never decided to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">Multilateral debt relief qualifies for official development assistance but it drops out the following year according to the amounts and when they are given.  This year, thanks to the generosity of the Minister for Finance, we achieved 0.5% for the first time, one year ahead of the schedule we had pencilled in.  We achieved this because of a one-off €59 million payment by the Minister to the multilateral debt relief package begun in Gleneagles.  That will drop out next year but we will reach the 0.5% target in 2007.</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_660">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 38 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">The UN committee on economic, social and cultural rights has stated in its General Comment No. 15 that "the human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses".  The Government supports the views expressed by the committee in its General Comment No. 15.  Irish Aid is working to ensure that financial and other supports are provided to enable developing countries to devise and implement national strategies and action plans aimed at delivering water and sanitation to all their citizens, with priority to the poorest rural and slum dwellers.  These actions are being taken within the framework of the UN's international decade for action, Water for Life, 2005-2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">The purpose of the international decade for action is to promote efforts to reach the millennium development goal target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation, as well as the realisation of integrated water resource management and water efficiency plans by each country.  The global water crisis was the theme of the 2006 human development report, which was launched earlier this month in Dublin and a number of other capitals.  The report ranked Ireland fifth in the world in terms of the percentage share of bilateral aid allocated to water and sanitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">The White Paper on Irish Aid commits the Government to continue its support to activities which increase access to safe water and basic sanitation across the programme.  As the aid programme grows, and subject to nationally-agreed priorities of our partners in programme countries, we will intensify our support for programmes and projects which deliver clean water and sanitation services.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_315">
            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_664">At the launch of the human development report I addressed the issue of the contradiction concerning what is regarded as the management of water as a scarce resource which is used as a vehicle for imposing privatisation of water supplies in different countries.  This cannot be reconciled with the acceptance of water as a basic right.  If one accepts water as a basic right, one arrives at a different point.  This matter is not resolved in the UNDP report, as the Minister of State should know.  Even if the millennium development goals were achieved, it would still leave 800 million people without clean water and 1.8 billion people without sanitation.  Effectively, sub-Saharan Africa will not have access to clean water until 2040 and sanitation until 2076.  I do not misquote the Minister of State.  The world millennium development goals will only go so far.  Even if they were to be achieved, they would leave this legacy to which I referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">The Minister of State need not answer unless he wishes but General Covenant No. 15 clearly established the fact that it is not soft law anymore, it is hard law.  One cannot deny people the water they need.  This issue arises domestically.  As a result of our signature to that, we could not do so if we are to interpret it properly.  The second point in regard to the quotation the Minister of State has just given is the international aspect.  Is it the position that the Government is on the side of the "right to water" group rather than on the side of the World Bank which takes a view on the management of water as a scarce resource?  I remind the Minister that the way it works is that the World Bank advises that one shuts off the water to everybody and then allows them back on a charged basis.  The UNDP report posits a figure of 20 litres a day which is half the World Health Organisation figure.  The daily consumption in African countries is 5 litres, while it is 600 litres in the United States and 400 litres in Europe.  Is the Minister of State in favour of the rights-based approach to water provision or the World Bank limitation view which is about facilitating the privatisation of water resources under the scam of suggesting that a scarce resource is being managed?</p>

            <p eId="para_666">I assure the Deputy I incline more to his view than that of the World Bank.  However, I would emphasise that the World Bank has changed its approach to the privatisation of water and water utilities in African countries.  That change of heart, while not expressed overtly, has occurred since early 2005.  We do not incline to the World Bank definition.  We are co-sponsoring a draft resolution at the UN Human Rights Council, requesting the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to take forward a study on the scope and content of the relevant human rights obligations related to access to water under international human rights instruments.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">We are very much active in trying to guarantee that this right and obligation becomes precisely that, an obligation on domestic countries.  As the Deputy rightly stated — that is the important aspect to remember from a legal point of view about General Comment No. 15 — that it is primarily applicable in the domestic sense.  We cannot extend this right in an extra-territorial sense.  We must work with governments in our partner countries and fund them to ensure they can roll out and extend this particular obligation <i>vis-à-vis</i> their own citizens.</p>

It is hard law rather than soft law because one could interpret the universal declaration in the sense that a right to water is included under the right to health.  The reason I put General Covenant No. 15 into the question is that there is no capacity for any signatory to deny people access to the water they need on a "discriminatory basis".  One cannot exclude people without breaching international law on socio-economic grounds yet that is happening.  Contrary to what the Minister of State outlined, that is what the World Bank facilitated all over South America and what it attempted to impose in South Africa and several other African countries.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_335">
            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_689">The matter I raise relates to the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to sign or ratify the United Nations Protocol on Trafficking which dates to 2000 and the Council on European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings which dates to 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">In his capacity as Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan is probably aware that Ireland is in clear breach of its international obligations for failing to sign or ratify these two international instruments.  It is entirely unacceptable that Ireland has no specific, domestic legislation to outlaw trafficking in human beings within this country or into this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has contributed his usual lip service but nothing has been done during his four and a half years in office.  The inter-congregational group of religious orders has now taken up the cudgel.  I hope the Minister will lend it a more sympathetic ear than he has done to the Members of this House.  No doubt we will have copious promises of future action from the Minister but it is unlikely that anything will be done before the election takes place in six months time.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">The stark reality is that trafficking in human beings is one of the biggest and most appalling multinational industries in the world.  The startling statistics demonstrate that more people were traded into slavery in one decade of the 1980s, from Asia alone, than all the people sold into slavery from Africa in the 400 years in which slavery legally existed.  Sixteen years later, the incidence of trafficking has increased substantially.  It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million people are trafficked annually, more than 50% of whom come through various European countries.  The industry is estimated to be worth a whopping €36 billion in Europe alone.  Almost every city, town, or village in eastern and central Europe has girls and young women, in particular, victimised by the traffickers who force them into the human exploitation industry.  With the opening up of the European Union borders, the movement of traffickers and their prey is largely invisible.  The risks are few and the profits are enormous.  Trafficking is now the third largest money making venture in the world after illegal weapons and illegal drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">Clearly, we can no longer turn a blind eye to what is becoming increasingly an Irish phenomenon.  Experience on the ground in Ireland and research conducted at the Johns Hopkins University confirm that the trafficking Mafia are now targeting Ireland as a growing lucrative market and a port of entry.  The Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are well aware of the growing incidence of trafficking of women for the sex industry.  It is essential that we take urgent action now before trafficking in humans goes the deadly way of illegal weapons and illegal drugs.  The Government failed to act when the warning signs were there.  Now gangland killings are widespread and there are illegal drugs distribution networks throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">The Government must ratify international conventions and protocols, which it has not done to date.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must introduce legislation to target the traffickers with heavy penalties and give the Garda the necessary powers to track them down, seize their assets and put them out of business as well as putting them behind bars.  He must establish a special rapid reaction team of gardaí who can link up quickly and effectively with Europol and Interpol to monitor the activities of the international trafficking gangs and pursue them anywhere in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">The Minister must acknowledge that trafficking in humans is a grave violation of human rights.  He must, therefore, put in place a public awareness programme to inform the public and encourage victims to come forward.  That will require legislation that not only targets the traffickers but also incorporates protective and support measures for the victims so that they do not end up being further victimised.  A victim-centred approach is required.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_336">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_696">I thank Deputy Costello for raising this very important issue and for giving me the opportunity of updating the House on this matter on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">Human trafficking, by its very nature, is a clandestine activity.  It is a crime which can have very deep and lasting effects on its victims.  The use of force or intimidation by those who engage in the activity of trafficking may cause victims to be reluctant to come forward to the authorities.  In spite of whatever reluctance there may be to come forward with information, it is in the best interests of all concerned, as with all other forms of crime, that any acts of criminality, or suspected criminality, are brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána.  It is important to note that those people who come forward to the Garda Síochána are treated at all times with respect, dignity and sympathy.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">When victims of trafficking come to the attention of the authorities, they are provided with all assistance possible.  Assistance may be provided through the services of the Health Services Executive in this respect.  Victims of trafficking can also be assisted to return and reintegrate in their countries of origin with the assistance of the International Organisation for Migration.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, in the recent UN Trafficking in Persons Global Patterns report, Ireland was ranked at the low end of destination or transit target countries in Western Europe.  The Garda assessment of the situation concurs with the UN report.  In common with other EU countries, all the indications to date are that in Ireland trafficking in human beings takes place on a much smaller scale than illegal immigration.  Many more people are brought here on a voluntary basis than are brought here against their will.  That said, the Garda Síochána remains very active in this area in terms of its intelligence gathering, surveillance and investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">A number of specific Garda operations have been put in place to assess the extent to which Ireland may have been targeted by persons suspected of being engaged in trafficking in persons, to prevent such activity and, where such activity is disclosed, to gather evidence to be used in any prosecution.  Operation Quest, for example, was established to investigate allegations of trafficking of non-nationals into this country for the purpose of employment in the sex industry.  Operation Pentameter was set up with the objective of disrupting the activities of organised criminal gangs suspected of involvement in trafficking of persons.  To date, there is no evidence to suggest that trafficking of persons into Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation is widespread.  The Garda has encountered only a small number of trafficking cases and these are being fully investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">However, there is no room for complacency on this serious issue.  The Garda continues to fully engage with other international law enforcement agencies on an ongoing basis to ensure that a comprehensive and effective response to the issue of trafficking is in place.  In October 2005, an anti-trafficking working group was set up comprising officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and members of the Garda Síochána.  The report of this working group was published in May 2006 and is available on the Department's website.  This document sets out clearly the situation in Ireland and the State's response on a number of fronts including immigration controls, law enforcement activity, protection of victims and the legislative framework.  NGOs reported to that working group on the excellent co-operation that they have with the Garda, particularly at an operational level.  The publication of this report is clear evidence that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána are committed to tackling trafficking in human beings at a national level and to working with our European Union and other countries to tackle it on an international basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">Under current Irish criminal law it is an offence, punishable by up to life imprisonment, to traffic a person under 17 years of age, male or female, into, through or out of Ireland for the purpose of that person's sexual exploitation.  This is provided for in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  The Government has approved amendments to the legislation that will change the age from 17 to 18 years to allow Ireland to comply with the various international obligations.  Under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, it is an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into Ireland of a person who is reasonably believed to be an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to claim asylum.  In this case the maximum prison sentence on conviction is ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">Legislation creating an offence of trafficking in persons for the specific purpose of sexual or labour exploitation is contained in the draft Criminal Justice (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill.  This Bill will comply with the EU Framework Decision on combating trafficking in persons for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation.  It will also fully comply with the criminal law requirements of the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, which supplements the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime and the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_339">
            <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_705">I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise once again the ever increasing problem of graffiti in our city.  At the beginning of the summer I raised this issue in the hope that the Government would take action to deal with it.  Sadly, very little has been done and the complaints from constituents about this issue continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">It seems this Government, consisting of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, does not recognise litter, dog dirt or graffiti as problems.  It has been in power since 1997 and has done very little about any of these issues.  As the general election approaches I give a commitment on behalf of my party to deal with these problems by introducing specific legislation and through a co-ordinated, targeted approach, an approach which has worked elsewhere and will work here as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">On the question of graffiti we need to distinguish between street art and what is known as tagging.  Much street art has artistic merit and the Green Party believes we ought to engage in a dialogue between local authorities and street artists to provide areas where they can express themselves.  There are many areas in the city where blank walls could be provided for street artists.  I understand that discussions are already under way between Dublin City Council and street artists to provide five such blank walls in the city.  We should also look at the whole issue of shop fronts, particularly the proliferation of ugly shutters.  These are a magnet for taggers.  Shutters should be put on the inside.  If they are on the outside perhaps we could have an arrangement with graffiti artists to beautify these very ugly shop fronts.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">We need to make that distinction between street art and tagging.  There is little artistic merit to tagging.  In my constituency I have seen the walls of pensioners' houses ruined with tagging, which is the result of someone spraying their initials or a symbol to mark out their territory, much like an animal does in the wild.  In other cities throughout Europe such Paris and Berlin, tagging has reached epidemic proportions.  I have seen it not just on the walls of houses but also on playground equipment, on public transport and even inside public transport.  I do not know who has given some individuals the right to deface community or public property.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">We need investment in removing graffiti.  We must also introduce penalties as a deterrent.  If we had a dedicated unit in the Garda working side by side with local authorities and equipped with camcorders and digital cameras, we would quickly determine who was carrying out this vandalism.  These individuals should be named and shamed.  Let us not fall into the trap of thinking that those engaged in tagging or graffiti vandalism, as it ought to be known, are somehow from deprived backgrounds.  It is not the case.  Many of these people are from well-off backgrounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">I have seen little evidence of political graffiti.  If people want to express themselves politically they can do so on these blank walls or through proper political agitation.  The Criminal Damage Act 1991 and the Litter Pollution Act 1997 are not adequate to deal with the increasing problem of graffiti vandalism.  I contrast the lack of strategy and policy in Ireland with the coherent approach elsewhere.  I have a document entitled Combating Graffiti, which is jointly signed by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, and its police commissioner, Raymond Kelly.  This booklet, which is distributed among the community, defines graffiti, outlines the strategies to combat graffiti and gives useful telephone numbers to call if one sees graffiti vandalism taking place or one wants graffiti removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">In the section on laws to combat graffiti, we are told that the New York administrative code penalises acts commonly known as graffiti vandalism; bans anyone possessing aerosol spray or broad-tipped indelible markers in a public building or facility with the intent to make graffiti; restricts the sale of these items to anyone under the age of 18; prohibits sellers of aerosol spray paint and indelible markers from displaying these items in their stores.  The document also outlines the role of the police force in preventing graffiti, stating:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_712">The Police Department has established a City-Wide Vandals Task Force.  The Task Force will create and implement the strategies and tactics for dealing with graffiti vandalism and defacement of public and private property.  The Task Force will also administer the Graffiti Reward Program.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">The section on the graffiti rewards programme states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_714">Members of the public are eligible for up to a five hundred dollars ($500.00) reward for reporting graffiti vandalism. . . . The information must result in the arrest and conviction of individual(s) for violations.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">Bakersfield with one quarter the population of this city has one police lieutenant responsible for a programme of oversight.  It also has city council public referral-interdepartmental service co-ordination, one police sergeant, and one full-time and one part-time police officer.  We have nothing like this.  We have no co-ordinated approach and I call on the Government to make an effort to combat this serious problem.</p>

I am standing in for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline the position on this issue.  Graffiti is still a problem in and a blight on our society and our urban landscape.  There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this view.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, primary responsibility for management and enforcement responses to the defacement of structures by writing or other marks lies with local authorities.  However, conscious of the problem of graffiti vandalism, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs initiated a pilot project, the graffiti removal operation, GRO, initiative, aimed specifically at combating graffiti in Dublin city, Galway city and Bray, County Wicklow.  This project is separate from, and in addition to, the graffiti abatement programmes carried out on an ongoing basis by the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">The GRO initiative involves a major initial clean up of the worst affected sites in the pilot areas, followed by a rapid response cleaning maintenance programme aimed at maintaining sites free of graffiti.  To date all sites in RAPID areas have been addressed and significant cleaning works have already been completed.  Work has already been completed, or is in progress, in 19 separate locations in the Dublin City Council, Bray Town Council and Galway City Council areas.  Sites affected by graffiti outside RAPID areas are being surveyed with a view to extending the GRO initiative.  The pilot project is overseen by a steering group comprising representatives from the three Departments and an independent evaluation of the programme has been commissioned in order to determine the programme's effectiveness.  Should the programme prove successful in eliminating or significantly reducing the incidence of graffiti, consideration will be given to extending it to other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is satisfied that there are adequate powers under the Litter Pollution Acts to tackle the problem of defacement of property.  Section 19 makes it an offence to deface property and section 20 is a complementary provision which enables local authorities to have remedial action taken.  In addition to the Litter Pollution Acts, the Criminal Damage Act 1991 provides for the offences of damaging or defacing property.  The Garda authorities take very seriously the damaging or defacing of property.  The Garda has operations Encounter and Assist in place, focusing on tackling anti-social behaviour including offences of criminal damage, such as defacing property or the imposition of graffiti.  When the Garda detects such offences, culprits are processed through the courts or via the juvenile liaison system, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">On deterring young people from criminal behaviour, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform funds Garda youth diversion projects.  These projects are community-based, multi-agency initiatives that aim to divert young people from becoming involved in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and challenge offending behaviour.  The number of such projects has grown from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, catering for approximately 2,500 persons per annum.</p>

          <heading>Care of the Elderly.</heading>
          <speech by="#BeverleyCooperFlynn" eId="spk_341">
            <from>Ms Cooper-Flynn</from>
            <p eId="para_721">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.  I tabled a motion on the Order Paper earlier this week about establishing a commission for the status of older people to monitor and oversee progress on issues of particular relevance to older people and to establish a dedicated Department for the elderly with a Minister with responsibility for the elderly appointed by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">Some 11% of the population, 465,000 people, is older than 65.  It is projected that by 2026, 17% of the population will be older than 65.  In the last general election, 71% of the people aged over 65 voted, whereas less than 38% of people in the 18 to 25 category voted.  In reality the older people elect governments, but probably have least say despite the many serious issues affecting them.  We all recognise they have contributed significantly throughout their lives to the economic and social development of the country and the prosperity we now enjoy.  As a society we owe a duty of care to our older population.  It is a true measure of a nation's sense of value that it gives the respect to older people that they deserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">Combat Poverty Agency has advised that 27% of the older people, 123,000 people, are in the poverty trap and are living on less than €185 per week.  The State pension of €185 per week is less than 34% of the average industrial wage.  We are the lowest of the OECD countries where the average pension is 68.7% of the average industrial wage, which indicates a significant gap.  Many of our older people are now caught in a poverty trap and feel they cannot speak out because of the affluence of today's society.  In many opinion polls, the cost of living is identified as the biggest issue for elderly people.  While they say so privately in opinion polls, they find it difficult to speak out.  When I have attended public meetings involving Age Action Ireland and the older citizens in my constituency, these have been the issues mentioned as causing them great concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">On many occasions I have spoken in this House about the discrimination in nursing home subventions.  In the west a person can get a maximum subvention of €190.50, whereas a person living in Dublin can get €850 per week.  I have already received a commitment from the Minister for Health and Children that equalisation of those subvention rates will be introduced.  However, a new applicant in County Mayo still cannot get an enhanced subvention.  It is a disgrace and needs to be rectified as a matter of urgency.  A person qualifying for maximum subvention, who is unlucky enough not to be able to get a public bed and is forced to go into a private nursing home, will only get 30% of the cost of the private nursing home bed, which means many elderly people cannot afford to go into private nursing homes and as a result live at home, often in dreadful circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">The rural transport initiative was a wonderful innovation on the part of the Government but it is not sufficient and needs to be extended.  Further public funding must be put in place.  Older people recognise it as an excellent service, but in many instances voluntary groups of elderly people are coming together to enhance the service provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">Access to public services has arisen as a problem, particularly in the context of ageism in the health care area.  The maximum age for breast screening is 65 and for cervical screening it is 60.  Breast screening is not yet available in the west.  When it is introduced, is it correct that the maximum age for the service should be 65?</p>
            <p eId="para_727">There is discrimination against elderly people in respect of driving licences and the cost of motor insurance.  Travel insurance for a person over the age of 65 is three times that relating to a person under 65.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Many women of my mother's generation who gave up their jobs to look after their children are now retired and have no incomes on their own.  Some mechanism must be found to provide people in this category with incomes.  Every woman in the country should have an independent income.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">There is a need to enhance home help services, home-care packages and night nurse facilities for people who need them.  Funding must be given to voluntary groups to assist elderly people.  The two biggest complaints from elderly people to the Equality Authority related to insurance costs and the service costs with which these individuals are faced.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">I articulated a particular point on a number of recent occasions and I mentioned it to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.  I refer to the adult dependant allowance.  A commitment was given in the programme for Government to increase this allowance to 100% of the principal recipient's payment.  However, that has not happened.  It was also stated that it would, in most cases, be paid to the woman in her own right.  The Minister has indicated that he takes the issue seriously and I hope he will announce something in the budget.</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_737">On foot of the way in which our pensions system is organised, surveys such as those presented by the OECD in, for instance, its publication Pensions at a Glance can provide a distorted picture of the economic position of older people in Ireland.  The survey focuses on the cash income provided through state pension systems and, in our case, makes no allowance for the role played by private occupational pensions or for the additional supports — such as electricity and gas allowances — provided to pensioners through the household benefits scheme or through the provision of medical cards, etc.  Furthermore the very high level of home ownership among older people here is not reflected in such surveys and also impacts on the resources available to people in retirement.  Accordingly, while such surveys are useful to compare aspects of the pensions systems across other countries, they are not, for the reasons outlined, a true indication of the economic position of our older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">In respect of income poverty specifically, the most recent EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions for 2005, published this week by the Central Statistics Office, found that the percentage of older people below the 60% median income threshold has decreased from 27% to 20% in just one year.  The latter compares to a rate of 18.5% for the population as a whole.  This does not include the impact of the major pension increases provided for in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The needs of older people will remain a priority for the Government and this has been demonstrated by the numerous initiatives which have been taken in the past ten years in the area of pensions, supports for carers and household benefits.  For example, since 1996 pensions have increased by almost 104%, or nearly 50% in real terms, faster than both price and wages growth in the same period.  The Government is committed to achieving a target rate of €200 per week for social welfare pensions by 2007.  In this regard, the budget to be presented next month by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will be a landmark event.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">Within the existing structure of social welfare pensions, which are based on contributory and means-tested payments, measures have been taken to provide personal pension payments to those who may have less than complete insurance records as a result of leaving the paid workforce to care for children or incapacitated people.  These include the introduction of the homemakers scheme — which covers periods of caring from 1994 and under which up to 20 years spent on home duties can be disregarded in calculating pension entitlement — and an easing of qualifying conditions for both contributory and non-contributory pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">There are women who, for various reasons and despite the changes that have been introduced, remain outside the social welfare pensions system.  Their position, as well as that of others who are not covered by social welfare pensions, will be considered in the context of the Green Paper on pensions to which the Government is committed as part of the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices, the challenges in this area — including outstanding issues on social welfare pensions — and the views of the social partners.  The Government is committed to responding to the consultations on foot of the Green Paper's publication and to developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the longer term.  It is expected that the Green Paper will be published at the end of March next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">The Department of Social and Family Affairs has responsibility for the provision of income support for carers and co-operates with other Departments on this issue, as appropriate.  Issues relating to nursing home subvention rates are primarily a matter for the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive.  Under the current assignment of responsibilities among Ministers of State, Deputy Seán Power, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, has special responsibility for older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs was established following the publication of the Mercer report, Study to Examine the Future Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland.  The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the consultation that was undertaken following that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme.  The report of the group is currently being considered and I expect a decision to be taken in respect of this matter in the future.</p>

          <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_349">
            <from>Ms Harkin</from>
            <p eId="para_744">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the provision of a new community school in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.  As the Minister of State is aware, this is a long-running saga.  A new community school was promised in 2001.  Five years later, parents, teachers and students are still waiting for it.  The Minister of State will be aware of the particular difficulties faced by the pupils and teachers at Ballinamore.  The post-primary school operates between three different sites and students are obliged to travel up to 1 km between classes.  This is totally unacceptable and the community in Ballinamore is becoming increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress.  There are also serious health and safety concerns involved.  Surely the pupils and teachers should not be obliged to put up with this situation any longer.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">As already stated, the provision of a new school was sanctioned in 2001 prior to the last general election.  In the interim, a full-year group of students have completed their entire secondary education in the unacceptable conditions to which I refer.  Despite the fact that the Department of Education and Science predicted that a new school would open in 2003, the Ballinamore community school action group was this week obliged to launch a letter-writing campaign to highlight the delays in providing a new secondary school.  One can imagine the frustration of the members of this group who, following a long campaign, are still in the position where they must write letters to the Minister for Education and Science.  I am aware of the announcement last week that a possible site for a new school has been selected and that negotiations are under way.  However, this has happened on several previous occasions.  The community in Ballinamore needs a new school now and I ask that the Minister of State give a commitment that it will be provided within a specific timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">I am also pleased to have the opportunity to raise the urgent need to provide a primary school at Dromore West, County Sligo.  Parents of children who attend Dromore West central national school are extremely frustrated by the continuing delays.  Plan after plan for their new school has been submitted and then rejected.  The parents are also concerned about the terrible conditions that obtain in the school.  These conditions continue to deteriorate.  The Health and Safety Authority has already expressed a real concern regarding the hopelessly overcrowded conditions that the teachers and pupils must endure every day.  Those conditions read like something from a Dickensian novel.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">One teacher operates solo in the old church classroom.  Staff members must boil a kettle to make a cup of tea in the classroom and, having finished their tea, they must wash the cup in the same hand basin in which they wash their hands.  The so-called office of the school secretary is in a tiny girls' cloakroom and she has the pleasure of sharing this cubbyhole with the principal when she is involved in administrative duties.  Recently a male teacher taught in the school and he did not even have the luxury of a toilet to use.  How can any teacher or student be expected to spend his or her days in these conditions?</p>
            <p eId="para_748">It is difficult to believe that, according to the statistics, Ireland is the second richest country in Europe.  Many of my colleagues in the European Parliament look to Ireland as an example of economic success.  There is not much sign of such success in Dromore West primary school.  I am sure the Minister of State believes no teacher or student should have to endure these conditions.  The parents, teachers and students need a new school, large enough to accommodate the expanding population of the village, for which 100 new houses are proposed.  While the process is under way, the community wants a guarantee from the Minister that there will be no further delays or hold ups.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_350" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_749">I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline the proposals of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of a new community school in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, and also the need for a new school in Dromore.  Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under investment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  As evidence of this commitment, approximately 1,300 building and modernisation projects will be active in our primary and post-primary schools during 2006.  More than €500 million is being spent on primary and post-primary projects throughout the country.  This unprecedented capital investment is testament to the importance this Government places to improving the quality of accommodation in our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">I refer to the specific matters raised.  In 1994 two second level schools, Our Lady of Fatima convent secondary school and St. Feilim's College, amalgamated in Ballinamore.  The newly amalgamated school continued to operate from two separate buildings situated half a mile apart.  In 2001, a further amalgamation was agreed involving the local vocational school and a common enrolment policy was put in place.  The management model for the proposed school was referred to the then Minister for Education who, in May 2001, decided in favour of a community school.  The long-term projected enrolment for the new community school is expected to be approximately 400 pupils.  The need for a new school building to house the amalgamated schools is acknowledged by the Department and, as an amalgamation project, the building project for the new community school has a band rating of 1.4 in line with the revised prioritisation criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">A suitable site for the new school building is required before architectural planning can commence.  The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in site acquisitions generally, has been exploring the possibility of acquiring a site for Ballinamore community school.  A number of options have been considered, including the site of one of the existing schools as the site of amalgamation.  The preferred option, however, is the location of the new school on a greenfield site.  Over the past few years a number of sites have been identified as a location for the proposed new school but their acquisition met with difficulties.  Following a re-advertisement for sites, new proposals were received.  All site options were examined by the OPW, which has identified what it considers to be the most suitable site available. The Department has conveyed its approval to the OPW to pursue the acquisition of this site as soon as possible.  Due to the commercial sensitivities of site acquisitions, it is not proposed at this stage to identify specific sites under consideration.  When a suitable site has been secured, the building project for Ballinamore will be considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme 2006-2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">The building project for Dromore West national school was one of a number approved by the Department announced 2005 to progress to architectural planning.  This project is at stage 3 — developed sketch scheme.  The brief is to provide adequate accommodation for a principal and four classroom teachers, with the possibility of future expansion.  A letter issued to the board of management in May 2006 requesting additional stage 3 information, which was submitted by the board in August 2006.  The stage 3 submission received in the Department deviated from the agreed brief for the building project and, consequently, the Department wrote to the board of management seeking a revised stage 3, in accordance with the agreed brief.  When the revised stage 3 submission is received in the Department, a meeting will be convened, which will involve the board of management representative and the design team presenting the submission, outlining key aspects of same.  Any issues or commentary by the Department will be addressed at the meeting and the minutes of the meeting will issue to the school afterwards as a formal record of the meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">It is envisaged that, unless there are very exceptional circumstances involved, the meeting will be sufficient to authorise the project to progress to the next stage of architectural planning, subject, if necessary, to formal confirmation by the school and the design team that issues raised by the Department have been addressed.  In the case of all large capital projects on hand within the school building section, progression of projects to construction will be considered in the context of the school building programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_757">I met the Secretary General of Amnesty International, Ms. Irene Khan, in London on Wednesday 8 November. The meeting was a useful opportunity to exchange views and discuss common ground with one of the leading global human rights organisations.  Our discussions centred on the situation in Darfur and the role of the new United Nations Human Rights Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">On Darfur, I briefed Ms. Khan on my visit to the region last July and on my discussions with the Sudanese Foreign Minister then and in September. I also recalled that I had highlighted the situation in Darfur in my address to the UN General Assembly. I expressed my serious concern at the ongoing human rights violations in the region and assured Ms. Khan that Ireland would continue to do all it can at an international level to bring these gross human rights violations to an end, above all through achieving agreement on a robust peace-keeping force. Ms. Khan gave me an account of Amnesty's important work in relation to Darfur. She emphasised the important role of the Egyptian Government and it was partly in response to her suggestion that, as indicated in my earlier reply, I recently wrote to my Egyptian colleague.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">On the UN Human Rights Council, which was established earlier this year, we exchanged views on the early stages of its operation. Ms. Khan outlined Amnesty's view of the challenges facing the Council. I reiterated Ireland's support for an active presence for civil society at the Council and we discussed practical ways in which this might be facilitated.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">We also discussed briefly the situation in the Middle East and the recent deployment of Irish troops to Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">I also availed of the meeting to underline Ireland's strong and forceful opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition, which Ms. Khan acknowledged.</p>

            <p eId="para_763">I understand that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has indicated that he intends to begin a debate on the possible revision of the Japanese constitution. In his Policy Speech to the 165th Session of the Diet, Prime Minister Abe noted that the current Constitution was formulated nearly 60 years ago when Japan was under military occupation, and that discussions were ongoing within and among the government and opposition parties regarding "the formulation of a constitution that befits a new era". The Prime Minister has not set an exact timeframe for the possible revision of the Constitution, though he has indicated in a recent press interview that he envisages addressing this issue within the next six years, the maximum period he may serve as Prime Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">Japan is an important partner for Ireland and the EU, with whom we share fundamental values such as democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and with whom we cooperate for peace, security and the prosperity of the international community. Japan is an active member of many international organisations. It is a major contributor financially and in peace-keeping to the UN, and a very significant aid donor. In 2007 we will be marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">Prime Minister Abe has made clear in various fora that Japan seeks to engage in active diplomacy not only in Japan's national interest but in the interest of the region's peace and prosperity. To that end he has already sought to strengthen Japan's partnerships with other countries, including its bilateral relations with the countries of the region, notably China and the Republic of Korea, and I welcome these moves. Japan is also active in Six Party Talks on the DPRK, the recent missile and nuclear weapons tests which are rightly of grave concern to it, as they are to the rest of the international community. Overall, and indeed against the above background, I take the view that the content of the Japanese Constitution is primarily a matter for the Japanese people alone.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_353">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_767">The 2007 Estimates for my Department include a total provision of €208.8 million for Vote 28 and €728.7 million for Vote 29 dealing with development assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The Vote 29 Estimate represents a further substantial increase in our assistance to developing countries, from just over €600m this year to €728m in 2007. In addition, the Estimates provide €85 million for development aid through other Government Departments, bringing Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2007 to €813m. This increased allocation amounts to 0.5% of Ireland's GNP, fully meeting the Government's interim target for 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">In terms of our size, Ireland continues to be one of the most generous donors in the world. The 2007 Estimates demonstrate the commitment of the Government to meet, by 2012, the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP in development aid. The increase in aid from this year to next will amount to €130 million, which was the total amount of development aid Ireland provided ten years ago.  Increased funds for Irish Aid will allow us to expand key areas of our programme, including Ireland's response to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies in developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">I am delighted that Vote 28 includes an allocation of €15.2 million for services to our emigrants abroad. This represents a 25% increase in funding compared to this year and a fifteen-fold increase in such provision since 1997. These figures clearly reflect the Government's strong commitment to the welfare of the Irish abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">Ireland's contributions to international organisations will increase from almost €26.4m this year to €31.9m next year. This is in keeping with the Government's continuing commitment to the role and work of the United Nations. I am also pleased that funds for North-South and Anglo-Irish cooperation projects, supported by the Department's Reconciliation Fund, will amount to €3m in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">Under the capital allocations, the Estimates provide €20m for the Department's programme of purchasing premises for its Missions abroad and refurbishing Embassy buildings owned by the State. The Department favours a decision to buy rather than rent property abroad where this is supported by a sound business case.</p>

            <p eId="para_775">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 93 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">The Government strongly supports the right of the people of the territory of Western Sahara to determine their own future. This has been the position of successive Irish Governments. The Government has no view on what that future should be — independence, integration with Morocco or some degree of autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. The essential point is that it be decided in a genuine act of self-determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">The Government has supported successive efforts by the United Nations to broker a solution to the issue of Western Sahara based on this principle. Following the ceasefire between Morocco and the Polisario Front in 1991, the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) was deployed in September 1991 to monitor the ceasefire and organise a referendum on the territory's future status. That referendum has yet to be held. In 1997, the former US Secretary of State James Baker, acting as the Personal Envoy of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, brokered the Settlement Plan between the two sides, but again this was not implemented. In 2003 he brought forward what is known as the Baker II Plan, which was endorsed by the Security Council in a number of Resolutions. Both these plans involved a referendum to determine the future of the Territory.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">One of the chief obstacles to the implementation of these plans has been the refusal of Morocco to accept a referendum in which independence is an option. I regret very much that Morocco has taken this view, and I look forward to the proposals which Morocco has stated it intends to present in the near future. The Government remains convinced that the full exercise of self-determination is the essential principle on which this dispute must be resolved. The Moroccan authorities are fully aware of this view.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">The position in relation to the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement was set out in detail in my reply to Question No 278 on 20 June 2006. The Agreement was negotiated by the Commission, discussed by Member States in the Fisheries Working Group, and adopted by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council under Qualified Majority Voting. In relation to territorial application, the Agreement used the same language as in previous EU Fisheries Agreements with Morocco, going back over many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">In relation to the Western Sahara issue, the Government's concerns were that the Agreement should imply no recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the territory, and that the benefits of any economic exploitation of Western Saharan resources under the Agreement should flow to the people of the territory.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">In voting in Council to approve the Agreement, which is of major importance to the fishing industries of a number of partners, Ireland made a National Declaration that it supported the Agreement on the basis that these two principles were respected. In particular, Ireland noted the duty of the EU-Morocco Joint Committee, envisaged under the Agreement, to ensure "that the Agreement is implemented to the benefit of all the people concerned and in accordance with the principles of international law".</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_785">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 82 and 117 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">Three Principal Development Specialists serve in Irish Aid headquarters in Dublin. None of the three has applied to decentralise to Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">There are twelve Senior Development Specialists at Irish Aid headquarters. None of the twelve is applying to decentralise to Limerick, though two originally did so, but subsequently withdrew their applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">Finally, there are nine Development Specialist posts at headquarters. Five Development Specialists originally applied to decentralise to Limerick and subsequently withdrew their applications. At present, four specialists who commenced employment since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003 are scheduled to decentralise.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">There is an ongoing Labour Court case regarding the terms and conditions under which technical grades are employed in various areas of the public service, including the specialists employed by Irish Aid. Technical staff employed by Government Departments and Offices, including specialists and other fixed-term workers employed in Irish Aid, brought cases to the Rights Commissioner under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, 2003. The case, which involves complex legal issues, has been referred to the European Court of First Instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">Some of the issues involved in the decentralisation of Irish Aid to Limerick have, therefore, a wider Civil Service dimension and must be resolved at the central level. Discussions are on-going with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance about the issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">Decentralisation is a Government decision and the Government is committed to moving ahead with its implementation. At present, 48 posts in the Directorate are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. A further 17 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, are also expected to decentralise to Limerick and will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in advance of the move. In addition, 21 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are currently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move. Once these officers take up duty in Irish Aid, 86 posts (69% of the Directorate's staff complement) will be in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">A small number of staff, approximately 15 at entry grades, will be recruited for direct assignment to Limerick in the months preceding the move.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">Almost all of the senior management team for Limerick will be in place by the end of this year. The Director General of Irish Aid has already indicated that he will decentralise to Limerick. There are now six Counsellors in place in the Directorate, who have volunteered to go to Limerick and a further two Counsellors will take up duty over the coming months. The changeover of the senior management team, just as in other grades, has been implemented in a planned and careful way so as to minimise disruption to the business of the Directorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">While there are challenges ahead, management and staff are working effectively together to maintain the quality and integrity of the programme. It would be my hope that a greater number of specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_796">HIV/AIDS is one of the foremost challenges in development, especially in Africa. The recently- launched White Paper on Irish Aid reaffirms the priority attached by the Government to addressing the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">The Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative provides assistance to countries to implement care, treatment and prevention programmes that can reverse the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">Three years ago, the Government signed an agreement with President Clinton committing the Government to allocating US$50 million to HIV/AIDS treatment programmes in developing countries. Mozambique was selected as the initial country of focus for the partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">Mozambique is greatly affected by HIV with more than 16% of adults between the ages of 15-49 infected. These additional resources have enabled the Government of Mozambique to successfully introduce HIV treatment into its public health response to HIV/AIDS. At the end of June this year, over 27,000 people were on HIV treatment. While excellent progress is being made, this is only 10% of those needing treatment and there are still big challenges ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">Based on the significant progress made to date, the many challenges still to be overcome and a positive interim review of the Irish-Clinton Foundation partnership, the Government decided to extend the partnership in Mozambique for a further five years from 2006-2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">The partnership is also being expanded to Lesotho this year. Lesotho is one of Irish Aid's partner countries and has one of the worst rates of HIV in the world. This is both a human tragedy and a tremendous barrier to development.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">On 29th September last, the Taoiseach signed a new agreement with President Clinton. This new agreement builds on the existing partnership and commits the Government to continue working with the Foundation up to 2010. The agreement commits Irish Aid to work jointly with the Foundation in Mozambique and Lesotho towards the achievement of three goals: to provide financial and technical support towards the implementation of national plans for the prevention, treatment, care and support of people affected by HIV/AIDS; to contribute towards the strengthening of the health system; and to respond to the crisis of human resources for health.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">This new agreement supersedes the previous agreement and provides for €70 million over the period 2006-2010. Of this amount, €60 million will go to Mozambique and €10 million to Lesotho. This support will be channelled through Ireland's missions in each country to the respective Ministries of Health. Irish Aid will meet with representatives from the Clinton Foundation in these countries on a regular basis to review cooperation and ensure the continued success of the partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">This is an important partnership and represents a major contribution by the Government to fighting HIV/AIDS and achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_808">I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 72 and 198 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">The conflict in Lebanon and the ongoing crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territories have underlined the urgent need for a renewed international effort towards a comprehensive settlement of the inter-related problems of the Middle East. At the heart of such a settlement must be a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. This is the only way forward for the Israeli and the Palestinian people. It is in the interests of Israel and of its neighbours, and it would remove a major source of the instability and tension across the Middle East which remains probably the greatest single threat to international peace and security.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">There is a strong view among EU Member States, which the Government shares, that any effort to reach a comprehensive settlement must take into account, and where possible accommodate, the concerns of all the key regional actors, which include Syria and Iran. Engagement with Syria and Iran by all concerned could be a very positive step, but it would nonetheless need to be carefully prepared. The possibilities and basis for such engagement are currently the subject of consideration and discussion within the EU, in Israel and across the Middle East, and in the United States. I welcome Prime Minister Blair's recent contribution to this debate. Clearly, Syria and Iran can also play a politically valuable role in the stabilisation of Iraq.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">The importance of Syria to an overall Middle East settlement is evident. Syria is the only one of Israel's neighbours with which a state of war technically still exists. A comprehensive peace must by definition involve Syria, which continues to seek the return of land occupied by Israel in 1967. It is encouraging that Syria has in recent years defined its goal as the achievement of a peace with Israel which will return the Golan Heights to Syria. Less encouraging, however, has been Syria's continued support for armed groups, the use of its territory to supply weapons to Hezbollah, and its long standing interference in the political affairs of Lebanon.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">Iran for its part, while not bordering Israel or Palestine, has significant concerns as a regional power with wide interests. It could potentially play a positive role in the promotion of a two-State solution, but regrettably has chosen so far not to do so. It continues to reject the Oslo process and to support violent groups. It has provided weapons to Hezbollah and others. Repeated extreme statements by President Ahmadinejad on the Holocaust and the existence of Israel have increased regional tensions. It plays an increasingly influential role in neighbouring Iraq. Aspects of Iran's nuclear programme have also seriously alarmed its neighbours and considerably added to fears of instability in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">In a major effort to resolve the nuclear issue diplomatically, the EU proposed in June a very significant package of measures which could bring about a new and improved relationship between Iran and the wider international community, including in regard to Iran's security. Unfortunately Iran has not so far responded positively to this offer. The offer remains on the table and the door to a more positive dialogue remains open, even as the situation receives consideration in the UN Security Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">Iran's relative international isolation has, of course, been heightened by the serious difficulties in its relations with the United States over several decades. The Government has warmly welcomed the support of the United States for the EU's efforts to engage constructively with Iran. I believe that it would be helpful if Iran and the US were in due course to agree to engage in direct contacts on regional and international issues.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_821">I propose to take Questions Nos 16, 26, 63, 65, 197 and 206 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">The Government's general position on the situation in Darfur is outlined in Priority Question No. 2 of today.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">In his September 2006 monthly report on Darfur, the UN Secretary General expressed particular concern at the Government of Sudan's attempt to find a military solution to the crisis and its use of aerial bombardment that fails to distinguish between civilians and combatants. He also highlighted increased restrictions on humanitarian efforts, recurrent attacks on women and girls in IDP camps and a rise in the number of militia attacks on civilians. During October and November attacks on civilians have further increased. These terrible developments underline the urgency of putting in place an effective international peace keeping force in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">As regards contacts with the Ethiopian Government, I met Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa in July 2006 and I wrote to him on 15 September to urge him to encourage the President of Sudan to accept the deployment of the UN operation in Darfur, with a strong mandate for the protection of civilians and provision of security for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. I also argued forcefully for the transition to a UN force with the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia while I was in Addis Ababa in July, and found his approach to this issue to be positive and constructive.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">While China's approach to international relations is strongly conditioned by its attachment to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, it has in recent times sought to play a relatively constructive role in relation to Darfur. During the China/Africa Summit in Beijing on 4-5 November 2006, the Chinese President and Foreign Minister are believed to have stressed to President Bashir the need to engage with others to deal with Sudan's problems, particularly in Darfur. At the meeting in Addis Ababa on Darfur on 16 November, co-chaired by the UN and African Union, the Chinese representative made a strong appeal to Sudan to accept the UN Secretary-General's proposals for the deployment of a hybrid UN/African Union peacekeeping force.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">I regret that China has abstained on the various UN Security Council Resolutions dealing with Sudan/Darfur. However, it has provided US$4 million in budgetary support and humanitarian aid to AMIS, the African Union's ceasefire monitoring mission there. China also welcomed the signature of the January 2005 North/South Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement and committed 200 troops to UNMIS, the UN's peacekeeping operation in Southern Sudan. I welcome these positive contributions, but would urge China to now bring all its influence to bear on the Sudanese President to deliver on the agreement reached at the meeting in Addis Ababa on 16 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The economic relationship between China and Sudan is very important. According to the Sudanese Foreign Trade Ministry, China is Sudan's main commercial partner and largest investor. The state-owned China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) owns 40% of Sudan's largest oil venture, the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">It should be recalled that under the provisions of the January 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, 50% of oil proceeds in southern Sudan are for the use of the Government of Southern Sudan, an area which has suffered extensively from the conflict waged there over twenty years and which is much in need of development and investment. Southern Sudan obtained US$865 million from this source in September 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">According to Amnesty International, arms deliveries to Sudan from China since the 1990s have included ammunition, tanks, helicopters and fighter aircraft. In March 2005 the UN imposed an embargo on arms supplies to all parties to the conflict in Darfur. The UN's Sudan Sanctions Monitoring Experts have stated that much of the ammunition used by parties to the conflict in Darfur was manufactured in China. They also discovered that in October 2005 Chinese-manufactured military trucks procured by the Sudanese Ministry of Defence had been transferred to Darfur. The Experts have recommended that the UN's arms embargo should be extended throughout Sudan, like the current EU embargo, and that countries which supply military goods and services to Sudan should require end-use destination certification. However, these recommendations have not yet been implemented by the UN Security Council.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_832">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 37 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">The murder on 7 October of the most widely known investigative journalist and defender of freedom of expression in Russia, Anna Politkovskaya, was a heinous crime which shocked the entire international community. Her death is a tragic loss to all who work for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia, most of all in Chechnya. I regret to say also that justice has not been clearly seen to be done in a number of previous cases of killings of journalists in Russia. In order to demonstrate that there is no impunity for such crimes, it is imperative that the Russian authorities investigate thoroughly the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and bring its perpetrators to justice. This action is incumbent on any member in good standing of the Council of Europe and party to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Russian authorities have condemned the murder and repeatedly assured the EU that the investigation, which has been placed under the personal control of the respected Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, is a priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">Mandated by Ireland and other Member States, the EU Presidency has raised the case of Anna Politskovskaya with Russia on at least three occasions to date, including at the highest level. A Presidency statement issued on the day after the killing called for a thorough investigation. Prime Minister Vanhanen, as President of the European Council, raised the matter with President Putin at the dinner which followed the informal European Council in Lahti, Finland on 20 October. The case of Anna Politskovskaya and the wider question of the role of free media as an element of a functioning democracy were among the issues discussed at the fourth round of human rights consultations between the EU and Russia in Brussels on 8 November. The Presidency is expected to refer to the case again at tomorrow's EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">In recent years, in an overall context in which the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is not advancing and the space for genuine political pluralism is narrowing, freedom of the media has deteriorated in Russia. News coverage by State-owned and most privately-owned electronic media lacks independence. The print media, which has a narrower reach, has a more critical approach to the actions of the authorities; however changes in the ownership of some prominent dailies suggest that they too may become subject to increased pressures. There are fears that recent changes to the law on countering extremist activity, which is very vaguely defined, may make it easier to use against opposition politicians, human rights defenders and free media. The EU is monitoring closely the implementation of changes to the law governing the funding of foreign NGOs in Russia, which came into effect on 1 April last, because they give rise to similar concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">There are disturbing reports this week suggesting that Alexander Litvineko, a former Russian security agent living in Britain, might have been poisoned because he is an enemy of President Putin. The Russian authorities have dismissed the charge which, if proven, would be very grave.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">The EU has an intense engagement with Russia. Ireland participates fully in the development of common positions for EU contact with Russia at all levels. In particular we work with others to ensure that values issues, such as those raised by the Deputies, receive due attention.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_840">I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 44 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">The Government shares the widespread concern at the extremely difficult situation in Iraq. Developments have been dominated by the continuing deterioration in the security situation, and in particular the terrible consequences of the spiralling cycle of sectarian violence. There is at present no sign that the insurgency and the inter-communal violence across the country are being brought under control. It is clear that they are effectively blocking the political and reconstruction efforts of Iraq's first fully sovereign and democratic Government and Parliament. The worst violence has been between Shia and Sunni groups in Baghdad and central Iraq, but there has also been an increase in violence in the south of the country. The Kurdish area in the north has largely been unaffected by the violence, although there are dangerous signs of ethnic tensions in the disputed city of Kirkuk.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">Although there is no agreed estimate of the casualties from the insurgency, the inter-communal violence and the widespread resultant criminal activity, it is clear that the suffering of the Iraqi people has reached an appalling level. Credible media reports put the more recent monthly death toll in the region of 1,300. In response to the chaos, there has been substantial population movement, with many of those who can afford it moving to neighbouring countries and to Europe, and widespread internal relocation, as formerly mixed areas become polarised along communal lines. Estimates of the extent of this movement suggest perhaps a million people internally displaced.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">Against this background, it is difficult to remain optimistic about the impact of the democratic process, which was embraced in such a remarkable manner by the Iraqi people last year. A series of initiatives by the national unity Government to combat the violence, with the assistance of US and other international forces, have had little success. The apparent involvement of some units of the new Iraqi security forces, in some cases linked to Shia militias, has greatly strained relations between the parties in Government. There has been no progress in the review of the new democratic Constitution, which might have addressed some of the concerns of the Sunni community.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">The Government and our partners in the EU remain firmly committed to supporting the Iraq i people as they work to restore security and prosperity. Since 2003, the EU has provided over €700 million in assistance for reconstruction. Work is continuing under the auspices of the United Nations on the development of an International Compact for Iraq, which will coordinate assistance in partnership with the Iraqi Government, on the basis of its priorities. The EU will continue to offer all possible political, economic and technical support, including training for officials of the Iraqi criminal justice system.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">In considering the situation in Iraq, the primary concern of the international community must be the welfare of the people of the country. We believe that a secure and peaceful Iraq can only be assured through the maintenance of its territorial integrity, the development of shared political and other institutions and strong political and economic links with all the countries of the neighbouring region.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">I am aware of the criticisms of the conduct of the trial of former President Saddam Hussein and his co-defendants by organisations including Human Rights Watch. The accused were charged with specific and very serious crimes. I believe that the people of Iraq deserve to see those crimes accounted for. We welcomed the determination of the Iraqi authorities to pursue the legal process in extremely difficult circumstances. It would not be appropriate for me to comment now on the conduct of the legal process, other than to note that the trial was held in open court under Iraqi law, and was fully televised. The guilty verdicts are clearly a matter for the Iraqi courts. An appeals process is now underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">In relation to the death sentences imposed on Saddam Hussein and his co-defendants, I would emphasise that the Government, and our EU partners, have a clear policy against the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. The EU has conveyed its strong views on the use of the death penalty directly to the Iraqi Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_849">I refer the Deputy to previous replies to similar questions concerning the United Nations Convention against Corruption, most recently on 25 October 2006. The Convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in October 2003 and was signed on behalf of Ireland, when it opened for signature, in December 2003.

            <p eId="para_852">Vacancies in the Department are, in general, filled through the Public Appointments Service (PAS), which is the central recruiting body for the whole of the Civil Service. Competitions for positions within the Civil Service are advertised by the PAS in the recruitment pages of the national newspapers.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">The Department's graduate recruitment programme for posts at the diplomatic grade of Third Secretary is also operated by the PAS. Candidates must have a first or second class honours degree in any discipline or have qualified as a Solicitor or Barrister. A new Third Secretary recruitment competition will be advertised by the PAS in early 2007. Third Secretaries will be appointed from this competition to fill vacancies arising and it is expected that the first of them will take up duty in the Department next summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">The Department also recruits development specialists to work at headquarters and in missions overseas to provide specialist input to its overseas aid programme. As soon as ongoing discussions around the specialists' terms and conditions of employment are successfully completed, the Department, through the PAS, intends to recruit additional specialist staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">This year, the Department initiated a pilot scheme which offers six internships for recent graduates who hope to make a career in international development aid. The internships, which are for eight months, are designed to complement academic and professional knowledge by providing practical experience and an understanding of the realities of international development cooperation. Recruitment has just ended for the coming year. The scheme will be assessed at the end of the internships before a decision is taken on whether to recruit interns next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">In addition, the Department annually recruits four Stagiaires to work for up to twelve months in its Legal and Political Divisions.

In each case, successful candidates are placed on a panel following a competitive interview process.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">Finally, the Department from time to time advertises for Services Officer, Nightwatchperson and Cleaner positions through the FAS website. Panels are formed from which vacancies in these grades are filled. A competition for Services Officer and Nightwatchperson is underway at present. The panel, which will be formed arising from this competition, will run until 2008.  A competition for Cleaner positions will be advertised through FAS in the early months of next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_860">A specific Action Plan was adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council last December. This Action Plan is aimed at developing common standards, best practices and mechanisms to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings. It covers such issues as the coordination of EU action and the prosecution of offences linked to trafficking. Implementation of the Action Plan is being pursued by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, where Ireland is represented by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. At the June European Council, Heads of State and Government highlighted human trafficking as an area where further EU action is required.</p>

Ireland co-sponsored this resolution. In addition, through Irish Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs has contributed more than €1.7 million towards anti trafficking projects carried out by, amongst others, the International Labour Organisation.</p>

In the absence of a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem, the application of the laws and regulations of the Union to the northern part of the island is suspended. The issue of property rights is a crucial element in the search for a comprehensive settlement, on which the United Nations has the lead role, and will not be resolved until such a comprehensive settlement has been agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">Any Irish citizen considering the purchase of property in the area in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control should consider very carefully all the complex legal issues involved. I believe that it is important also to take full account of the political background. Any future comprehensive settlement in Cyprus will almost certainly include provisions on property rights which, depending on the particular circumstances, could have very serious practical or financial implications for people who have purchased property in the northern part of the island.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_871">I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 205 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">The IMF and World Bank have made increasing efforts to tackle the problem of debt in developing countries, since the launch of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996. The HIPC Initiative, which was strengthened and enhanced in 1999, sought to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels but did not entail cancellation. Ireland contributed some €30m towards the costs of implementation of the Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) agreed by the G8 Countries at Gleneagles in July 2005 and which came into effect on 1 July this year, goes further. It is a commitment to the cancellation of the multilateral debt owed to the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund of many of the poorest and most indebted countries in the world. Most of these countries are in Africa. For the first time, the most powerful countries have recognised that many poor countries need 100% debt relief if they are to address the development needs of their people seriously. This is an important basis from which we can continue to work for a complete and sustainable solution to the debt problem facing poor countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is separate from the earlier HIPC Initiative, but linked to it operationally. Under this new Initiative, cancellation of eligible debts is granted to countries which have completed the HIPC Initiative process, i.e. have already been judged as qualified to receive debt relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">From the information available to me, I am satisfied that these new commitments to debt write-off are being honoured. As of mid-August 2006, 29 countries of the 40 defined heavily indebted poor countries had received debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, amounting to US$28.8 billion. So far, 19 of these countries have also received MDRI debt relief from the IMF and World Bank, amounting to a further US$15.8 billion (US$12.8 billion from the World Bank and US$3.0 billion from the IMF). The total cost of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is estimated at US$48.9 billion in nominal terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The IMF share of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative's costs will largely be met by own resources, as authorised by IMF Members including Ireland. Ireland's additional share of the costs of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative amounts to €58.6m, out of the approximately US$37 billion total cost of debt relief to be provided by the World Bank.  As a gesture of support and to underline our strong commitment to 100% debt relief for the poorest countries, this amount has already been paid over in full.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_883">I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 66, 69, 71, 110 and 118 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">The Government is deeply concerned by the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The terrible violence of recent months serves to underline that there can be no military or unilateral solutions to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. The Government and our EU partners are determined to continue to work directly with the parties, and internationally, to revive a credible peace process in the Middle East. We have argued strongly that the only way forward for the Israeli and the Palestinian people is the negotiation of a viable two-State solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">The EU has consistently stated that all parties must demonstrate their commitment to the implementation of their obligations under the Quartet Roadmap, and under international law. The Government and our EU partners have consistently called on the Israeli Government to end all activities in the Occupied Territories which threaten to undermine the viability of a two-State solution and which are against international law. These include the expansion of settlements, the demolition of Palestinian homes and the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land. We have raised these issues directly with the Israeli Government, in conjunction with our EU partners, and at the United Nations. We will continue actively to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">As I stated in my reply to a Question on house demolitions on 2 November, the Government continues to follow the situation in East Jerusalem very closely, through the Representative Office in Ramallah and the Embassy in Tel Aviv, and in consultation with Palestinan, Israeli and Irish human rights groups and NGOs. The practice of house demolitions in East Jerusalem is closely linked to the issues of residency status and the expansion of settlements. The Israeli authorities have placed very severe restrictions on the building of houses by Palestinians in East Jerusalem and, in practice, have issued fewer than 100 building permits to Palestinians in the area annually. Many Palestinians have built homes without the permits required by the Israeli authorities because they believe they have no alternative. Both directly and in conjunction with our EU partners, the Government has made it clear to the Israeli Government that it must end the practice of demolition of these homes, which is contrary to international law.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The Deputies will be aware of the Government's strong views on the illegality of the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land. While we recognise the responsibility on the Israeli Government to provide for the security of its citizens, I have regularly expressed my serious concern about the negative consequences of the continuing construction of the barrier, both for the daily lives of the Palestinian people and for the viability of a just and lasting settlement. The Government has raised the issues involved directly with Israel, within the EU and at the United Nations. We have been to the fore in ensuring that the European Union continues to affirm that it will recognise no changes to the pre-1967 borders other than those negotiated between the parties in the context of a final status agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">We will continue to monitor developments in relation to the barrier and the construction of settlements, and to make our views known on their illegality. I am not aware of any Irish company which is involved in the construction by Israel of the separation barrier, or of new roads in the Occupied Territories.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">In our bilateral contacts with Israel, the Government has regularly conveyed its concerns about the human rights implications of Israeli security policies and the importance of full compliance with international humanitarian law. The EU has serious concerns about the practice of administrative detention in Israel and the Occupied Territories. We have ensured that they are addressed in the EU's continuing political dialogue with Israel. Most recently, the Union's specific concerns about administrative detention were raised at the meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council in Luxembourg on 13 June and at the EU-Israel Sub-Committee on Political Dialogue in Brussels on 9 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">As Deputies will be aware from my replies to a series of Questions earlier this year, I remain concerned about the specific case mentioned, which has been raised with the Israeli authorities on a number of occasions by our Embassy in Tel Aviv. The person concerned was arrested on 23 May 2005, and on 16 June 2005 the Israeli authorities ordered his administrative detention for six months. Despite a number of appeals and reviews, the detention order has been extended continuously since then. Most recently, on 14 November, it was extended for a further four months. The Department and the Embassy in Tel Aviv are continuing to monitor the situation in cooperation with Embassies of other EU Member States and in consultation with Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_892">The National Day of Commemoration, held in remembrance of all those Irish men and women who died in past wars or in service with the UN, remains the official commemorative event for Irish war losses.

            <p eId="para_893">With regard to those "shot at dawn", Deputies will be aware that legislation was recently enacted in the British Parliament granting a statutory pardon to all soldiers executed for military offences during the First World War, including 26 Irish volunteers.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The Government offered strong support to the ‘Shot at Dawn' campaign in Ireland, and in particular took the issue up formally with the British Government through a comprehensive report in 2004. The Government has been actively engaged since then in finding a solution, and very much welcomes the outcome as a vindication of the memory of these men. The Government also notes that the legislation granting pardons has been welcomed by the campaign as the conclusion of its efforts on behalf of the families.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">I understand also that, consequent to the enactment of the pardon, the Irish War Memorial Trust is in the process of adding the names of those ‘shot at dawn' to the National War Memorial Records.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 40 and 101 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">Ireland has been calling for action on cluster munitions within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) since July 2002. We have consistently expressed our view that it is in the tradition of the CCW to address issues concerning weapons that have been shown to have indiscriminate effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">Accordingly, Ireland was one of six CCW States Parties (the others were Austria, the Holy See, Mexico, New Zealand and Sweden) which made a proposal last August for the Conventional Weapons Review Conference to draft a mandate for the negotiation of a legally binding instrument on cluster munitions. We welcomed, and were encouraged by, the appeal made by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, on the opening day of the Conference, to take urgent action to address the issue of cluster munitions. By the close of the Conference last Friday, a total of 25 States had supported our call for such a mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">The Conference operates by consensus, however, and the mandate agreed on Friday provides only for the urgent convening of a meeting of governmental experts "to consider further the application and implementation of existing international law to specific munitions that may cause explosive remnants of war, with particular focus on cluster munitions, including the factors affecting their reliability and their technical and design characteristics, with a view to minimising the humanitarian impact of these munitions."</p>
            <p eId="para_907">In a national statement on the closing day, we regretted that the Conference was unable to agree a more comprehensive mandate to deal with this grave humanitarian issue but signalled that we will continue to work within the CCW process, and elsewhere, to seek agreement on a legally binding instrument on the use of cluster munitions.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">Ireland also joined 24 other countries in a declaration recognising that cluster munitions are of serious humanitarian concern during and after armed conflict. The declaration called for an international agreement that would include a prohibition on the use of cluster munitions within concentrations of civilians and a prohibition on the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions that pose serious humanitarian hazards due to their unreliability and inaccuracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Ireland was also successful in introducing language into the Conference Final Declaration "noting the foreseeable effects of explosive remnants of war on civilian populations as a factor to be considered in applying the international humanitarian law rules on proportionality in attack and precautions in attack." This will increase the onus on military commanders in the field to give due weight to the foreseeable after-effects on civilian populations of whatever weapons and munitions are used on a given occasion. This is, however, no substitute for the international instrument on cluster munitions, which we believe to be necessary and which the Government will continue to pursue.</p>

            <p eId="para_912">I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 91 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">The question of Iran's nuclear programme is kept under constant review within the European Union at official level and is also the subject of regular discussions at Ministerial level. The most recent such discussion was at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting of 13-14 November in Brussels, where Ministers received an update on latest developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">There are currently no negotiations underway between the EU3 and Iran. Following Iran's failure to comply with the UN Security Council's 31 August deadline on suspension of enrichment-related activities, High Representative Solana, on behalf of the EU3, met with lead Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani on a number of occasions in September. However, these discussions failed to agree an acceptable formula for commencing negotiations. The EU side has been obliged, reluctantly, to conclude that Iran is not at this stage seriously interested in responding to the package of incentives presented to Teheran in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">As a result of Iran's failure to comply with the Security Council's 31 August deadline, as set in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696 of 31 July, the Security Council is currently discussing a second resolution that would impose additional restrictive measures on Iran, designed to increase pressure to comply with the Security Council's suspension demand. I would like to stress that the door to negotiations on the June package of incentives remains open should Iran choose to do what is necessary so that negotiations can commence.  Meanwhile, the latest report from the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr El Baradei, continues to confirm Iran's lack of cooperation with the Agency's efforts to resolve the outstanding questions related to its nuclear programme. The matter will again be discussed by the IAEA's Board of Governors which is currently in session.</p>

            <p eId="para_918">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 46 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">As I have previously informed the House, Ireland indicated to its EU partners in 2004 a positive disposition towards taking part in EU Battlegroups. I met the Foreign Ministers of Sweden and Finland in January 2005 and the Foreign Minister of Austria in April 2005 to discuss a range of issues, including possible Irish participation in EU Battlegroups. I also had the opportunity to discuss Ireland's expected participation in the Nordic Battlegroup with the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Jonas Gahr Store, during the visit of the Norwegian Royal couple in September of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">European Security and Defence Policy issues, including developments with regard to Battlegroups, are also discussed regularly at meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. The most recent of these discussions was at the joint meeting of Foreign and Defence Ministers in Brussels earlier this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">At its meeting on 14 November 2006, the Government decided that Ireland would provide a contingent of the Defence Forces to participate in the Nordic Battlegroup. This Battlegroup will be on standby in the first half of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">Our partners in the Battlegroup will be Sweden, Finland, Norway and Estonia. These countries have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the principles for the establishment and operation of the Battlegroup. The Memorandum recalls that the "fundamental framework for international relations is the United Nations". It stresses that "international law will govern the Battlegroup, taking into account the principles of the United Nations Charter", and "having regard to relevant UN Security Council Resolutions". The Memorandum further specifies that the "commitment of forces to the Battlegroup will be without prejudice to each Participant's sovereign right to make an autonomous decision on whether to deploy its forces to a specific crisis management operation". In Ireland's case, the arrangements of the "triple-lock" of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation will apply in respect of any possible deployment of Irish troops. Sweden, as framework nation, has confirmed that it fully accepts Ireland's position in this regard, as do the other participants in the Nordic Battlegroup.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_931">I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 41, 78, 84, 85, 96, 102 and 204 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">The Government is deeply concerned by the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and especially by the rising toll of death and destruction in Gaza. We have conveyed our position clearly and consistently in direct contacts with the parties, including the Israeli Ambassador in Dublin and the Israeli Government in Jerusalem, in cooperation with our partners in the EU, and at the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">I have unreservedly condemned the killing of 18 civilians, including women and children, in the shelling of Beit Hanoun by the Israeli Defence Forces on 8 November. I also condemn the killing of an Israeli woman in rocket attacks on Sderot on 15 November. The Government has called very clearly for an immediate end to all violence. This includes the Israeli military operation in Gaza and the firing of rockets on Israel from Palestinian Territory.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 13 November strongly deplored the Israeli military action in Gaza and the unacceptable military operation in Beit Hanoun. The Council underlined that any military action should not be disproportionate or in contravention of international humanitarian law. The Government and our EU partners have reminded all parties of their duty to protect civilian lives. Israel has a legitimate right to defend itself against attack, but not at the expense of the lives and welfare of innocent civilians. I believe it was particularly important that Ministers agreed on such a strong message at the meeting of the Council and responded to the situation in this way, not least in view of the perception of possible differences of approach as a result of the votes cast on the draft Resolution in the UN Security Council on 11 November, which has been raised in a number of questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">As Deputies will be aware also, an Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly on 17 November adopted a Resolution, which was introduced by the Palestinian delegation, which calls on Israel to cease immediately military operations which endanger the Palestinian civilian population in the Occupied Territories and withdraw its forces from within the Gaza Strip to their positions prior to 28 June 2006. The Resolution also calls on the Palestinian Authority to take immediate and sustained action to bring an end to violence, including the firing of rockets on Israeli territory. Following intensive coordination within the EU, in which our Permanent Mission to the United Nations was very actively involved, Ireland and all other EU Member States voted in favour of the Resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">The terrible violence of recent months underlines the urgent need to revive a credible peace process in the Middle East. There can be no military or unilateral solutions to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. We have argued consistently that the only way forward for the Israeli and the Palestinian people is the negotiation of a viable two-State solution. The Government and our EU partners strongly support the continuing efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to agree with Hamas and other Palestinian groupings on the formation of a national unity government. Given the context, it is not surprising that the negotiations have proved difficult, and that agreement has not yet been reached. There has been some evidence of differences of emphasis and approach in recent statements by spokesmen for Hamas.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">I have stated on many occasions that if agreement can be reached on a government committed to the negotiation of a two-State solution and based clearly on an end to violence, Ireland will argue strongly for a generous and creative political response from the EU and the wider international community. The Council on 13 November stated that a government with a platform reflecting the Quartet principles and allowing for early engagement would be a partner for the international community in re-launching the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The Government is convinced that the efforts of the EU in the Middle East must focus on actions which will improve the prospects for the achievement of a two-State solution. The operation of the EU — Israel Association Agreement promotes the dialogue which is essential if progress is to be made in rebuilding the peace process. Meetings of the Association Council with Israel also provide the opportunity for the EU to highlight its concerns on the human rights implications of Israeli security policies. I do not believe that the suspension of the Agreement, which would require consensus within the European Union, or other measures to restrict contacts, would serve the interests of any of the parties.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">The Government attaches the highest priority to the issue of the undocumented Irish in the United States. This issue is actively on the agenda of the Embassy and the Consulates in the United States in their on-going discussions with the Administration and on Capitol Hill.  I myself raise it in all my discussions with the US Authorities including, most recently, in a wide ranging discussion with the new United States Ambassador, on 1 November. I also had detailed discussions in New York on 10 November with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, an organisation that has been highly effective on Capitol Hill and beyond and which the Government has been supporting financially. I now look forward to further discussing and reviewing the prospects for immigration reform, in particular with key Members of the incoming Congress in the New Year. In this regard, my initial assessment is that the recent elections have given a boost to prospects for reform, though the issue remains a difficult and divisive issue both in Congress and in the United States generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">I should emphasise also that I very much welcome the continuing commitment of Senators Kennedy and McCain to the advancement of the comprehensive approach to immigration that they have long promoted and which the Government strongly supports. I also greatly appreciate the recent reiteration by President Bush of his on-going commitment to comprehensive reform in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">The Government's overriding objective continues to be to ensure that our undocumented citizens in the United States can regularise their status, travel freely to and from Ireland and ultimately secure a path to permanent residency. Despite all the difficulties and challenges, I look forward to further progress on this priority issue for the Government in the coming period.</p>

            <p eId="para_949">I am aware that President Lech Kaczynski of Poland was reported earlier this month to have said that the European Union should have an armed force of between 80,000 and 100,000 personnel, within the framework of NATO. While the leaders of Member States of the European Union and others are, of course, free to raise such ideas, I am not aware that Poland or any other Member State intends to put forward a formal proposal of this kind. In any case, all decisions related to the Union's Security and Defence Policy are taken by unanimity. Nor is there any current basis in the Treaties for the establishment of such a force.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_952">The Government very much welcomes the firm commitment in the St. Andrews Agreement that the British Government is to establish a Forum on a Bill of Rights and convene its inaugural meeting in December 2006. The Joint Declaration published by the two Governments on 1 May 2003, in the context of their ongoing work to achieve full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, explicitly committed the British Government to "work with the parties to facilitate the response to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's proposal for a round table forum on the Bill of Rights, involving the parties and civic society." It envisaged that the round table forum "will have an independent chair and its own secretariat, will be as inclusive as possible of Assembly parties and civic society, will appropriately involve the Human Rights Commission, mindful of its statutory role, and will be adequately supported and resourced."</p>
            <p eId="para_953">Since then, the Government has consistently raised the need for delivery on this commitment with the British Government, within the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. I discussed the issue with the Secretary of State at successive meetings of the BIIGC this year, where we also reviewed the useful discussions on a Bill of Rights between the political parties in the Assembly Preparation for Government Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The discussions at St. Andrews resulted in an explicit commitment by the British Government in Annex B of the St. Andrews Agreement to the establishment of a Forum on a Bill of Rights and to the convening of its inaugural meeting next month. In order to facilitate delivery on that commitment, a public consultation process was launched by the British Government on 14 November. The consultation invites views, <i>inter alia</i>, on the draft terms of reference for the proposed Forum, the timescale for the Forum to produce agreed recommendations and the Forum’s proposed size, membership and structure. The consultation is ongoing, but will be conducted within a tight timeframe. Responses have been requested by no later than 28 November next.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">On the question of Forum membership, the Government has always supported the involvement of political parties and civic society, as envisaged in the Joint Declaration. I made clear our support for such an inclusive Forum as the best means of facilitating debate on a Bill of Rights when I met with representatives of the Human Rights Consortium and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in Belfast in March of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The role of Chair will obviously be critical to the success of the Forum's deliberations. It is the Government's view that the Chair should be clearly independent, have relevant human rights expertise, and possess the skills necessary to facilitate effective discussions among Forum Members. I made these views known to the Secretary of State earlier this year. We firmly believe that, in line with the Joint Declaration commitment, the work of the Forum should be adequately supported and resourced. I welcome the clear statement of intent in that regard in the British Government's Consultation Document of 14 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">We will continue to engage with the British Government at political and official level in the coming weeks as preparations for the first meeting of the Forum proceed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_961">I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 98 and 112 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">A number of humanitarian crises in recent years have highlighted some shortcomings in the response mechanisms currently in use by the international community. This applies to both the response mechanisms of the European Union and of the United Nations. Efforts are underway to improve emergency responses internationally, which I fully support. Our Rapid Response Initiative complements these efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">The Rapid Response Initiative is designed to substantially enhance Ireland's response to humanitarian emergencies. Considerable progress has been made to date under its three elements:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_964">1. Pre-positioning and transportation of humanitarian supplies to disaster areas:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_965">On Friday 13 October, I signed a Letter of Understanding with Mr James Morris, Executive Director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) on the pre-positioning of humanitarian supplies. Under this two-year pilot programme, Irish Aid will fund the purchase and pre-positioning of humanitarian supplies at the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) — the UN's main rapid response base, managed by the WFP — in Brindisi, Italy. The Brindisi supplies will comprise shelter and other non-perishable housing items such as kitchen sets, blankets, plastic sheeting, tents and mosquito nets, and water supply and sanitation equipment to benefit approximately 20,000 people. Irish Aid has consulted widely with several UN agencies, other donor countries and NGO partners to ensure that the composition and design specifications of the supplies comply with international norms and standards. Work is ongoing in respect of the development of a similar facility at the Curragh which will handle supplies in respect of approximately 10,000 people.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_966">2. Establishment of a register of highly-skilled and experienced individuals for deployment at short notice to emergency situations:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_967">The idea behind the establishment of the register is to provide an opportunity for a Rapid Response Corps of skilled and experienced Irish personnel to serve at short notice in emergency situations. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) have been identified as appropriate partner agencies, which can provide the appropriate on-the-ground support for such personnel. Irish NGOs may also wish to use the register.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_968">3. Enhancing the emergency capacities of international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_969">Funding is being provided for the development of 4 regional humanitarian supply depots for UNHRD. Irish Aid will provide funding for the running costs of the regional humanitarian supply depot for Africa, which will be based in Accra, Ghana. Funding in the amount of €3.4 million will be disbursed in 2006 to strengthen the capacity of a number of key response mechanisms of the international humanitarian system — notably the key UN agencies and the Red Cross family.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">Irish Aid is working to improve humanitarian response capacities on a broad front through a number of activities complementary to the Rapid Response Initiative. I have provided €10 million in 2006 for the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) of the UN. This Fund is designed to provide rapid funding to agencies to enable them to respond much more quickly to emergency situations. I have pledged an additional €20 million for 2007. Funding is also being provided to the International Federation of the Red Cross to build local capacity to meet emergency needs. We are also in discussions with NGOs with the aim of assisting them to build more capacity in emergency response.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_972">As announced during the recent debate on the White Paper on Irish Aid in the Dáil on 2  November 2006, the Department of Foreign Affairs will distribute a booklet on the aid programme to each household in the country in January 2007.  The contents of the booklet will include a short overview of the White Paper on Irish Aid, information on the priority areas of work for Irish Aid and details of volunteering opportunities for Irish people.  This mail-out is taking place in the context of the need to strengthen public awareness of the aid programme as outlined in the White Paper and in the debates in the Dáil and Seanad. Throughout the extensive consultation process preceding publication of the White Paper, this emerged as a key concern for Irish people. Ensuring public awareness of the aims and activities of the aid programme will be all the more important as the level of resources committed to overseas development increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">The Government Supplies Agency in the OPW are currently tendering for the printing of the booklet as per public procurement guidelines. Following completion of the tender process, the booklet will be printed and distributed to approximately 1.6 million addresses by An Post over a two-week period beginning in the last week of January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The booklet will be funded from the Information and Communication budget within Irish Aid and the total cost of design, printing and distribution is estimated to be €310,000. The Information and Communication budget for 2006 represented 0.2% of the total ODA budget and it will remain the same for 2007.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_977">I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 207 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The Independent Electoral Commission of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced on 15 November that President Joseph Kabila had won the presidential election run-off contest held on 29 October, securing 58% of the votes against 42% for his opponent, Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba. The results are provisional until endorsed by the country's Supreme Court, a decision which is expected within a matter of days. Mr. Bemba has rejected the outcome while at the same time making clear that he will use all legal channels to contest it.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">The generally peaceful and orderly conduct of the elections in the DRC has been a tribute to the strong desire of the Congolese people for an end to conflict and the installation of democratic government. While some limited unrest has occurred, particularly following the announcement of the first-round results on 21-22 August, the presence of the EU's EUFOR mission, acting in support of the UN's MONUC peace-keeping mission and the Congolese security forces, has had a positive deterrent effect and has contributed to ensuring that such violent incidents were isolated. The priority now is for all parties in the DRC to respect the democratic verdict of the electorate, act within the law in dealing with any differences and work together to build a strong and inclusive government for the DRC and its people.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The European Union has played a key role in ensuring the successful completion of the transition process in the DRC. The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 13 November welcomed the conduct of the second round of the presidential election on 29 October and reiterated the EU's support for the new government and its efforts to develop the DRC. In addition to deployment of the EUFOR mission, whose mandate will end on 30 November, the EU and its Member States also contributed most of the financial support required for the holding of the elections. Nationally, Ireland contributed €1.3 million in support to the DRC electoral process and also provided seven members of the Permanent Defence Forces to serve with EUFOR.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Continued international engagement will be crucial if the DRC is to have any prospect of overcoming the very many political and developmental challenges in the period ahead. The EU is already extensively engaged in support of security sector reform in the DRC, through deployment of two ESDP missions, EUPOL and EUSEC. Consideration is currently being given to the EU assuming a lead role in the coordination of future international efforts in support of this vital sector. It is also desirable that the mandate of MONUC should be extended by the UN Security Council for a reasonable period, to allow it to deal with the continuing threat, posed not only to the DRC but to the Great Lakes region as a whole, by the remaining armed militias in eastern DRC.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The Government has contributed almost €12 million for emergency and recovery activities in the DRC since 2003, with €6.1 million provided to date in 2006. Ireland is committed to continuing to support the DRC, including through provision of emergency and recovery assistance as well as any other forms of assistance deemed appropriate, as that country moves into a new era of democracy and development.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_984">Agreement on the draft UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was reached on Friday 25 August 2006 by the Ad-Hoc Committee, established by the UN General Assembly in December 2001 to carry out this task. The draft Convention outlines the general obligations of States in relation to the rights of persons with disabilities. It aims to ensure that persons with disabilities are given an equal opportunity to enjoy their human rights and specifies that discrimination on the grounds of disability is impermissible.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">The text of the draft Convention is now being finalised by a Drafting Committee and the process of translating it into the official languages of the United Nations is under way. The Ad-Hoc Committee will reconvene on 5 December to give formal approval to the work of the Drafting Committee and the draft Convention will then be referred to the General Assembly. It is hoped to have the Convention adopted by the General Assembly during its current session.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">I welcome this significant progress towards the adoption of the Convention. Ireland will be supporting the adoption of the draft Convention when it comes before the General Assembly. Ireland, along with our EU partners, was an active participant in the meetings of the Ad-Hoc Committee. Ireland was represented at these meetings by officials from a number of Government Departments, including my own Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">Ireland also actively supported the participation of civil society in the drafting process. Ireland has funded participation at the Ad-Hoc Committee by Irish NGOs representing persons with disabilities and has emphasised the importance of maintaining the unprecedented level of NGO participation in the drafting process. Ireland has welcomed the progress made to date and looks forward to the early adoption by the General Assembly of what will be the first human rights convention of the 21st century.</p>

            <p eId="para_989">The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is an integral part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the principles and objectives of which are set out in the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties, approved by the people at successive referenda. The Union is continuing to develop its capabilities for crisis management operations, both military and civilian. The objectives which it has set itself are set out in the Headline Goal 2010 and the Civilian Headline Goal 2008. These include having the capability to undertake humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, along with conflict prevention and civilian crisis management.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">There are eleven ESDP crisis management missions currently underway, both civilian and military. The civilian missions include police and rule of law missions, security sector reform assistance, and border monitoring missions. The principal military mission has been the ongoing peace stabilisation mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina (EUFOR Althea).</p>
            <p eId="para_991">An EU Planning Team has been deployed to Kosovo this year to prepare for an expected rule of law mission in Kosovo next Spring, in succession to the current UN mission operating there. Current and future ESDP missions were reviewed by Foreign and Defence Ministers at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council earlier this month. Work has also been proceeding on the development of EU Battlegroups. Twenty-six nations — including Turkey and Norway — have committed to forming or joining these rapid response teams, which will reach full operational capability from 1 January next year. At its meeting on 14 November 2006, the Government decided that Ireland would provide a contingent of the Defence Forces to participate in the Nordic Battlegroup. This Battlegroup will be on standby in the first half of 2008. Deployment of the Irish contingent of the Battlegroup will of course remain subject to the requirements of the "triple lock" of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_996">I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 55, 107 and 108 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">Ireland will not open diplomatic relations with Burma until Aung San Suu Kyi is released from house arrest. The Government consistently takes a strong position on Burma on all possible occasions, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations. Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy in Burma. Ireland and our EU partners apply a range of sanctions and restrictive measures against Burma, referred to as the EU Common Position, which was renewed in April for a further year. In the absence of any significant progress in Burma, Ireland strongly supported the renewal.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">The exchange of non-resident Ambassadors was put on hold by Ireland in 2004. Significant and positive moves by the Government of Burma, including and in particular — as I have indicated above — the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, will be required before any decision to proceed with an exchange of Ambassadors can be made. There has not been any recent direct bilateral contact with the Government of Burma. However, at the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) Summit held in Helsinki in September, the Taoiseach raised the situation in Burma in the presence of the Burmese Foreign Minister and called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma attended as a member of ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations) and was the only participant at the Summit not invited at Head of State or Government level. The EU Troika met with the Foreign Minister in the margins of the Summit to reinforce the EU's strong concerns about the lack of progress in Burma. We raise the issue of Burma with our ASEAN partners at every appropriate opportunity and I welcome their increased efforts to put pressure on the Burmese régime.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">In my statement on behalf of Ireland to the 61st Session of the UN General Assembly on 26 September, I referred to the particularly grave human rights situation in Burma. I called, once again, on the Burmese régime to move towards democracy and to release all political prisoners, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi. These statements by the Taoiseach and myself are consistent with the strong position on Burma which Ireland takes on all possible occasions, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">The situation in Burma was most recently discussed at the EU General Affairs and External Council Meeting in Luxembourg on 12 June. Subsequently, the UN Security Council included Burma on its agenda on 29 September when it was briefed by UN Under-Secretary-General (UNUSG) Gambari, who had visited Burma in May. In a welcome development UNUSG Gambari paid a second visit to the country earlier this month. These visits were the first high-level visits to that country by a UN representative in more than two years. I welcome the fact that during his visits he was able to meet with the most senior Burmese leaders, as well as with Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of her party, the National League for Democracy. I strongly welcome the inclusion of Burma on the Security Council agenda. It is vitally important that the Burmese government allow the UN to play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy so that the resumed National Convention can proceed in a more inclusive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">I remain deeply concerned that Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained continuously for over three years without charge and, once more, urge the Burmese government to restore fully her freedom and civil liberties. On 27 May, the EU issued a statement which deeply regretted the decision of the Burmese government to extend the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and deplored the fact that international appeals, including that of the EU, had once again gone unheard.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1005">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 74 and 86 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">I know that the Deputies will join with me in condemning in the strongest possible terms the assassination on 21 November of the Lebanese Minister of Industry, Pierre Gemayel. As I stated at the time, the killing is an appalling tragedy for Mr. Gemayel's family, to whom we convey our deepest sympathy. It also appears to be a further challenge to the legitimate, democratically-elected Government of Lebanon. All parties in Lebanon and in the region now have a clear responsibility to act to stabilise the situation in the country and to focus on the work of reconstruction following the terrible conflict this summer. The Government and our EU partners are determined to maintain our support for the Lebanese people and their Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">Before the assassination of Pierre Gemayel, the Government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora was already under sustained pressure from Hezbollah, resulting in the resignation of a number of Ministers. Last week's meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels strongly encouraged all Lebanese parties to resume the process of national dialogue aimed at resolving the political crisis. It emphasised the EU's continuing support for the legitimate and democratically-elected Lebanese Government and its efforts to reconstruct and stabilise the country following the conflict. The Council called on all parties to comply with Security Council Resolution 1701, notably the arms embargo. It called on Israel to stop violations of Lebanese airspace by the Israeli Air Force, and on all countries in the region to refrain from any interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">Overall, the ceasefire in Lebanon has continued to hold well. The immediate cause of the conflict in July and August was the unprovoked attack by Hezbollah on Israeli territory, and the killing and capture of a number of Israeli soldiers. From the beginning, the Government called unambiguously for an immediate cessation of violence and the protection of civilian lives. We were particularly critical of the harsh and disproportionate military response by Israel, the very high level of civilian casualties and the widespread destruction of vital civilian infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">At the root of the conflict and the continuing political tensions in Lebanon is the absence of a credible process for a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. The unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1701 on 11 August provided the basis for the ceasefire, and it continues to offers a path to a stable peace, based on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon. The Government and our partners in the EU will remain actively engaged in support of its full implementation. The EU has taken the lead in ensuring that the deployment of the strengthened UNIFIIL force in Southern Lebanon, alongside units of the Lebanese Army, has proceeded smoothly and on schedule, and that the ceasefire has held. Building on the contribution of the Defence Forces to peacekeeping in Lebanon since 1978, Ireland is playing its part through the deployment since 31 October of a UNIFIL contingent, as part of a joint Finnish-Irish unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">I am aware of media reports that the Monitoring Group on Somalia which was established by the UN Security Council to monitor violations of the embargo on the provision of arms to Somalia is expected to transmit its latest regular report to the Council shortly. Among the reported findings are that Hezbollah has provided military training to the opposition Islamic Courts Union in Somalia, and that a Somali force of 720 militia members fought with Hezbollah in Lebanon during the recent conflict. The Government will examine the report when it is published. I understand that its findings will be considered by the Security Council in the coming weeks.</p>

Ireland signed the Optional Protocol on 7 September 2000.  The Optional Protocol entered into force on 18 January 2002, following its ratification by 10 states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">The Optional Protocol covers inter alia, the sexual exploitation of children, the transfer of organs of a child for profit, engagement of a child in forced labour and improperly inducing consent for the adoption of a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">Some legislative changes are required before Ireland can ratify this Optional Protocol.</p>

The provisions of the proposed legislation will bring Ireland into line with the requirements of the Optional Protocol in relation to the criminalisation of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">I understand from my colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State for Children, that their officials are reviewing the legislative changes required in the areas of adoption of children and sale of children's organs for profit, which would enable Ireland to move to ratify the Optional Protocol.</p>

            <p eId="para_1018">The announcement by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on 9 October that it had tested a nuclear explosive device was met with swift condemnation by members of the international community, including Ireland.  I strongly condemned this provocative act by the DPRK as a threat to regional security and as running counter to the objectives of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">On 14 October, in clear recognition of the gravity of the DPRK's decision, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1718.  This resolution obliged the international community to enforce specific sanctions, including an arms embargo, as well as a ban on any items which could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear, ballistic missile or Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">At a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 16 October, the EU committed itself to the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1718, as well as Resolution 1695, adopted in July in response to the DPRK's earlier controversial ballistic missile tests.  A Common Position imposing restrictive measures against DPRK in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1718 was adopted by the Council on 20 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">Specifically, the Common Position provides for a ban on exports of sensitive goods and technology which could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related or other weapons of mass destruction-related programmes, and on the provision of related services; a ban on procurement of sensitive goods and technology from the DPRK; as well as a ban on exports of luxury goods and the freezing of funds and economic resources of persons, entities and bodies engaged in or providing support for the said DPRK programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">This regulation will enable EU partners to implement sanctions through their domestic law in a coherent manner. Preparatory inter-Departmental and inter-agency consultations are currently underway here, with a view to the early implementation of the necessary national measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">Recent reports that the DPRK has pledged to return to the Six Party Talks shortly without preconditions are a welcome development and I would particularly congratulate China for its efforts in this regard.  This does not, however, mean that efforts to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 should weaken.</p>

            <p eId="para_1025">Ireland, along with our EU partners, continues to urge the Cuban authorities to bring about rapid, lasting and substantial improvements in ensuring the full respect for all human rights.  The European Union's 1996 Common Position is a central element in Ireland's relations with Cuba.  The General Affairs and External Relations Council, in its most recent evaluation of the Common Position in June 2006, expressed serious concern at the ongoing large-scale violation of human rights in Cuba.  In particular, the Council strongly condemned the trial and continuing detention of a large number of prisoners of conscience, including those arrested during a crackdown by the Cuban authorities in March and April 2003.  The Council called on Cuba to release immediately all those detained for political reasons.  The Council reiterated that constructive engagement remained the basis of EU policy towards Cuba, emphasising the importance which the Union attached to dialogue in order to produce tangible results.  The Council also expressed its continued preparedness to provide EU co-operation to Cuba in areas that promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Ireland fully concurred in the Council's consensus on these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">I would again urge the Cuban Government to release all prisoners of conscience and to respect internationally acknowledged principles and practices in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

         the information which he has with regard to the ongoing allegations of organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China; if he and Department officials have raised this matter, and the more general matter of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_387">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1028">As set out in previous PQ replies, most recently on 24 May, I am aware of allegations regarding the harvesting of live organs from Falun Gong practitioners, including as set out in a recent Canadian report by Mr David Matas and Mr David Kilgour on behalf of the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falun Gong in China (CIPFG). I view these allegations seriously and enquiries on this issue have been made by the Department within the EU and UN frameworks, as well as through our Embassy in Beijing.  Although our enquiries are continuing, no evidence has been found to date to support the allegations contained in the report.  However, I understand that one of the authors of the report, Mr David Kilgour, is in Ireland this week, and I have arranged for a senior official from my Department to meet with him to discuss the findings of the report.  Without prejudice to the outcome of the above enquiries, Ireland and the EU remain concerned about the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in China and have raised our concerns with the Chinese Government on many occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">I am also aware of reports of a trade in human organs in China generally.  The sale of organs for transplant is illegal in China.  The Chinese Government introduced a regulation in July to govern the clinical use of body parts as well as the transplantation of body parts.  Reports suggest, however, that an illegal trade in the organs of executed prisoners does exist.  Wherever this practice occurs, and whatever the circumstances, the illegal harvesting of, and trafficking in, human organs is a deplorable act.  This issue has been raised as part of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, most recently in October 2006.  The Chinese authorities state that they are firmly opposed to the illegal trade in human organs for transplant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">Human rights issues are a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union levels.  The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises human rights issues and concerns with China.  The latest round of the Dialogue was held in Beijing on 19 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">Senior officials from both sides discussed a wide range of human rights issues. Special attention was given to questions related to combating racism, freedom of expression and reform of the criminal justice system in China.  The EU took note of the commitment of China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as soon as possible and, in that context, to reform its criminal justice system.  The EU urged China to continue cooperation with, and implementation of the recommendations of, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, including the rapid abolition of the "re-education through labour" system.  The EU expressed its deep concern over the continuing restrictions on freedom of expression in China, including on the use of the internet.  The EU further expressed concern at the high number of human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists in prison and urged China not to harass or punish individuals exercising their right to freedom of expression in a peaceful manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">On a bilateral level, I met with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing on 12 May during a visit to Beijing.  During the meeting, I had the opportunity to raise human rights issues and concerns, including the importance we attach to freedom of speech and freedom of religion.  Chinese Foreign Minister Li referred in particular to China's commitment to the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue and was hopeful that a decision would be taken to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as soon as possible.  Most recently, the Tánaiste held official talks on 25 September with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Zeng Peiyan in the course of which he also raised human rights issues and concerns.</p>

            <p eId="para_1034">As I advised the House in reply to a similar question on the 25th October, fifteen Member States have so far ratified the Constitutional Treaty.  Luxembourg and Spain have done so by referendum while thirteen Member States have ratified by parliamentary means.  Finland is expected to complete its ratification procedures in the coming months.  As the House is aware, the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums held in France and the Netherlands last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">Following the referendum results in France and the Netherlands, the European Council initiated a period of reflection in order to allow time for further consideration of how to proceed with the Constitutional Treaty.  In June 2006, the European Council agreed to extend the reflection period for another year and to focus also on the Union's delivery of tangible results to EU citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">The European Council also mandated the Presidency to consult extensively with Member States and to present a report to the European Council in June 2007.  That report is to contain an assessment of the state of discussions with regard to the Constitutional Treaty and to explore possible future developments.  The report is intended to allow the European Council to point the way forward towards decisions on the Constitutional Treaty, which are expected to be taken during the second half of 2008 at the latest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">As I stated earlier, Ireland's view remains that the Constitutional Treaty is a carefully constructed package and remains the best available option for equipping the Union with the means to meet the challenges facing us now and into the future.  For this reason, we believe that any attempt to alter the essential balance and substance of the draft Treaty would be unlikely to succeed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 60, 92, 113 and 116 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The St. Andrews Agreement published by the two Governments on 13 October underpins the Good Friday Agreement and sets out a clear way forward for all parties to commit to the full operation of stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and to full support for policing and the criminal justice institutions, including the Policing Board.  It also sets out in some detail the practical changes proposed to the operation of the institutions, the arrangements for a financial package and the timetable for implementation of the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">At St. Andrews, the Governments asked the parties, having consulted their members, to confirm acceptance of the agreement by 10 November.  Further to these consultations and their contacts with the parties, the Governments announced on 10 November that they were satisfied that the St. Andrews Agreement, implemented in good faith, represents the basis for a political settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">Last week therefore, the British Government published draft legislation to give effect to the St. Andrews Agreement.  This legislation yesterday completed its passage through the Westminster parliament.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">The legislation makes the necessary provisions to allow devolved government to be restored in Northern Ireland on the basis of the timetable set out at St. Andrews, which envisages restoration of the devolved institutions on 26 March 2007.  It provides for a Transitional Assembly to meet from 24 November to prepare for restoration of the devolved institutions.  It includes amendments to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to implement, on restoration, the practical changes to the operation of the institutions agreed at St. Andrews.  It also includes provision for the Northern Ireland Assembly to be dissolved at any time before 25 March 2007 if it is considered there is no reasonable prospect of establishing a power-sharing government.  In these circumstances, the Governments would move immediately to implement new British Irish partnership arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">It was clear from our discussions with the parties at St. Andrews that some form of electoral endorsement of the agreement as a whole would be required before the formation of an Executive next March.  The British legislation makes provision for this to be by way of elections to the Assembly in Northern Ireland on 7 March 2007.  The Secretary of State Peter Hain has made clear however that an election would only take place in these circumstances, that is if it is clear that the parties are working constructively towards participation in a power-sharing Executive by 26 March of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">As to whether a referendum is required here, the Attorney General will advise the Government on any implications that may arise in this jurisdiction, once he has completed his examination of the final content of the British legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">In the course of our ongoing efforts to restore devolved Government to Northern Ireland, all parties have raised with us issues of particular concern to their membership. In our contacts with the parties we have consistently sought to address these issues as constructively as possible, and in line with our overall aim of achieving full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Governments believe the St. Andrews Agreement addresses the concerns expressed by the parties, including the DUP, in a balanced and fair way.  We are satisfied that if it is implemented in good faith by the parties, it will clear the way for the restoration of the devolved institutions on 26 March 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">I was encouraged that the Programme for Government Committee met for the first time this week and that it has now begun to address some of the practical issues that will face the restored Executive.  We expect these preparations to intensify from tomorrow, once the Transitional Assembly gets down to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">The St. Andrews process will continue to require careful management over the coming weeks and months to bring it to a successful completion.  In that regard, there is a responsibility on all to play their part in making it work.  The Government will continue to work in close partnership with the British Government, as well as with the parties to complete this task and clear the way for a new era for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1055">I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 200 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The humanitarian situation across West Africa remains a matter of the deepest concern.  A number of countries, such as Sierra Leone and Liberia, are only now emerging from a bitter and destructive civil war, while conflict persists in some other states in the region such as the Ivory Coast.  At the same time, the countries of the Sahel, specifically Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Niger, continue to exhibit extreme vulnerability due to climactic changes and desertification.  The situation of the most vulnerable in these societies is of the utmost concern — a concern voiced forcefully by the United Nations earlier this year, which highlighted the fact that it is those most vulnerable sections of the community, notably women and children, which have borne the brunt of both the natural and man-made disasters which have afflicted the region in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">Ireland provides emergency and recovery funding in response to humanitarian needs across the region:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1058">Since 2005, Ireland has had a development cooperation office in Freetown which oversees programmes in Sierra Leone and in neighbouring Liberia.  This year, funding of over €6.8 million has been provided to assist in the recovery process in both countries;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1059">In the Sahel region, funding assistance of €7 million has been allocated for humanitarian assistance in 2006;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1060">Ireland's funding partnership programme with the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) provided funding of €1.5 million in 2006 and 2007, which is being partly utilised to help National Red Cross Societies in West Africa build local capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">Last year, the food crisis in Niger and surrounding countries highlighted a weakness in the system of international humanitarian response.  Once the food security situation emerged, Ireland responded in a prompt and timely manner with support of €3 million to Niger and Burkina Faso as the most seriously-affected countries.  Fortunately, the situation was quickly addressed and alleviated.  In addition, a subsequent healthy harvest eased the most immediate needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">The situation in Niger in 2005 helped to highlight the case for an enhanced international capacity to respond better to such crises.  One result of this was the strengthening of the United Nation's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).  This fund now enables the UN to have immediate access to grant-based stand-by funding, thereby speeding response to rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situations.  Ireland has contributed €10 million to the CERF in 2006 and we will double our funding in 2007, with a pledge of a further €20 million for 2007 at the forthcoming pledging conference in New York.  I will travel to New York on that occasion for discussions with the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland, to review global responses to situations like that in the Sahel region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">I can assure the Deputy that this region remains of concern for Ireland and we are committed to ensuring that the vulnerable populations there receive the humanitarian assistance which they require, in a timely and effective manner.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_392">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1070">I am aware of the strong historical and cultural links between Ireland and the island of Montserrat.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">In 1997, a major volcanic eruption affected the British Territory of Montserrat causing the evacuation of the population to neighbouring islands, or to the safer northern part of the island.  Due to the existing damage and the ongoing threat of further eruptions, the southern part of the island has been declared unfit for habitation, which has forced more than half of the population to leave the island owing to a lack of housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">The British Government has funded a substantial development effort in Montserrat. Apart from the basic needs of housing and sanitation, advances have been made in restoring health and educational services.  Efforts to rehabilitate the island are aimed primarily at the restoration of the country's economic infrastructure.  Redevelopment has focused on the northern third of the island, which is at negligible risk from the volcano.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">As Montserrat is a British territory, the UK Department of International Development has taken a lead role in the provision of assistance to Montserrat and has provided funding of some £220 million for both development assistance and budgetary support since 1997.  The population of the island now stands at approximately 5,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">In 2001, a Montserrat delegation including the Chief Minister of Montserrat, Mr. David S. Brandt, visited Ireland and met with officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the National Software Directorate and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  The focus of the Montserrat authorities was on rebuilding the tourism sector to reinvigorate the economy and to create greater employment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">In 2001, over €190,000 was allocated from Irish Aid to the authorities in Montserrat for assistance in the development of a National Tourism Strategy Document for the island.  This support is an expression of the strong historical links that Ireland has with Montserrat. Since then, confidence has been restored in this sector.  A particularly notable development has been the opening of a new airport in 2005 at Montserrat's new capital, Little Bay.  This marks an important milestone in the economic regeneration of the island.</p>

         the steps he is taking to promote access to medicine in the third world; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1079">Improving access to medicine is one of the critical challenges to improving health in the developing world. Many poor people do not have access to essential medicines due to a range of factors, including lack of drugs at health facilities, lack of trained staff to provide treatment and the high cost of medicine to poor people. Lack of access to medicine causes the deaths of many people each year in developing countries, particularly from HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and infectious diseases in children. Access to medicine needs to be improved along with complementary measures for prevention and care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">The Government's commitment to health and tackling HIV/AIDS and communicable diseases is set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid. We are committed to developing programmes that address the key causes of illness and poor health among the poorest and most vulnerable people and to strengthening health systems in the poorest countries. Providing access to essential medicines is a key part of this response. The area of greatest need for medicine is for treatment of communicable diseases and the Government has committed €100 million annually to tackling HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">In Irish Aid priority countries, the approach taken is to strengthen health systems so that everyone can have access to essential services, including treatment of diseases. Measures supported by Irish Aid funding include the development of better drug purchase and supply systems, and increased availability of skilled health workers to treat sick people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">A specific objective of the Government's partnership with the Clinton Foundation is to improve access to treatment for HIV/AIDS. The Government has committed €70 million from 2006-2010 to improving HIV services. Irish Aid is working with the Governments in Mozambique and Lesotho to make anti-retroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS available to all who need it. Success has been demonstrated in Mozambique where the Government of Mozambique has successfully introduced HIV treatment and at the end of June, over 27,000 people were on treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">One of the challenges in access to medicine is that drugs widely used in developing countries have become less effective. TB causes two million deaths a year, mainly in poor countries, yet there has been no major new TB drug developed for over 30 years. In 2006, the Government made a substantial investment in research and development for new drugs for TB and malaria. Irish Aid committed €9 million over three years both to the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development and the Medicine for Malaria Venture. These organisations offer the prospect of creating access to new and more effective drugs to developing counties within the next few years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">As outlined in the White Paper on Irish Aid, the issue of health remains a priority for our aid programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">As I have made clear on many occasions, the Government is completely opposed to the practice of so-called extraordinary rendition. Our position in this regard is regularly discussed with the US authorities. Most recently, I had the occasion to discuss the matter with the new US Ambassador, when we met at the beginning of this month. I am satisfied that the assurances we have received from the US authorities, that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission, remain valid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">Within the EU, the matter continues to be discussed by the Working Group on Public International Law, COJUR. At political level, the subject was discussed most recently by Ministers over lunch at the GAERC on 15 September. Ministers reiterated the EU's commitment to combating terrorism effectively, using all legal means and instruments available, while ensuring that in so doing, human rights and humanitarian standards are maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">In September, my Spanish colleague, Miguel Angel Moratinos, accepted an invitation to appear before the European Parliament's Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners. As the House will be aware, I have accepted a similar invitation, and I will be meeting with the Temporary Committee in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">Separately, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe continues to consider proposals made in this area by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr Terry Davis, on foot of his earlier enquiries. The Secretary General's proposed measures include drawing up minimum standards to prevent human rights abuses by security services, in particular foreign security services active on the territory of a Council of Europe member state, mechanisms to enforce existing human rights obligations with respect to transiting aircraft, and a legal instrument permitting diplomatic immunity to be waived in cases of serious human rights violations. In early September, the Committee of Ministers took note of the Secretary General's proposals and agreed to resume consideration of them at one of its forthcoming meetings. Ireland has welcomed the Secretary General's initiative and looks forward to further detailed discussion of them.</p>

Although some of the details remain unclear, we have followed it in coordination with the Missions of our EU partners in Tripoli, and will continue to do so. The person concerned has been detained for over two years. The Libyan authorities have stated that he has been charged with certain offences but the exact details have not been made known. The death penalty can be applied to some offences under the Articles of the Criminal Code which are involved, but it is not clear that this would necessarily apply in the case in question. A verdict and sentence have not yet been delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">The Deputy will be aware that this case has been followed closely by a number of NGOs, including Human Rights Watch, which has reported that the charges may relate to criticism of the Libyan leader and to contact with foreign authorities, possibly including a U.S. diplomat. I understand that the case is being pursued in particular by the authorities of the United States, where a number of relatives of the person involved are believed to live. He was released from detention on a previous occasion following intervention from the United States. There has been a significant improvement in relations between Libya and the US in recent years, although full diplomatic relations have yet to be re-established.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">Since 2003, Libya has taken important steps in order to normalise relations with the international community. Relations with the EU have also improved significantly. The EU recognises the positive developments in the human rights situation in the country, but continues to monitor the situation closely and to highlight issues of ongoing concern.</p>

            <p eId="para_1103">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 211 and 212 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">Negotiations regarding Turkish accession to the European Union commenced on 3 October 2005. An extensive screening process is currently ongoing which closely scrutinises the compatibility of Turkish legislation with that of the EU. In all, there are 35 negotiating chapters in the accession process. After a Chapter has been screened, the EU can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether the negotiations in that sector can proceed. In June 2006, the European Council welcomed the provisional closure of the Science and Research chapter with Turkey. To date, this is the only Chapter to have been provisionally concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The European Commission published its annual enlargement package on 8 November 2006. In its assessment of Turkey's progress, the Commission states that reforms have continued but have slowed during the past year. Improvements are needed on freedom of expression, the rights of non-Muslim religious communities, women's rights, trade union rights and on civilian control of the military. Further progress in aligning its legislation with that of the Union is also required in a range of areas, among them agriculture; taxation; state aid; and the free movement of goods, workers and capital. The Commission also calls on Turkey to ensure full implementation of the Ankara Protocol and states that it will make relevant recommendations ahead of the December European Council if Turkey has not fulfilled its obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">It is difficult to prioritise particular issues, as all of the points identified in the Commission report require Turkey's active attention. However, it is clear that Turkey's non-implementation of the Ankara Protocol is complicating the accession negotiations and requires an immediate solution. Resolution of the problem would facilitate progress in the negotiations and enable the EU to continue to press Turkey to sustain and accelerate its reform process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">The Finnish Presidency is currently working on an initiative aimed at resolving the question of access to Turkish ports for Cypriot vessels in compliance with the Ankara Protocol. Ireland is supportive of these efforts and we hope that an agreement can be reached in the coming weeks. When I met with the Turkish Chief Negotiator, Mr. Ali Babacan, at the beginning of the month, I impressed upon him the importance we attach to the resolution of this issue so as to prevent the accession negotiations from being adversely affected.</p>

            <p eId="para_1110">The preliminary report of the European Union Election Observation Mission found that the presidential elections had been adequately administered in a peaceful, competitive and transparent manner. Ireland provided assistance in the monitoring of these elections, with four Irish short-term observers taking part in the European Union Election Observation Mission and two Irish short-term observers assisting the monitoring mission carried out by the Carter Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">In 2005, Irish Aid allocated a total sum of €961,894 to development in Nicaragua under a number of civil society funding mechanisms. In cooperation with the Nicaraguan Ministry of External Relations Cooperation Secretariat, Irish Aid provided a total of €495,766 to the Capacity Building Programme for Civil Society Organisations in Nicaragua. This programme included a number of poverty reduction initiatives, among which were the promotion of fair trade access to international and national markets for small producers, funding of a mother and child health care programme aimed at reducing infant and maternal mortality, support for traditional health care facilities, management training programmes, and programmes focused on advocacy for national development and poverty reduction initiatives. In addition, Irish Aid provided a total of €154,292 to local NGOs under the Personnel Co-Financing and Partnership Fund, and allocated €311,836 from the Multi-Annual Programme Scheme in support of Trócaire's civil society and livelihood security initiatives in Nicaragua. Further funding for Nicaragua is currently under review in accordance with the commitments made in the White Paper on Irish Aid.</p>

            <p eId="para_1114">I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 100 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">The Government's objective is the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the restoration of the institutions, including the North/South Ministerial Council. In the St Andrews Agreement we have set out a clear path to restoration by 26 March 2007. This will greatly enhance the excellent work being undertaken by the North/South Bodies, as well as facilitating the development of North/South co-operation to the benefit of all.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">A key priority for the Government is to give enhanced impetus to North/South co-operation, including through all-island economic co-operation. On 26 October, the Secretary of State and I launched a ground-breaking Study on the All-island Economy. The study sets out a strong and cogent economic rationale for economic co-operation on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">Initiatives identified in the Study embrace further collaboration in Research and Development, including maximising access to EU funds; a new targeted approach to enterprise training and to identifying labour market needs on an all-island basis. We have also agreed to pool our resources in trade promotion, including the opening up of trade missions to businesses across the island and the placing of the overseas offices of Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI at the disposal of companies, North and South. Already trade missions to India and Canada have included companies from both parts of the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">The Study identified co-operation on the planning and delivery of infrastructure as key to maximising returns on the major infrastructure investments being made, North and South, and also to help ensure more balanced regional development. In this regard, the all-island dimension will be an important horizontal theme of the Government's next National Development Plan for the period 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">The Governments are committed to working together to create a more integrated and regionally-balanced road network, enhancing key routes between the major urban centres on the island. In addition the Government is moving ahead to re-open the remaining few cross border routes closed as a result of the Troubles. I should add that some significant progress has already been achieved, for example in the upgrading of the Dublin Belfast road and the agreement to joint investment in the development of the City of Derry Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">The Government is also committed to taking forward plans for the restoration of the Ulster Canal to create a further major inland waterway for the border region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">In the energy sector, the Single Electricity Market will be operational in 2007 and plans are advanced for the development of further interconnection of our electricity and gas supply systems on a North/South and East/West basis. The two Governments have agreed to work together to maximise the contribution of renewable and sustainable energy to the future energy needs of the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">The Government's vision is of a strong, competitive and socially inclusive island economy which will deliver better results and better outcomes for people, North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">The two Governments, along with key stakeholders, will now jointly develop a more detailed programme of work in each of the areas identified in the Study as well as seeking further opportunities for co-operation in the education and health sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Recognising the significant practical benefits of all-island economic collaboration, I look forward to working on this important agenda with a restored Northern Ireland Executive and North/South Ministerial Council in the near future.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1128">I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 106 and 209 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">In any country, developing the democratic structures, institutions and administrative systems necessary to provide essential public services and to ensure a secure environment for all its people is a process that takes time. I believe that this is an important period for Afghanistan in consolidating the progress that has been made. It is important that we, the international community, do not allow Afghanistan to fail. Within the EU, discussions are currently taking place on possible further EU support for the rule of law sector in Afghanistan. The EU will continue to explore ways in which it can improve its effectiveness in supporting the Government and other actors to continue to seek to improve the situation in the country. We continue to encourage the Afghan government to take all necessary steps in addressing serious issues relating to impunity and corruption, as well as expanding legitimate government control and human security through the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">The Afghan Parliament has now voted in the remaining Cabinet and Supreme Court members, and has started to review the country's current legislation. The appointment of a new, reform-minded Supreme Court is a positive development, as has been the work of officials, including the new Attorney General, in tackling corruption. The reform process is continuing with the assistance of the international community across all sectors, including the administrative and judicial systems, the police service and army.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">The Afghanistan Compact, launched at the International Conference on Afghanistan in London on 31 January/1 February, and endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1659 (2006), continues to guide the joint efforts of the Afghan Government and the international community in meeting outstanding challenges across three pillars of activity: security; governance, rule of law and human rights; and economic and social development. Ireland pledged €5 million at the launch of the Compact, which will be expended over the next two years. Ireland has contributed a total of €22 million to reconstruction and recovery programmes in Afghanistan since January 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">Ensuring security in Afghanistan is an especially challenging and complex task, particularly given the presence of violent factions who stand to benefit considerably from a destabilised country. Though the past five months have witnessed an increase in fighting in the south and insurgency-related security incidents in the capital, there has been a marked decrease in both since the beginning of November. The recent success of ‘Operation Medusa' in the south, involving the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) , has delivered a blow to Taliban military capabilities. At the same time, the continuing challenge from the Taliban is worrying, and the security situation remains a cause of serious concern. Long-term success will depend on significant improvements in governance and prompt delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">The illicit narcotics industry also remains a major challenge to the long-term security, development and effective governance of Afghanistan. In cooperation with the international community, the Afghan Government operates a Counter Narcotics Implementation Plan and a National Drugs Control Strategy in an effort to work towards elimination of the narcotics trade. Reported statistics for the 2005-2006 opium crop are disappointing. Though eradication rose by 210%, production is believed to have still increased significantly. Counter narcotics efforts were identified as a cross-cutting priority in the Afghan Compact and will be a particularly important challenge in the period ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">ISAF, under NATO leadership, deployed to the eastern part of Afghanistan in October, hitherto the exclusive domain of the ANA and the US-led international coalition, Operation Enduring Freedom. This means that ISAF is now responsible for security assistance throughout the whole country. Seven members of the Irish Defence Forces currently serve in ISAF, based in Kabul.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">ISAF is a UN Chapter VII operation, originally mandated by Security Council Resolution 1386 of 20 December 2001, and extended in September last by Security Council Resolution 1707. Its present mandate runs to October 2007. It is composed of contingents from both NATO and other contributing countries and, as indicated, is deployed under the authorisation of the UN Security Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">ISAF's mandate is for the maintenance of security in support of the Afghan Transitional Authority — which has since been succeeded by the Government of Afghanistan. The mandate authorises ISAF "to support the Afghan Transitional Authority and its successors in the maintenance of security in areas of Afghanistan outside of Kabul and its environs, so that the Afghan Authorities as well as the personnel of the United Nations and other international civilian personnel engaged, in particular, in reconstruction and humanitarian efforts, can operate in a secure environment, and to provide security assistance for the performance of other tasks in support of the Bonn agreement."</p>

            <p eId="para_1138">The Government has decided, in line with the recommendation in the White Paper on Irish Aid, to establish a Task Force on Hunger. The aim of the Task Force will be to identify the additional, appropriate and effective contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger and thus achieve the first Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty and hunger by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">Consultations are currently underway on the likely composition and programme of work of the Task Force.

            <p eId="para_1140">In terms of substance, it is envisaged that the Task Force will build on the valuable work on hunger of the UN Millennium Project "Halving hunger: it can be done" and will:</p>

            <p eId="para_1146">Human rights issues are a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union levels. At EU level, the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns with China about individual human rights cases, and more general issues such as freedom of expression and the abolition of the death penalty. These issues were raised at the latest round of the Dialogue in Beijing on 19 October 2006. At the meeting, the EU raised cases relating to Tibetan individuals in its list of individual cases of concern submitted to the Chinese authorities, a procedure which forms part of the Dialogue process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">At this meeting also, the EU specifically raised the issue of shooting of Tibetan refugees at the Nanga La Pass on the Tibet-Nepal border on 30 September, expressing our deep concern about these events and urging China to investigate the incident thoroughly. We continue to have serious concerns about the official Chinese explanation of the event, which does not appear compatible with the testimony of independent eyewitnesses or video footage of the event.  I believe it is important that China seek to establish and address the full facts of the incident.  Ireland, with our EU partners, will continue to follow up the matter closely with the Chinese authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, and, in line with our ‘One China' policy and the position of all other EU partners, recognises Tibet as an integral part of China.  His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, in his ‘middle-way-approach', while seeking greater autonomy for Tibet, also accepts that it is part of the People's Republic of China and stresses that the solution he seeks for the people of Tibet is one ‘within the framework of the Chinese constitution'.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">Ireland, together with our EU partners, strongly supports the dialogue between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama that has been taking place since 2002, the last meeting having taken place in February this year.  We would very much encourage the dialogue between the two sides to continue, leading to a peaceful and sustainable solution for Tibet.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">The Government has consistently called on the Chinese authorities to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people, including their socioeconomic and human rights.  We will continue to address our ongoing concerns regarding Tibet, both bilaterally and within the framework of the EU-China dialogue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">On a bilateral level, I met with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing on 12 May during my recent visit to Beijing.  During our meeting, I had the opportunity to raise human rights issues and concerns, including the importance we attach to freedom of speech and freedom of religion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1157">The Deputy will recall that in May 2005 several hundred people died during demonstrations in the town of Andijan in Uzbekistan. As a result of the Uzbek authorities' refusal to allow an independent international enquiry into the events there, and in light of the excessive and indiscriminate use of force by the Uzbek security forces during those events, the EU imposed a series of measures on Uzbekistan on October 2005. These included an embargo on arms exports, a visa ban on named officials involved in the events at Andijan and its aftermath, and a suspension of technical meetings of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which is the framework governing the EU's relations with Uzbekistan. However, diplomatic ties were not broken off.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">Contacts with the Uzbek authorities in recent weeks indicated that they may now be willing to begin to address the EU's concerns. At a Cooperation Council on 8 November, Uzbekistan offered to host a meeting (before the end of the year) of EU and Uzbek experts to discuss the Andijan events. They also proposed that the EU and Uzbekistan open a regular dialogue on human rights. While the EU remains profoundly concerned about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, it considers that the opening to dialogue on the side of Uzbekistan offers the opportunity to bring Uzbekistan into compliance with the principles of respect for human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms. The EU has therefore agreed to resume the technical meetings of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. The arms embargo and visa ban remain in force and will be reviewed again in 3 months in light of developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">The visit of President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to Brussels should be seen in the context of the EU's growing relationship with Central Asia. One of the priorities of the Germany Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2007 will be to launch an EU strategy for Central Asia, having regard to the rising importance of the region. This stems from a recognition of the strategic location of Central Asia as a cross-roads between Europe and Asia, its importance as an energy provider for Europe and the EU's desire to help the countries of the region in their ongoing development.  Discussion of the new approach to Central Asia within the EU is still at an early stage and Ireland is contributing to this process. Visits such as those of the President of Kazakhstan, and the increasing tempo of high level EU delegations visiting the region generally should help to ensure that the EU has an adequate understanding of conditions and needs in the region, on which to base its new strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">The visit of President Aliyev of Azerbaijan to Brussels in November came just before the signing of European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans by the three South Caucasus countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) on 14 November. These set out the reform and development aims of the three countries and indicate the assistance the EU will provide to these countries over the next 5 years. As with Central Asia, the EU is becoming increasingly engaged with the South Caucasus region and the signing of Action Plans with the three countries represents a significant stepping up of the EU's activities there. While in Brussels President Aliyev met with Commission President Barroso and signed a Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation with the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_1163">These Conventions were superseded by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea adopted on 10 December 1982, which was signed by Ireland on that date and ratified on 21 June 1996. This Convention resolved a number of crucial issues which were unresolved under its 1958 predecessors and is universally regarded as a comprehensive constitution for the governance of oceans and seas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1170">The November General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) meeting included a Joint Session of Foreign and Defence Ministers.  Ireland was represented by my colleagues, Noel Treacy, T.D., Minister for European Affairs and Tom Kitt, T.D. Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  The Vice President of the European Commission, Commissioner Margot Wallström, presented the main elements of the Commission's work programme for 2007.  The programme focuses on four priority areas:continuing to build prosperity under the Lisbon Strategy; developing social solidarity; protecting Europeans against the threat of crime, terrorism, communicable diseases; developing a strong EU voice in the world.  The Presidency introduced the annotated draft agenda for the European Council to be held in Brussels on 14/15 December 2006.  The issues to be addressed by the European Council are Enlargement; Justice and Home Affairs; Innovation and Energy; and External Relations.  The GAERC will finalise the European Council agenda at its December meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171">Ministers received a briefing from Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the future status process for Kosovo, and held a discussion on EU policy towards Kosovo.  Also on the Western Balkans, the Council adopted negotiation mandates for visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.  A negotiation mandate was adopted for a visa facilitation agreement with Albania (with which the EU already has a readmission agreement).  The Council discussed EU relations with Russia and considered, but did not conclude, draft negotiating Directives for a new Agreement to provide a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations.  As regards relations with Uzbekistan, the Council decided to extend the arms embargo and visa restriction imposed in connection with the events at Andijan in May 2005.  It decided to reinstate technical meetings with Uzbekistan with the aim of bringing about improvements in the human rights situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">At a Joint Session for Ministers of Defence and Foreign Affairs, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Michel provided a positive assessment of the political situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, following the second and final round of parliamentary elections in that country.  Ministers also discussed Afghanistan, and the possibility for an enhanced EU contribution to international efforts to stabilise the political and security situation there.  Finally, the Joint Session reviewed developments in the European Security and Defence Policy over the last six months, noting <i>inter alia</i> the activity report of the Head of the European Defence Agency, and the outcome of the Civilian Capabilities Improvement Conference held in the margins of the Council.  Over lunch, the Council discussed Enlargement, Middle East Peace Process and Iran.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">The Commission summarised its recent Communication on Enlargement which included an individual assessment of all candidate and potential candidate countries as well as an overall enlargement strategy paper.  The Commission's strategy paper will form the basis of a comprehensive debate on all aspects of enlargement, due to take place at the December European Council.  As expected, substantive discussion on the strategy paper did not take place at last week's GAERC.  On Turkey, whose failure to implement the Ankara Protocol has given rise to difficulties in the accession negotiations, the Commission stated that it would bring forward its recommendations ahead of the December GAERC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">On the Middle East, Ministers reviewed recent political and security developments in Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Lebanon, and discussed the prospects for a Government of national unity in Palestine.  The Council decided to extend the EU Border Assistance Mission for the Rafah Crossing Point for a further six months.  On Iran, High Representative Javier Solana informed Ministers that little progress had been made up to that point in discussion at the UN Security Council on a draft Resolution on the Iranian nuclear issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1176">The Taoiseach recently sent a letter of congratulations to President Lula da Silva on the occasion of his re-election as President of the Federative Republic of Brazil.  The Taoiseach wished President Lula well in his second term in office and expressed his wish to develop further the warm and close relations between Ireland and Brazil.  Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, Ireland and Brazil have enjoyed positive and deepening relations, with continuing efforts being made through the Embassy of Ireland in Brasilia to further strengthen bilateral ties.  Over the last five years, a number of state, official and high-level visits have been made to Brazil, notably an official visit to Brazil by the Taoiseach in July 2001 and a state visit by President McAleese in March 2004.  In the economic domain, an Enterprise Ireland delegation visited Brazil in February 2006.  Enterprise Ireland has appointed a consultant in Sao Paolo to assist Irish companies interested in entering the Brazilian market, with a number of Irish businesses attending a Telecommunications Trade Fair in Florianópolis in October 2006.  A visit to Ireland in March 2006 by the Chief Executive of the Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development, Mr. Alessandro Teixeira, was followed by a visit by the Brazilian Minister for Industry, Trade and Development, Mr. Luiz Fernando Furlan, in May 2006.  Ireland also engages in dialogue with Brazil in the context of membership of the European Union.  EU relations with Brazil are pursued through bilateral and multilateral fora, the former being based on the 1992 EC-Brazil Framework Cooperation Agreement and the latter being conducted through the mechanism of the 1995 EU-Mercosur Framework Cooperation Agreement.  Ireland and Brazil co-operate on a range of multilateral issues at the UN, and in the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty as members of the New Agenda Coalition.  Political consultations were held at senior official level in Dublin in April this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1178">Accession negotiations were opened with Croatia on 3 October 2005.  The screening process, which scrutinises the compatibility of Croatian legislation with EU legislation, has continued during the Finnish Presidency but progress has been quite slow in comparison with previous enlargement rounds.  After each chapter has been screened, the EU can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether the negotiations in that sector can be opened.  Croatia has opened and provisionally closed negotiations on just one chapter (Science and Research).  To date, the Commission has presented its reports to the Council on 15 further negotiating chapters for Croatia.  Benchmarks, which must be achieved before negotiations may be opened, have been agreed for 7 of the 15 chapters for Croatia.  It is expected that Croatia will be invited to open negotiations on a number of chapters shortly.  At this stage, it is not possible to set a timeframe for the completion of the negotiations with Croatia.  They will be judged on their own merits and the pace of the negotiations will be determined by progress in fulfilling the requirements of membership.  The European Commission published its annual enlargement package on 8 November 2006.  The package includes an individual assessment of the progress made by all of the candidate and potential candidate countries as well as an overall enlargement strategy paper.  The Commission report commends the good start Croatia has made to its accession negotiations.  The report also noted that Croatia needs to accelerate the pace of reforms in order to ensure that its good start to the accession process is maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_1181">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 208 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">Programmes and projects supported by Irish Aid are subject to detailed planning and preparation to ensure they are designed to meet the needs of the poor.  Poverty reduction is at the heart of the aid programme and this focus has been endorsed by the White Paper on Irish Aid, published in September.  Irish Aid constantly monitors and evaluates the implementation and outcome of its interventions, either directly with development partners including governments, non-governmental organisations and civil society, or in co-operation with other donors and international organisations, so that its effectiveness can be measured against defined objectives and against the broad aim of contributing to sustainable poverty reduction.  If there is evidence of misuse of funds, it is investigated thoroughly and appropriate remedial and preventive measures are put in place.  Aid is delivered in some of the most difficult operating environments in the world, where the strength of systems and capacities of our partners, both governmental and civil society, are not well developed.  The challenge for our programme is not only to reduce poverty but at the same time to build capacity across a range of institutions in developing countries.  Good governance is a key objective of the programme, one of the main aims of which is to build effective systems of service delivery and to identify and remedy misuse of funds and weak administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">The highest importance is attached to the Audit and Evaluation functions in the Irish Aid programme.  Rigorous accounting and control systems are in place to protect Irish funding from misuse.  Irish Aid organises audits through its Audit and Evaluation Unit and in conjunction with reputable international firms.  Over the history of the programme, the attention and resources devoted to Audit and Evaluation has greatly increased.  In 2003, an independent Audit Committee was established.  Formal audit and evaluation systems have been designed and implemented including the overseas office audit policy, value for money study guidelines and the Audit Charter.  Internal auditors are in place in 5 Programme Countries and additional auditors will be recruited as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">Ireland's overseas development assistance is effective.  The development programme has been favourably reviewed by the OECD.  Working in over ninety countries, and with a particular emphasis on Africa, Irish Aid is helping people to improve their own lives and is making a real difference on the ground.  For instance, in Lesotho in 1999, enrolment in primary schools was at 57%.  With Ireland's support, by 2003, this figure had increased to 82%. With Ireland's support, immunisation rates against childhood diseases in Uganda are now at 84% for the entire country.  More generally, it is clear that development assistance is having a positive effect in Africa.  In its Africa Development — Indicators 2006 Report, the World Bank notes that in contrast with the 1990s, conflicts in Africa have declined and economic performance has improved.  It notes also that since the second half of the 1990s, many low income African countries including Mozambique and Uganda have lifted significant percentages of their citizens above the poverty line.</p>

            <p eId="para_1188">This year Irish Aid has delivered significant development and humanitarian funding in the Middle East.  The bulk of Ireland's assistance this year — over €8.5 million — has been allocated to Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq.  Depending on the emergency and development needs of the region, I expect that our assistance would remain at a similar level in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">Palestine remains our key partner in the region.  Ireland has been providing development and humanitarian assistance in support of the Palestinian people since 1993.  In 2006, we allocated €6.4 million to meet the humanitarian and development needs of the Palestinian people.  Ireland's core objective in providing assistance to Palestine is to alleviate the consequences of the conflict by enhancing the capacity of Ireland's partners in Palestine to respond to the current crisis and, where possible, to begin to meet future development needs.  The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs remain key partners for Ireland in the provision of basic, emergency assistance to the Palestinian people.  Ireland has provided €3 million in assistance to UNRWA this year.  This core funding facilitates UNRWA in responding with flexibility to Palestinian needs in the West Bank, Gaza and also in the region, including refugees in Jordan, Syria and the Lebanon.  In 2007, Irish Aid is set to continue to provide a similar level of assistance to the Palestinian people and our focus will continue to be on the three sectors of education; rural development and support for civil society.  Our funding of these sectors will be complemented by our continuing commitment to the funding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">Ireland responded swiftly to the crisis in Lebanon earlier this year.  On 31 August, at the Stockholm Donor Conference, I pledged a further €2 million for recovery and longer-term reconstruction and assistance in Lebanon and Palestine, which will be fully committed by the end of 2007.  Since 2003, Irish Aid has made funds of €7.4 million available for humanitarian interventions in Iraq.  Irish Aid supported activities currently include mines clearance work by the Mines Advisory Group and health care programmes for the Marsh Arab population run by the Amar Foundation.  Ireland will continue to respond to the emergency situation in Iraq in 2007 as needs emerge.</p>

            <p eId="para_1192">The St. Andrews Agreement set out a clear timetable for the restoration of the political institutions in Northern Ireland. It also made clear that, as part of that process, all parties would fully support policing and the rule of law, while also recognising the right of every political party to hold the police to account.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">In this regard, the St Andrews Agreement outlined the essential elements of support for the police and criminal justice system, including endorsing the PSNI, actively encouraging everyone in the community to co-operate fully with the PSNI in tackling crime in all areas, and actively supporting all the policing and criminal justice institutions, including the Policing Board. It also set a target-date of May 2008 for the transfer of policing and justice powers to the devolved Institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">Both Governments have been engaged in ongoing contact with the political parties to ensure that the various elements in the St. Andrews package are implemented. The first meeting of the Programme for Government Committee took place on Monday last, 20 November, to begin preparations for the full restoration of the Assembly and Executive next March. It is intended that this Committee, which includes Sinn Féin and other parties likely to comprise the incoming Executive, will consider a number of important issues in the coming weeks, including outstanding policing matters. We have consistently urged all parties to support policing, and urge them to take without delay any steps necessary to achieve this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">The convening of the Programme for Government meeting, and the expectation of further progress in the weeks ahead, reflect the overwhelming desire of people North and South to see the restoration of the political institutions in Northern Ireland and support by all parties for the policing and criminal justice system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">We will continue our efforts in the period ahead to secure the implementation of all the commitments set out in the St Andrews Agreement, including those relating to policing. We look forward to the support of all the political parties in this task.</p>

            <p eId="para_1202">I met with my Estonian colleague Urmas Paet in Dublin on 31 October. We had a very useful and open discussion on a number of important international and EU topics. The subjects covered in the course of our discussion included Irish-Estonian bilateral relations, the European Constitutional Treaty, European Neighbourhood Policy, EU Enlargement, EU-Russia relations, Common Agricultural Policy and Review of Financial Perspectives, Energy Policy, EU Battlegroups, Development Cooperation, and Afghanistan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">In an enlarged European Union, it is vitally important that we maintain good bilateral relations with our EU partners.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1205">Citizenship on the basis of marriage to an Irish citizen, until recently, could be acquired in one of two ways.  Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 (INCA) provided that spouses of Irish citizens, who were citizens other than by naturalisation could claim citizenship as of right once they had been married for three years by making a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship.  There was no residence requirement under this section.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">Spouses of Irish citizens, who had gained their citizenship by naturalisation themselves, were required to apply for naturalisation and comply with the normal statutory conditions for naturalisation contained in section 15 of INCA, namely residence in the State, being of full age and of good character and having an intention to reside permanently in the State after naturalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">Under an amendment to the INCA in 2001 post-nuptial citizenship was phased out over a three year period from the commencement of the Act on 29th November 2002 by a specific provision in Section 15A of the INCA.  This provided, inter alia, for a three year rather than a five year residence requirement and a three year subsisting marriage requirement, both of which I am entitled to waive in cases where the applicant shows that they may suffer serious consequences in respect of their bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">In the interests of fairness to all concerned, it is the practice of the Citizenship Division of my Department to process cases in chronological order based upon the date of receipt of the application.  As the conditions for naturalisation for the spouses of Irish citizens are generally the same as those for other applicants for naturalisation, I see no reason to deviate from the present practice in their case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">The only areas where the above practice is not observed involve applications by persons with refugee status or where the application is made on behalf of a minor.  In the case of applicants with refugee status the Government has obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951.  Accordingly every effort is made to ensure that applications from such applicants are dealt with as quickly as possible, having regard to the general volume of applications.  Where applications made on behalf of minors are concerned, these generally require less processing than standard adult applications so it is usually possible to finalise them more quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received in the Citizenship section of my Department from the person referred to in the Deputy's question on 28 July 2005.  Applications received in the second half of 2004 are currently being processed and there are approximately 3900 applications awaiting processing before that of the person in question.  It is likely that processing of the application of the person concerned will commence in the second half of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">Meanwhile, if the person concerned wishes to travel outside of the State prior to her application for naturalisation being finalised, she can travel on her current passport and apply, in advance of her departure from the State, for a re-entry visa to the Visa Office at 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.</p>

            <p eId="para_1214">An immigration officer at any point of entry to the State has the power to refuse leave to land to a person seeking to enter the State pursuant to Section 4 (3) of the Immigration Act, 2004. I am informed that in this case, it appears that the immigration officer relied on Section 4 (3) (g) of the aforementioned Act. The relevant section provides, inter alia, that ‘An immigration officer may, on behalf of the Minister, refuse to give permission to land to a non-national if the officer is satisfied that he/she is not in possession of a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality'.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">As the immigration officer was acting within his remit and in accordance with the statute law of the State, the issue of compensation does not arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1218">I should point out that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1403">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 on Thursday, 16 November, 2006, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Division as at 21 November, 2006 was 367 (all ranks). The personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Division as at 31 December, 1997 was 281 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 86 (or 30.6%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Establishment Redistribution Model (GERM) is utilized as an indicator for the effective means to distribute Garda personnel throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">In addition, I should remind the Deputy of the role of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate which I established in July 2006.  Its objective, as set out in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, is to ensure that the resources available to An Garda Síochána are used, so as to achieve and maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services. One of the areas currently being examined by the Inspectorate as part of an operational and administrative assessment of the Garda Síochána includes Resource Allocation, including the deployment of Garda and civilian personnel. I have asked for an interim report from the Inspectorate no later than January 2007 and a final report by May 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1428">As the Deputy will be aware, very significant levels of funding are being provided to community based drugs projects under the Government's National Drugs Strategy through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces initiative as well as the Young People's Facilities and Services fund under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">My own Department's remit in this field, insofar as funding is concerned, is primarily focused on support for offenders and ex-offenders, as well as in the area of Youth Diversion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">In 2006 the budget allocation for assistance to voluntary bodies from the Probation Service amounted to €20.827 million.   I am pleased to advise the Deputy that for the coming year this has been increased to €24.096 million.  Of the €20.827 million allocated in 2006, €2.412 million was provided for drug treatment programmes including counselling for the treatment of drug, alcohol and other addictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">In addition to the above, I can inform the Deputy that there are a further five Probation led projects, approved by Local Drugs Task Forces, which are currently operating on a pilot basis.     While the projects are operating on a pilot basis the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provides the funding, channelled through my Department.  Currently the grants to these five projects amount to almost €2.52 million.  Subject to favourable evaluation, these projects will in future be funded by my Department through the Probation Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">The Irish Prison Service and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs have through the Dormant Accounts Fund also made available funding for a number of pilot projects in this area.  These pilots will take place over the coming years and are related to throughcare focused addiction counselling work for prisoners.  The Irish Prison Service also supports the provision of addiction counselling by community groups in a number of prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the work of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seek to divert young persons from becoming involved — or further involved — in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.  The projects are funded by my Department and administered by the Community Relations Section of An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">I secured increases in funding for the Garda Youth Diversion Projects bringing the total funding to €6.6 million in 2006 and to €9.8 million for 2007.  This funding supports Garda Youth Diversion Projects and mainstreamed Local Drugs Task Force Projects, of which there are seven.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">The increase in funding has enabled me to begin an expansion of the programme from 64 Garda Youth Diversion Projects at the beginning of this year to 84 projects nationwide 	before the end of 2006.  It is my intention that there will be at 100 projects nationwide before the end of 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1437">The Government's National Strategy 2001-2008 addresses the problem of drug misuse under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State Mr. Noel Ahern, is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the Strategy. The allocation of funding to the regional drugs task forces is, therefore, a matter which comes under the remit of that Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">My Department's remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction and drug law enforcement, remains a key feature of the Government's drug policy framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">An Garda Síochána invokes a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1441">Identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this state.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1442">Conducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1443">Working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1444">Working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">Tackling organised crime and drug trafficking is primarily achieved through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence led operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">The Organised Crime Unit, established in November 2005, in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Gardaí, continue to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">These operations, which are ongoing, continue to dismantle drug trafficking networks and have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals both based here and abroad who are involved in the drugs trade and very significant drug seizures continue to be made by An Garda Síochána as a result of this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">The record level of resources, both in financial and personnel terms, being made available to An Garda Síochána this year is proof of the Government's commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">Furthermore we are ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work tackling those involved in such criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">While our legislative package for tackling drug trafficking is already viewed as being one of the most stringent in Europe, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for further measures which will enhance the powers of the Gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">Finally, I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains resolutely committed to addressing this issue as an  ongoing matter of priority through our National Drugs Strategy.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1455">(i) A taxable supply of goods.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1456">(ii) An exempt supply of dispensing services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">The decision in question followed similar decisions in the UK courts.  The Revenue Commissioners have accepted the decision.  The principle that there are in fact two separate supplies involved is beyond dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">As a result, many opticians now find themselves in a position to claim a refund from Revenue of a portion of the VAT accounted for by them on their supplies of corrective spectacles and contact lenses.  VAT is a consumption tax collected and accounted for by businesses.  Refunds of VAT are made to the persons chargeable to, and accountable for, the tax.  There are no provisions in EU VAT law which could enable repayment of VAT to be made by Revenue to the ultimate consumer, in this instance, the customers of the opticians.  Therefore, the question of refunds to the opticians' customers is a matter for the optician and customer concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1464">As the Deputy is aware, I do not comment on possible changes ahead of the Budget.  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are unable, due to data difficulties, to provide a cost for introducing an exemption from stamp duty for sporting bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">The Deputy may already be aware of the fact that an exemption from stamp duty is provided for in the stamp duty code in respect of a conveyance, transfer or lease of land made for charitable purposes to a body of persons established for charitable purposes only.  This exemption is confined to bodies of persons which are recognised under law as having been established for charitable purposes only in which case the entirety of the activities carried on by the body in question must be charitable in nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">In this regard, voluntary sporting bodies that do not have this charitable exemption are liable to stamp duty in the normal manner.  However, there are separate relieving provisions in the tax code for not-for-profit and member-controlled sporting bodies.  Amateur and athletic associations are not liable to income tax.  In addition, a generous capital gains tax exemption is available to sports bodies where they dispose of a property and the proceeds are re-invested in new assets for the promotion of the sport in question.  In this situation, capital gains tax is not payable.  In addition, sporting organisations can avail of the special donations scheme.  Where donations are made to qualifying sporting associations, the Revenue Commissioners will apply relief on the donation at the donor's marginal tax rate and refund the relief to the sports body in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to furnish figures of the VAT paid by exempt sporting and voluntary bodies on their purchases of goods and services from VAT registered bodies, as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular consumers to be identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">The position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</p>

            <p eId="para_1472">The application of VAT in these cases is governed by EU law. Nursing home services provided by the HSE are not, as the Deputy suggests, subject to the zero VAT rate. The position is that homecare services provided directly by the Health Service Executive are exempt from VAT, as public bodies are not regarded as taxable persons. This means that they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on their input costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">Under the Sixth VAT Directive Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services, which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  The provision of homecare services was not zero rated on 1 January 1991 and cannot therefore be zero rated. Accordingly, private providers of homecare services must charge VAT at the appropriate rate of up to 21%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that VAT returns are not compiled in a manner which would allow the yield from particular goods or services to be identified.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1497">The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) on 31 December each year, which notional amount will be taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate. Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners will be credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">As a transitional measure, the 3% rate will be phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% in 2009 and each subsequent year. The new regime will apply to ARFs created on or after 6 April 2000 where the ARF holder is 60 years of age or over for the whole of a tax year. The new provisions do not impact on Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs).</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">This measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners last year (and which was published earlier this year) found that the ARF option was largely not being used, as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement but instead was being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term.  The imputed distribution measure will encourage the use of ARFs as intended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have recently commenced discussions with pension industry representative bodies with a view to clarifying the detailed operational aspects of the new provisions. The broad operational features of the new provisions can, however, be summarised as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1501">The qualifying fund manager (QFM) will be required to value the assets in the ARF or ARFs (where there is more than one ARF beneficially owned by the same individual and managed by the same QFM) on 31 December in each year commencing in 2007.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1502">The QFM will determine the amount of the notional distribution, called the "specified amount" in the legislation, by applying the appropriate percentage rate to this value (1% for 2007 rising to the full 3% for 2009 and thereafter).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1503">The QFM may deduct the value of any actual distributions made from the ARF or ARFs, and any actual distributions made from an AMRF beneficially owned by the same individual, to arrive at the net notional distribution, if any, to be subject to tax.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1504">The notional distribution, if any, is deemed to arise in January of the year following the year of assessment in respect of which it has been determined (e.g. the notional distribution calculated for 2007 will be regarded as arising in January 2008).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1505">Where an individual is the beneficial owner of more than one ARF which are not all managed by the same QFM, he may nominate one of the QFMs to meet his overall obligations under the new provisions.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1506">In the above circumstances, the other QFMs are required to certify to the nominee within 14 days of the end of the year of assessment, the value of the assets in the ARF or ARFs managed by them and the amount(s) of any actual distributions made from those ARFs (and from any AMRF managed by them) in that year.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1507">The nominee will then calculate the notional distribution as if all of the ARFs were managed by the nominee and as if all of the actual distributions were made by the nominee to arrive at the overall net notional distribution, if any.</p>

For 2007, I am not in a position to state what the equivalent maximum tax relievable contribution will be as the earnings cap is to be increased with effect from 1 January 2007 in line with an earnings index which I will be announcing next month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">Contributions to an occupational pension scheme made by an employer on behalf of an employee, whether a director or not, are not affected by the age related percentage limits or earnings cap that apply in relation to employee contributions. However, the annual employer contribution must not be of such an amount that, if the contribution were to be continued throughout the lifetime of the scheme, it would lead to over-funding. In that regard, the overall tax relieved pension fund which can be created by both employer and employee contributions is limited, in the first instance, to a fund capable of providing the statutory maximum pension benefits of 2/3rds of the employee's final remuneration, subject to the further restriction with effect from 7 December 2005, that the capital value of those benefits may not exceed the "standard fund threshold" of €5 million. As a transitional measure, a higher limit may apply where the value of an individual's pension fund exceeded €5million on 7 December 2005 (the "personal fund threshold"). Both the standard fund threshold of €5 million and the personal fund threshold, where one applies, will also be indexed in line with the earnings factor referred to above from 2007 onwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1537">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no specific tax breaks available to build leisure centres, bowling alleys and kiddies play complexes. Tax relief, in the form of capital allowances, may be available under one of the general property-based incentive schemes, depending on where the premises is located and the circumstances of the case.  Tax relief is available for the construction of certain commercial premises under the Urban Renewal, Town Renewal and Rural Renewal schemes.  In general, commercial premises must be in use either by an owner-occupier for the purposes of a trade or profession or by a lessee who is renting the premises on commercial terms. Capital allowances may also be available for the construction of a leisure centre in circumstances where the leisure centre forms part of a hotel that has been included in the Fáilte Ireland register of hotels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">Information on the various property-based incentive schemes is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie in the ‘Leaflets and Guides' section and in the publication ‘Tax Briefing'.

            <p eId="para_1539">As regards grants for the types of facilities referred to by the Deputy, this is a matter for the various spending Departments. I am, however, informed by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism that the sports capital programme, which is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, is the primary means of providing Government funding for community based sports facilities. It does not fund commercial enterprises.  Projects submitting an application to the programme must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreational sport facilities and be of a capital nature, which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1540">expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process; and</p>

Over €8 million was allocated for this purpose over the period 2004-2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_1545">The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.

            <p eId="para_1552">The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant Health Service Executive area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.

            <p eId="para_1553">A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1648">The Commission conducted an intensive and analytical examination of Assisted Human Reproduction issues, and its conclusions derive from this wide research. Its report was prepared after twenty three meetings. It also consulted widely and sought submissions from the public.  The Commission's report was published in May 2005 and the Government referred the report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  This process was intended to allow for further consideration of the complex issues involved and the Committee's report along with the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, will help to inform future policy in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">In the meantime, I have instructed my Department to begin preparing for legislation in this area, and the recent High Court judgement will be examined as part of this process. This work will involve consideration of a wide range of issues in order to develop an appropriate structure for the regulation of this area.  It is not possible at this point to say when this process will be completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1677">Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract.  It can affect any area of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, but it most commonly affects the lower part of the small intestine. Common symptoms of Crohn's disease include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and rectal bleeding.  It has been estimated that Crohn's affects one to three per 1,000 adults in Western countries. Crohn's disease affects males and females equally.  The precise cause of Crohn's disease is as yet unknown but there appears to be both genetic and environmental components.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">Treatment of Crohn's disease depends both on the site of the gastrointestinal tract affected, the severity of the inflammation and whether this is complicated by infection.  Care is best coordinated by a multidisciplinary team involving medical and surgical gastroenterologists, dieticians and clinical nurse specialists with an interest in nutrition and stoma care.  Treatment is determined on a case by case basis and may include specific drug therapy and surgery and nutritional support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">There have been significant advances in drug therapy for Crohn's disease over the last 20 years. Specific drug therapies have included corticosteroid therapies, aminosalicylates such as Asacol and Pentasa, antibiotics and immunosuppressive therapy. More recently a class of drugs known as tumour necrosis factors agents have been used for the treatment of Crohn's disease.  Infliximab is a member of this family of agents and was first used for the treatment of Crohn's disease in the USA in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">Advances in the medical treatment of Crohn's disease are ongoing. Research is ongoing to facilitate targeted delivery of medication specifically to the site of the disease. Improved understanding of the causes of Crohn's disease will lead to the development of further drugs such as the necrosis factors agents which are targeted at specific points in the inflammatory pathway.  Bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy are also undergoing research as possible treatment for Crohn's disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">Surgery is considered for those patients whose disease does not respond to drug or dietary measures.  In addition undernourished patients or those who have undergone bowel surgery may require additional protein and nutrient supplementation.  All these therapies are available for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1690">The decision to transfer St. Luke's Hospital was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke's.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke's are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  Medical and scientific experts from St. Luke's are involved in developing the output specifications for the delivery of new radiation oncology services nationally.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke's will lead the management team of the new facility at St. James's.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke's to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the National Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">The tender has recently been awarded for two additional and two replacement linear accelerators at St. Luke's to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan.  I expect these services to commence late next year.  I also recently announced the approval of two radiation oncology facilities at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals, comprising of two linear accelerators and associated treatment planning at each site, to be delivered in early 2009.  These are key elements of the delivery of the National Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">The expertise and professional commitment of the staff at St. Luke's Hospital will continue to be an essential element in the development of cancer care.</p>

            <p eId="para_1697">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of affordable, high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.

My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1722">Production of Corrib Gas Field is a major infrastructural project, which has the potential to play a significant role in the economic and social regeneration of Mayo and the northwest region. It will facilitate the improvement of the region's infrastructure and increase local employment, in both the short and long term. The development will also increase Ireland's security of supply by providing a reliable, secure and indigenous source of gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">Construction work on the Corrib project will contribute to Exchequer income from corporation, payroll and indirect taxation insofar as it relies on sourcing of Irish skills, staff and material. Operation of the field will similarly contribute to the Exchequer and will also yield lease rental income.  In addition to sharing in general prosperity, communities in Mayo will benefit where there is local sourcing of workers, services and goods. The project will generate over 700 jobs in the construction phase of the Bellanaboy Gas Terminal. It is also anticipated that 50 to 60 staff in three shifts will be employed to operate the terminal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">I understand that the developers recently issued letters of intent to a number of Irish contractors for work on the site, valued in the region of €76 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">I also welcome the recent decision by the Energy Regulator to extend the natural gas network to eleven towns along the route of its Mayo- Galway transmission pipeline. Athenry, Craughwell, Headford, and Tuam in Co. Galway and Ballina, Ballyhaunis, Castlebar, Claremorris, Crossmolina, Knock and Westport in Co. Mayo will all benefit from new gas connections.  This has been made possible because of work undertaken by Bord Gáis in anticipation of landing gas from Corrib and introducing it into the gas transmission network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Coming specifically to the actual revenue to be generated from the field, I should point out that the principal mechanism for extracting State revenue from offshore production under the current exploration terms is via a special higher rate of Corporation Profits Tax at 25%.  My Department claims no particular expertise in taxation matters, which is the preserve of the Revenue Commissioners.  However, taking current estimates of the recoverable reserves, applying the recent market price for gas and roughly estimating the cost of production over the life of the field would lead to a figure for direct Government revenue of the order of one and a half billion Euro. It will be appreciated that each of these parameters is subject to significant variation and that the timing and profile of production would also have an impact.  This calculation is based on a historically very high gas price and the reality could be considerably lower. I am not in a position to estimate the indirect revenue referred to earlier, which is likely to be significant. I would also reiterate that the terms themselves are under review although the outcome of the review will not affect existing licences and leases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1737">Buildings have a large part to play in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet our Kyoto commitments and reduce our reliance on imported energy. It has been estimated that lighting, space heating and cooling of buildings is responsible for 40% of final energy use in the EU. Research has shown that more than 20% of present energy consumption could be saved by 2020 by applying stricter standards to buildings undergoing refurbishment and to new buildings. Energy use in the commercial and public services sector grew by 70% over the period 1990 to 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">The Public Sector Programme of Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) recognises the diversity of buildings, the potential for improvement, impending regulations and directives, and the capacity to influence other sectors of the economy. Dissemination of good practice and implementation through demonstration projects, publications and seminars is central to the activities of the public sector programme.  It promotes energy efficient design, technologies and services in new and retrofit projects. Under the programme energy performance is enhanced through design, investment and management. Supported projects act as examples of good practice, as a demand leader for the services and technologies involved, and help build sustainable energy capabilities among key service professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">The programme supports three streams of activity: design study support scheme, model solution investment support scheme and the energy management bureaux. The Design Study Support Scheme provides support for professional expertise to examine the technical and economic feasibility of design and technology solutions. Model Solutions Investment Support Scheme supports energy management and technology solutions in existing buildings and specifications for new buildings. Energy Management Bureau are a outsourced energy management services to manage energy usage, identify and implement energy related projects in groups of entities that come together for the purpose such as UCD, TCD, DIT and DCU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">The estimated energy spend for the total public sector in 2005 is €1.15 billion. This is based on a 60/40 split between private/public services. The 2003 Services inquiry put energy spend for private services at €1.47 billion and allowing about 15% for inflation this gives a value of €1.15 billion. The carbon dioxide emissions for the public sector amounted to 2,674 kt in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">At present specific figures for energy use in schools are not available for the entire country. Schools are allocated an allowance per pupil for building operation and each school pays its own utility bills. The introduction of the energy performance of buildings directive will result in the publication and collation of energy use for all public buildings. Specifically the public sector programme has supported a model school in Tullamore, Gaelscoil an Eiscir Riada.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">Also in 2006 Sustainable Energy Ireland supported a generic design study for an energy efficient template for primary schools in partnership with the Department of Education and Science. This is published on its website. A number of schools including Archbishop Ryan National School in Balgaddy, Lucan, have been completed using this template.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">Other work with the Department of Education and Science includes a pilot project to install wood pellet boilers in schools.</p>

I expect to receive the report in the coming weeks and will carefully consider its recommendations and the additional funding requirements. I will pursue additional grant aid funding where I consider it necessary to deliver on this development strategy.</p>

         further to the recent announcement that consultants are to be appointed to examine ways of resolving a dispute over the lowering of a weir on the river Blackwater which anglers say is necessary to allow salmon stocks to regenerate, but which a local rowing club fears will lead to its demise, the price that will be paid for said consultants; if he sought a way for his Department to mediate regarding this dispute; the amount the report he commissioned, which recommended lowering the weir by a metre, cost; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1807">I recently exercised my powers under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 to issue a notice to Fermoy Town Council to carry out the alterations necessary to the Fermoy Weir in order to allow for the free passage of fish. I did this in the interests of conserving and protecting the wild salmon resource and in order to avoid the initiation of infringement proceedings by the EU Commission under the Habitats Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">My decision was informed by a report and recommendations following examination, as part of the process, by the Department's Engineering Division. In summary, the report recommended that approximately 80 metres of that part of the Fermoy Weir upstream from the town bridge be lowered to the maximum extent consistent with retaining sufficient depth for rowing activities and that a rock ramp fish pass be installed in the lower weir to enable the free passage of all migratory species.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">I recently met with representatives from Fermoy Town Council and Fermoy Rowing Club to discuss this matter. At the meeting it was agreed that Fermoy Town Council would engage consultants to examine and advise them on this matter. As Fermoy Town Council is the owner of the weir, the cost of any consultancy and subsequent works associated with the weir will have to be borne by it. The Department's engineering experts will be available to the Town Council if needed for the appointment of consultants and to meet the consultants as part of their deliberations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1816">I am aware of a number of scientific reports on the state of fish stocks, one of which in particular made a number of worrying points in relation to dwindling fish stocks worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">Fish stocks in the waters around Ireland are exploited under the umbrella of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. A fundamental principal underpinning this Policy is to manage the exploitation of the stocks in a way that protects their long-term viability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">We know the issues in the waters around Ireland and we are working to address them at national, EU and international levels. We are working hard to strengthen conservation and promote sustainability and have introduced a number of measures over the past few years to address this issue. For example, the EU designated a Biologically Sensitive Area off our south coast in 2003 in recognition of the importance of this area for juvenile fish and for spawning. A recovery plan for hake, near collapse in 2000, was also introduced and the stock has rebuilt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">We must improve our knowledge base and also work towards effective enforcement of controls at national, EU and international level. Irish scientists, industry and managers are working together for example on a suite of new projects that will improve the assessment and advice for key stocks:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1820">Anglerfish off the West of Ireland (surveys on fishing vessels)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1821">Cod in the Celtic Sea (closed boxes introduced to help stock recover)</p>

            <p eId="para_1823">Our common goal is to have a sustainable fishing industry with sustainable fish stocks, operating in a sustainable ocean. This must be done in partnership with stakeholders at EU and international level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">You will be aware that I have appointed a Strategic Review Group that will, inter alia, consider and make recommendations on new marketing initiatives for the Irish seafood sector. A certification scheme such as the Deputy has proposed is one option worthy of consideration in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1826">Russia is a key strategic partner of the European Union, one with which we have a wide-ranging relationship. The EU-Russia relationship is currently governed by a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement which expires in December 2007. There are ambitious plans for a new EU-Russia agreement, which is intended to provide a comprehensive framework for future relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">Regular meetings currently take place at a range of levels, including biannual Summits. President Putin was invited to attend a working dinner held at the informal meeting of the European Heads of State or Government at Lahti on 20 October, which the Taoiseach attended. External energy relations were a key focus of the frank and constructive discussions with President Putin at that meeting. Aspects of the internal situation in Russia, including the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, were raised as were Russia's relations with Georgia and a number of international issues on which the EU and Russia cooperate. It is important that the EU continues to build on the coherent and balanced approach towards Russia which it demonstrated at the Lahti meeting. That meeting has given a political impetus to the overall development of EU-Russia relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">The next EU-Russia Summit will take place tomorrow (24 November) at which the Russian Federation will be represented by President Putin, accompanied by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Summit will be hosted by Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, in his capacity as President of the European Council. It will also be attended by the Secretary-General/High Representative, Dr. Javier Solana, the President of the Commission, Mr. José Manuel Barroso, and Commissioners Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Peter Mandelson.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">A key objective of the forthcoming Summit is to launch negotiations on the new framework Agreement with Russia. As much has changed in the ten years since the current agreement was negotiated, a more comprehensive agreement is required. This needs to take account of the four Common Spaces agreed with Russia in May 2005. These cover the fields of the economy; freedom, security and justice; external security; and research and education, including cultural aspects. The new agreement should also provide for a comprehensive free trade agreement for goods and services. Energy will also be an important sector in the new agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1831">Human rights are, and have always been, a priority of successive Governments and central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, the Government monitors the human rights situations in many countries, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official and non-governmental organisations. Where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question, either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council. At these bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situation in various countries. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an opportunity for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses.

            <p eId="para_1841">The complex series of factors, which contribute to the enormous needs we encounter in Africa, include food insecurity, poverty, environmental degradation, weak governmental capacity and policies, unequal global trading relationships, protracted conflict, severe infrastructural weaknesses, poor governance, debt and the effects of HIV/AIDS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">Addressing Africa's needs, especially the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable, necessitates a comprehensive and coordinated series of actions by the international community and African Governments.  In order to measure development progress and to set benchmarks, the United Nations have developed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were endorsed by world leaders in 2000.  While the MDGs are undoubtedly ambitious, they can be reached if all stakeholders, the affected countries themselves, the donor community, the UN and EU work together to ensure that poverty reduction, good governance and sustainable development are the cornerstones of all our efforts in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">For Ireland, Africa is at the heart of the programme of official development assistance and our approach has a number of distinct but complementary elements. As regards the immediate challenges of natural disasters, conflict and food crisis, our humanitarian budget is a key instrument in meeting immediate needs. Our recovery and long-term development programmes seek to assist countries emerging from natural and man-made emergencies and also address the underlying causes of poverty in all its manifestations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">Long-term development is the core of our aid programme in Africa. We have a strong partnership with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa, namely Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. We are assisting the Governments and peoples of these programme countries to address the fundamental causes of poverty through promoting good governance, delivery of essential basic needs, including the fight against HIV/AIDS and promoting economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">In addition, we work in many other African countries, either directly or through our partnerships with the United Nations, the Red Cross family and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) such as Concern, GOAL, Trócaire, Oxfam and others. In the context of an increasing aid budget, as we approach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012, these interventions are being further strengthened through enhanced support at the global and country levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">Ireland's approach to efforts to promote security and stability in Africa includes our contribution to the security and stability of Liberia through the deployment of troops with Ireland's approach to efforts to promote security and stability in Africa includes our contribution to the security and stability of Liberia through the deployment of troops with UNMIL, the UN Mission in Liberia, since 2003. Ireland has also provided assistance to the African Union (AU) Mission in Sudan (AMIS), as part of the EU's joint actions to foster peace and security in Darfur. In addition, we have pledged support to the UN's Peace Building Fund and have been strongly supportive of the establishment of the Peace Building Commission. We are actively seeking ways to support regional organisations in Africa, particularly the AU, which represents an important strategic partner for the European Union and the international community generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">The challenges facing Africa are enormous but there is some encouraging news. Many African economies are growing. Inflation, now averaging 8% a year, is at its lowest level in many African countries since soon after independence. While there are exceptions such as Somalia, Zimbabwe and others, many African countries now have less violence and civil strife than for many years. There is relative peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola and southern Sudan. We must build on progress. We must address continuing needs. Through our growing aid programme, we will continue to make a difference on the ground in Africa and to work with all donors, including the UN and EU, to make a real and lasting difference in the lives of the poorest in Africa.</p>

            <p eId="para_1849">Considerable progress has made in spreading and deepening democracy in Africa in recent years.  Most African countries have evolved from authoritarian to more democratic systems with elections now becoming the only acceptable basis for choosing and changing leadership; many States are working to ensure that the executive and legislative arms of government reflect the diversity of their people; and most Governments are facilitating increased public participation in the political process.  While credit for this progress must go primarily to the relevant African States, international bodies and donors have also played an important supporting role.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">However, there remain a number of African states which are in no way democratic.  Moreover, in many countries problems remain with regard to the independence and institutional capacity of parliament, the judiciary, the media and civil society.  All these institutions provide the checks and balances needed for democracy to function fully.  Weaknesses in African civil services and corruption are also major challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">The African Union (AU), founded in 2002, is doing much to encourage the positive trend.  One of the key objectives of its Constitutive Act is to "promote democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance", while the Act also provides for suspension from the Union of Governments who come to power through unconstitutional means.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">The AU's socioeconomic initiative, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), has established a ground-breaking mechanism for promoting democracy in the region, the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). This promotes better governance through reports on the policies and actions of AU member states and follow-up recommendations which are reviewed by a forum consisting of the Heads of State of participating countries. 26 African States have joined the process. The first two APRM reviews finalised, on Ghana and Rwanda, were strong and critical. Ireland has already provided €300,000 to strengthen the NEPAD secretariat and will engage with the African Union on how best to support implementation of APRM recommendations at country level. Other EU member states and the European Commission also support the APRM.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">The UN, the World Bank and the OECD's Development Assistance Committee are increasingly engaged in supporting democratic governance in Africa, The European Union also plays a key role, through activities ranging from diplomatic engagement to support for local civic education programs. The EU/ACP Cotonou Agreement, which requires partners to meet standards with regard to respect for democratic principals and the rule of law, has been used widely to encourage democratisation. Work is currently underway to harmonise and better co-ordinate the many ways in which the EU Member States and EU institutions are supporting democratisation in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">Ireland is actively supporting democratisation in Africa. In the White Paper on Irish Aid, the building and strengthening of democracy is defined as a guiding principle for our aid programme. A significant proportion of the budget of Irish Aid is spent on programmes that support governance reform and democratisation in the region. This is provided both through multilateral agencies and in the programme countries. Ireland funds parliamentary and public sector reform, improved legal systems and development of effective oversight institutions such as auditors-general and anti-corruption agencies. We also support civil society organisations and independent media which hold Governments to account.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">In 2006 Irish observers participated in EU election observation missions in Uganda, Zambia, Mauritania and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We also provide targeted support where special needs are identified. This year we provided €1.3 million for the Presidential and parliamentary elections in the DRC, one of the most important elections held in Africa for many years.</p>

Inflation in Zimbabwe is now estimated to be 1200%, the highest in the world, while unemployment is estimated to be around 80%.  There continue to be severe food shortages in the country, with over one million people currently requiring sustained food assistance.  The dire political and economic conditions have led to large-scale emigration, with at least 2 million Zimbabweans now judged to be living illegally in South Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">There is at yet no indication that the Zimbabwean Government is willing to alter the policies which have brought about this situation, or to introduce those democratic and economic reforms long called for by the international community and which, if introduced, would positively influence relations with Zimbabwe.  On the contrary, we have seen increased repression, with large-scale arrests of peaceful demonstrators and credible reports of trade union leaders being seriously ill-treated in police detention following a peaceful protest march in Harare last September.  There is also no evidence of serious efforts by the Zimbabwean government to re-house the many hundreds of thousands of people left homeless, following Operation Murambatsvina, launched in May 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">Against this background, there is little scope for a fundamental review of the restrictive measures which the EU has imposed against Zimbabwe since February 2002. The restrictive measures, involving a travel ban, assets freeze and arms embargo, were renewed last February for a further period of twelve months. These measures are very much targeted at the Mugabe regime, and not at the people of Zimbabwe. The EU has also suspended its development cooperation with Zimbabwe, although certain types of cooperation involving the provision of basic services are exempted, with a view to avoiding an adverse effect on the population.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">It is clear that international pressure needs to be maintained on the Mugabe Government to alter its current policies. Ireland and our EU partners are determined to continue working with others in the international community, including our partners in Africa who can exert particular influence, to help promote democratic change in Zimbabwe. I discussed the current situation in Zimbabwe with the South African Deputy President during her visit to Dublin on 16 November and urged South Africa to continue its efforts to influence the situation positively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">The Government's concerns were also conveyed at a meeting on 23 October between senior officials of my Department and the new Zimbabwean Ambassador to Ireland. EU Ambassadors in Zimbabwe, including Ireland's, are also maintaining contact with all those within Zimbabwean society who may be in a position to influence positive change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">The Government is continuing to make available humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. Since 2004 Ireland has committed over €13 million in aid to Zimbabwe, including €3.7 million this year to address emergency needs. The largest proportion of this funding is for immediate humanitarian needs, particularly the provision of food assistance. Ireland is also providing funding to mitigate the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Zimbabwe which is estimated to infect 25% of the population. Earlier this year Ireland approved a new programme of funding for HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe amounting to €7.5m over the years 2006-2008.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1869">The question of providing appropriate education and training for low skilled and semi-skilled workers in the construction industry is kept under regular review and there are currently a number of research projects being conducted on the subject.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">First, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which is made up of representatives of a range of interests concerned with future skills needs and reports jointly to the Minister for Education and Science and to me, has established a Steering Group to oversee research into the particular needs of the construction industry.  This research is being led by the research department of FÁS and will consider the growth of the construction sector in general and the likely trends across the various occupations within the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">Second, the EGFSN has also conducted major research on Ireland's future skills needs.  While, this study, which was previewed at the National Skills Conference in Farmleigh in October, and covered the whole economy, some of its major conclusions are also relevant to the construction sector.  Overall, the research suggests that Ireland will need to up-skill a large number of employed persons over the next decade if we are to achieve our goal of becoming a successful competitive and inclusive society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">Third, the Deputy may also wish to be aware of a research study in respect of the construction industry that is being conducted across both Ireland and the United Kingdom into labour mobility.  This study will involve a large-scale survey of the construction industry, and help us to better understand working patterns in this sector.  FÁS is supporting the Irish element of the study.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">A very large number of apprentices are trained for the construction industry each year by FÁS, the Institutes of Technology and, of course, the industry itself.  The Universities and Institutes of Technology provide education across the range of professional occupations such as engineering, surveying, and architects.  FÁS also provides training for those already working in the industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1875">The issue of site visits is a matter for the relevant industrial development agencies, and not one in which I am directly involved.  Itineraries for site visits generally relate to mobile investments, normally from overseas.  Enterprise Ireland's portfolio of indigenous client companies is, of its nature, not very mobile, therefore the number of site visits arranged by the agency only relates to a small number of companies.  Any such visits are primarily for natural resource companies, taking into account their special location requirements, such as access to raw materials and to facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">When a situation arises that an Irish company is interested in relocating or expanding to another part of the country, the Enterprise Ireland office in that region will assist in providing information on premises and services available locally, and contact details for other information sources in the region.  Within the last year, Enterprise Ireland arranged three site visits to County Laois and one to County Offaly on behalf of a group of investors who are seeking to establish an Irish based manufacturing facility in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1878">Support for job creation and investment in individual counties and towns is a day-to-day operational matter for the development agencies as part of their responsibility under the Industrial Development Acts.  While I may give general policy directives to the agencies I am precluded under the Industrial Developments Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">There have been 6 first time site visits to County Laois and 2 first time site visits to County Offaly that were hosted by IDA Ireland over the past 12 months.  IDA Midlands Region consists of Counties Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath and Roscommon.  The locations of emphasis for IDA in these counties are the NSS Gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  In addition IDA actively promotes the county towns of Portlaoise, Longford and Roscommon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">IDA Ireland's strategy for the Midlands Region is: to progress the development of a knowledge economy, in order that the Region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment; to work with the existing client base in the Counties and to expand their presence in the various Counties; to provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure; and to work with the Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the various counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">To support this strategy IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment.  IDA is also working with FÁS to provide guidance in developing the appropriate skill sets needs of those already in the workforce.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for the Region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1915">As a consequence of an EU Commission Decision in the year 2000, which was subsequently confirmed by a Judgement of the European Court of Justice in 2005, €15.6 million of European Social Fund monies have been withheld from Ireland. This reduction applied to the Human Resources, Tourism and Industry Operational Programmes for the programming period 1994-1999. The amount withheld represents less than 1% of the €1,897 million in ESF allocated to these Operational Programmes in total.  As part of the closure process of the three Operation Programmes, the audit trail was reconstructed and confirmed by my Department.  With regard to the compliance by my Department with EU Regulation 2064/97, I would refer to the decision of the European Court of Justice in this matter (see paragraph 36-53, in particular) where it is clearly stated that the Commission Decision was not based on any provision of EU Regulation 2064/97, but was based on other provisions in force at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1917">Enterprise Ireland occupies four separate offices in Dublin.  Discussions on bringing all Enterprise Ireland Dublin based staff together in one location have been going on since the Agency was established in 1998.  One of the options considered was that of developing the Agency's Glasnevin site to provide accommodation for all Dublin staff.  However, when the Government's decentralisation programme was announced in December 2003, the option of investing in new purpose-built premises on the Glasnevin site was deemed to be inconsistent with the proposed decentralisation of some 300 of EI staff to Shannon.  Enterprise Ireland nevertheless faced the same operational challenge of occupying four separate locations across Dublin.  This, plus the fact that the leaseholds on two of these premises are due to expire in 2008, meant that the Agency had to come up with an office solution that would, on the one hand provide suitable accommodation for the staff currently spread across the four separate Dublin locations, and on the other hand give EI the flexibility to comply with the Government's decentralisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">Having explored a number of possible solutions, the Board of Enterprise Ireland decided that the single site office in the East Point Business Park was the most appropriate from a number of perspectives, including value for money and flexibility.  In September of this year, following the Board decision, EI signed a normal commercial 25 year lease on the units in East Point.  The lease has in-built break clauses and a clause to enable the Agency to sub-let space, if required.</p>

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family's net earnings and the number of children under aged 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full time education.</p>

            <p eId="para_1971">My Department has capital funding available under Transport 21 for the development of park and ride facilities, subject to suitable business cases being made.  My Department does not provide funding for the operation of such facilities.  The issue of charging is a matter for those operating these facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">However, as I have indicated before, a number of guiding principles for the implementation of rail-based park and ride strategy have been identified by the Dublin Transportation Office, and these principles will be expected to inform local authorities and service providers of both bus and rail-related park and ride in accordance with Transport 21.  These principles are: park and ride should improve rail accessibility without disimproving road congestion; rail users only should use park and ride spaces and may have to pay to use them; complementary parking controls in the areas around stations may be required; rail fares generally should not be increased to pay for park and ride; those who benefit from park and ride should contribute to the cost of it; rail services must be able to serve the demand generated by park and ride provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">Park and ride facilities can and do have a positive impact on public transport use, and have an important role to play in encouraging people to transfer from private cars to public transport.  In considering whether to impose charges towards meeting the operating costs of park and ride facilities, providers can be expected to take into account a variety of factors, and these would of course include consideration of the likely impact of charges on use of the facility and, by extension, on public transport use.</p>

My Department and Irish Rail accord a high priority to this project, which is intended to be the final phase of a programme to extend and reconfigure the DART and suburban services and to provide higher capacities, frequencies and integration of services to meet forecast demand levels in the Dublin inner-suburban area and to develop an integrated transport system for the capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1978">There are a number of projects currently under way that are necessary to prepare for the development of the interconnector including the Kildare Route Project, feasibility study on the electrification of the Maynooth line and two complementary planning studies on the Interconnector. Irish Rail and the Railway Procurement Agency are also working well together to ensure that planning for both the Interconnector and the Metro is properly integrated. On this basis and taking account of the scale and extent of this project, I am confident that the timeframe for the delivery of the Interconnector as set out in Transport 21 is realistic and achievable.</p>

            <p eId="para_1989">I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 242 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">The Government is tackling the misuse of drugs in a concerted, planned and integrated way on several fronts under the National Drugs Strategy.  The overall Strategy is being implemented across a range of Government Departments and agencies in conjunction with the community and voluntary sectors.  Co-ordinated by my Department through the mechanisms of the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces and the Young People's Facilities and Services fund, the Strategy is underpinned by a process of co-operation and partnership between all sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1991">Since 1997, across the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas, over 450 community-based projects have been established with funding in the region of €125m provided.  These projects, some of which have been assigned to other Departments and Agencies in the interim, employ more than 300 people.  In the current year, 361 projects, including those under the Emerging Needs Fund, are receiving interim funding totalling €20.2 million from my Department.  Of these, 174 projects deal with the issues of treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">I allocated €5 million in 2006 to the ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) to facilitate the commencement of the implementation of their action plans.  The National Drugs Strategy Team has been working closely with the RDTFs to get their programmes up and running as speedily as possible.  68 projects have been initiated in 2006 and it is envisaged that around 80 projects will be in progress by the end of the year.  59 projects proposed by the RDTFs deal with treatment and rehabilitation and are currently at various stages of development.  Funding will be increased on an incremental basis to achieve full roll-out of the RDTF plans estimated to have an annual cost of around €14 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">Through the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, which was established in 1998, funding is made available towards the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services.  These are specifically aimed at attracting "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into activities that will divert them from the dangers of drugs misuse.  In all, approximately 460 facility and services projects are being supported under the Fund, which has a total allocation to date of approximately €107 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1994">Overall, I am satisfied with the level of progress being made.  Tackling the drug problem is a key priority for Government and will continue to be so.</p>

            <p eId="para_2003">The EU legal basis for the TB and Brucellosis schemes is primarily Directive 64/432/EEC, which governs trade of bovine animals.  Other EU legislation which includes provisions relating to these diseases are Directives 64/433/EEC, 92/46/EEC, Regulation No. 2004/853/EC and legislation governing Community co-financing of eradication programmes (Directive 77/391/EEC and Decision 90/424/EEC) and amendments updating such legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">Directive 64/432/EEC provides, inter alia, that all animals are subject to test at intervals determined by the national disease level.  At current disease levels in Ireland, all herds and all eligible animals must be tested annually.  In the case of TB, eligible animals include all bovine animals on the holding, with the exception of calves under 6 weeks which were born on the holding.  For Brucellosis, eligible animals are all female bovines and bulls over 12 months of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_2005">With regard to national legislation, the provisions governing TB and Brucellosis testing are contained in the 1966 Diseases of Animals Act (as amended) and in Orders made under the Act.  The principal Order in relation to TB is the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order 1989, (S.I. No. 308 of 1989).  In the case of TB, eligible animals being moved out of a herd must have passed a TB test within the previous 12 months in accordance with Article 17 of the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order 1989, (S.I.

            <p eId="para_2009">The herdnumber of the person mentioned has been suspended and his holding has been restricted because he has failed to have conducted the tests required to maintain the health status of his herd and has further refused to comply with notices issued by my Department to have his herd tested for Bovine Tuberculosis and Bovine Brucellosis.  The herd belonging to this person was last tested for TB on 30 September 2004 and for Brucellosis on 27 September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">An attempt was made to hand deliver formal statutory notices under the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order 1989 and the Brucellosis in Cattle (General Provisions) Order 1991 to the person's premises by Department official on 11 November 2005.  Having failed to serve these notices on the person, they were forwarded to the person by registered post on the same date.  Receipt of the documents was acknowledged in writing by the person.  The notices were re-issued on 1 December 2005, requiring the tests to be carried out by 15 December 2005.  To date, the person has not complied with these notices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2011">The legal basis for these notices is the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 and the TB and Brucellosis Orders made thereunder and mentioned above and EU Directive 64/432/EEC, which governs trade of bovine animals and sets out the conditions required to establish and maintain health status for TB and Brucellosis.  In addition, my Department's administrative rules provide for the suspension of a herdnumber where there has been a failure to comply with the testing requirements issued by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2012">The objective of the TB and Brucellosis eradication schemes is to reduce and eventually eradicate these two diseases and it is the responsibility of keepers and herdowners to arrange with their private veterinary practitioner for the tests to be carried out.  The herdnumber will be restored when the tests have been carried out and the restriction notice will be lifted when the officially free status of the herd has been determined.</p>

            <p eId="para_2017">I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 to 252, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">The Ex-Ante Evaluation of the Rural Development Plan does not announce a halving of the forestry planting target.  On the contrary, sufficient funds have been provided in the Rural Development Plan to encourage a renewed planting effort, intended in the first instance to restore annual afforestation rates to at least 10,000 hectares.  We should not underestimate the challenge which lies before us in this regard and the new Forestry Programme takes this into account, incorporating several new and innovative measures to attract farmers into forestry.  These are demand-led schemes and my intention is to stimulate that demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">As regards forestry policy, this was comprehensively reviewed by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates in September 2004.  The report reaffirmed a planting rate of 20,000 hectares per annum as appropriate but significantly noted that lower levels of planting could still provide a viable basis for support when non-timber benefits are maximised.  A high-level Group, which includes representatives from the Department of Finance as well as my own Department, have been examining forestry policy in the light of the Bacon Report and wider EU considerations and I expect its report very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2020">In terms of critical mass, I fully agree with the Deputy on the importance of achieving an appropriate level of forest cover.  This is precisely why I am making some €1 billion available over the course of the Programme to encourage the planting of trees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2021">Finally, on the question of the review of forestry legislation, the main focus here is on the operational provisions of the various Forestry Acts, principally the 1946 Act as amended.  The 1988 Act is not excluded insofar as it deals with operational matters, such as the level of penalties, but the basis for establishing Coillte Teo. is not currently under review.  Coillte continues to operate on a commercial basis and is a profitable company with a clear strategy for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2027">I am aware of the publication referred to by the Deputy.  I am determined to provide more information, for parents in particular, about our schools, in a way that ensures a fair and comprehensive picture of all the different activities in a school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">As I have said on many occasions, I am strongly opposed to the publication of crude league tables based solely on examination or test results.  Such tables provide an unbalanced and grossly limited indication of a school's performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2029">In contrast to school league tables, I believe that school inspection reports from Whole School Evaluations (WSE) and other inspections, when read in their entirety, can provide balanced and well-informed information on schools.  The Whole School Evaluation process involves an examination of all the varied activities of a school — from the quality of teaching and learning to the availability of extra-curricular activities and the implementation of policies in areas such as bullying, and health and safety.  The inspection process also includes consultation with the school's board, parents and staff members, and, at second level, with the school's students.</p>
            <p eId="para_2030">Given the breadth of the contents of WSE reports, I believe that the publication of these and other school inspection reports could go a significant way to addressing the real needs of parents, students, teachers and others for better information on schools.  The type of information provided in WSE reports will help parents who need accurate and balanced information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2031">I am confident that the considered and responsible approach that I am taking to the publication of inspection reports will lead to much greater availability of information on schools without inadvertently pitting schools serving entirely different communities against each other in crude comparisons of academic performance alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2032">In addition, I am confident that the continuing expansion of services, such as supports for children with special needs and children whose first language is not English, and the significant increases in expenditure on capitation announced in the Estimates will greatly assist all schools in meeting the needs of their students and in further improving the quality of the education they provide.</p>

            <p eId="para_2037">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.   The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the School Support Programme. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2040">The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31st March, 2006. An application for review was not received from the school referred to by the Deputy. The Group has submitted a final report and the review process is now concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">Schools which have not qualified for the new School Support Programme and which are receiving additional resources, both human and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing disadvantage, will retain these supports for 2006/2007. After that, schools will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">The DEIS action plan states that, as well as the provision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</p>

My Department would encourage schools to consider the use of wind-generated electricity which is available nationally through the National Grid. This in effect allows the school to benefit from the environmental and lower cost benefits of wind generated electricity without being exposed to operating and maintenance issues and reliability of supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">The Tory Island project involves the supply and installation of two wind turbines to provide electrical energy to serve the existing community facility and Vocational School situated on Tory Island.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">With respect to energy programmes that would compliment environmental work currently taking place under the green flags initiative for the past eight years the Planning and Building Unit within my Department have been using a process called the DART approach (Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology) to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings. The policy is driven by technical guidance documents, informed by building unit professional and technical staff, external partnerships and updated by continued energy research and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">Rather than develop a unique focus on energy design my Department has taken a more holistic approach and have developed their technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents. These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception is encouraged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2049">The incorporation of low energy design has been done on a hybrid basis by maximising natural resources and utilising technologies. This involves focusing on areas such as natural ventilation, passive solar design, day lighting and reducing infiltration, enhanced insulation, lighting and heating controls and water efficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2050">The focus to date on sustainability in schools has been to reduce the energy demand in schools. This has proven quite successful with modern day schools typically using three times less energy than schools built ten years ago and also using less than half the energy than what is termed as good international practice for schools.</p>

The school is currently in rented accommodation and until the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation, interim accommodation will remain the responsibility of the Patron as was conditional when granting recognition to the school.    Earlier this year, my Department wrote to the school authorities confirming that the long term projected staffing for the school had been set at a Principal plus 16 mainstream teachers. Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works (OPW), which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, has been requested to source a suitable site for the school referred to by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_2063">I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 to 265, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">The information regarding the number of children diagnosed with autism is not readily available in my Department. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which is now operational is currently in the process of compiling a nationwide database of all children with autism. It is expected that this database will be completed in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">My Department considers that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department's ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders receive an education appropriate to their needs and in this regard my Department has established: 175 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools, 6 of which are located in the Mayo area; 5 special Classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome; 16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum; 12 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis, four of these facilities are in the Dublin area and one in Galway, Louth, Cork, Waterford, Kildare, Kilkenny, Meath, and Westmeath.  These units currently provide in the region of 217 places. Approval has also been given for the establishment of a further two such facilities in Carlow and Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">My Department supports a multi-skills approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available e.g. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">Additional training supports for staff engaged in the education provision for children with special needs including autism can be accessed through the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The service will, as appropriate, consolidate, co-ordinate, develop and deliver a range of professional development initiatives and support structures to the relevant staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">An application was recently received from the group in question to participate in the pilot scheme which has facilitated the establishment of the ABA-specific autism units nationwide. My officials requested that the names and the psychological assessments of the children proposing to attend the centre should be forwarded to the Department in order to progress the application further. My Department is currently awaiting this information.</p>

            <p eId="para_2076">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion is designed to ensure that the schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">As a result of the identification and review processes under DEIS, 873 schools have been invited to participate in the new Programme. These comprise 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools. As well as the provision being made under the new School Support Programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support is provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">A new streamlined model for allocating financial supports has been devised which takes account of level of disadvantage and relevant financial supports already in place and replaces all other models of grants paid to schools under previous disadvantaged programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">Under this new model grants amounting to approximately €7.7 million due to the 670 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS initiative were lodged to their schools' bank accounts on 17 November 2006. This is in addition to payments totalling €1 million which issued to those schools in June 2006. Provision is also being made for the issue of grants in the case of the 203 Post Primary schools which are participating in the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in the DEIS initiative and which are receiving additional resources, both human and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage have retained these supports for 2006/2007. After that, schools will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">Grant payments amounting to approximately €4.1 million have issued to some 1,900 primary schools, including those that are benefiting from previous schemes, to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage. The grants paid ranged from €70 to €150 per eligible pupil and are based on schools' level of  disadvantage relative to other schools as identified by the new identification process.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_546">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_2089">Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission), Military Service Allowance (MSA) was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990.   As I have previously indicated to the House, this approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">More recently, the Final Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was published in January 2001, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission's Report was the first comprehensive examination of public service occupational pension arrangements since the foundation of the State.   The Commission was an independent body and had invited submissions from interested parties through advertisements in the national press in September 1996, giving those concerned an unprecedented opportunity to put their case on occupational pension issues.  I understand that groups representative of military pensioners were among those who made submissions and were met by the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">In its Report, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances (including the MSA) and the consequences for public service pensioners generally.  However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with longstanding public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the Commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned.  Aside from pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the other groups affected include certain retired members of An Garda Síochána and the Prison Service and retired teachers.  In the context of the Government's subsequent consideration of the Commission's Report, no change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised or is contemplated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">At present, there are 9,727 persons in receipt of pensions under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes (including some 1,440 spouses of deceased personnel).  About 3,630 of these are pre-August 1990 pensioners who do not qualify for the MSA in their pension.  The direct cost to my Department of extending the benefit of MSA to them is currently estimated at €6.85 million a year.  While the number of pensioners affected is slowly falling each year — the corresponding figure this time last year was about 3,770 — the cost involved remains significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">However, the position of these Defence Forces pensioners cannot be looked at in isolation and the question of cost implications for the wider public service must be considered.  In this regard, the Pensions Commission indicated in its Final Report that it had obtained actuarial advice on the impact of making certain allowances (including MSA) pensionable in the specific case of Garda and Defence Forces' pensioners for future pension payments only.  The Commission was advised that, at 1997 costs, this would result in an immediate increase in expenditure of €11.4 million a year and that the accrued liabilities of the State would increase by €147.3 million if this change were implemented for both groups.  The reality therefore is that any departure from established pensions policy for one group would give rise to significant cost repercussions in other areas of the public service.  Accordingly, there is no scope for departing from settled public service pensions policy in the case of MSA.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2095">The new house grant scheme was terminated in 2003 to concentrate housing programmes on areas of greatest impact and social need.  It is not proposed to reintroduce the grant.  However, through overall increases in supply, and increasing output under various affordable housing initiatives, the Government are seeking to improve access to home ownership for first time buyers.  These targeted measures, in particular, assist low income purchasers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">This is a better means of improving the affordability of house purchase and using available resources effectively, than a general first time buyer grant which would over time become absorbed into the house price.  Other general measures are in place through the tax system to assist first time buyers, such as stamp duty concessions and mortgage interest relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">There is evidence of strong activity at present by first time buyers in the market.  It is estimated that 45% of new house loans in 2005 were taken out by first time buyers.  In addition, the average age of Irish first time buyers in 2005 was 30.  Over half of these purchasers were aged 29 or under. This compares with a corresponding average age in the United Kingdom of 34.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">In 2002, prior to termination of the grant, it is estimated there were 33,000 first time buyers; however only 10,500 or about 1/3 of those drew down the grant.  If the scheme was reintroduced at this stage it is likely, assuming a similar ratio of first time buyers qualify that the annual cost would be in the order of close to €40 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">The Government will continue to prioritise effective action to maintain current high levels of supply in the housing market and in particular, will accelerate measures to assist those who cannot access affordable housing without assistance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2114">The National Climate Change Strategy proposed implementation of a system of fuel economy labelling for new cars and the monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions rates for all newly registered cars. Since August 2001, national Regulations require all new passenger cars for sale to be individually labelled with fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions information.  This labelling requirement is in accordance with the relevant annex to EU Directive 1999/94/EC relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">Furthermore, the Regulations require the display of a poster detailing the official fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of all models for sale, the inclusion of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions data on all promotional material and the production of a fuel economy guide by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry outlining the fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions of all makes and models of new passenger cars offered for sale or lease in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2116">A report on implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy, Ireland's Pathway to Kyoto Compliance, which was published in July 2006 for public consultation, proposed that public awareness of the carbon dioxide emissions from each vehicle model might be increased through a redesign of the existing fuel economy label.  I will consider final decisions in relation to this proposal in light of submissions received.</p>

This approval represented a significant increase in funding for these services by the Department from €114,300 in 2005 to €215,838 in 2006.</p>

The main aims and objectives of the scheme are to improve the standard of the existing building stock and foster a "living" urban environment within the five cities of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  My Department's involvement with the scheme relates primarily to the issue of a Certificate of Reasonable Cost where the house meets the conditions and standards as set out in my Department's Explanatory Memoranda HA1 and HA2R.  The details supplied with the Question do not permit my Department to identify whether a Certificate of Reasonable Cost has been applied for or granted in the case of the property concerned. Entitlement to tax relief is, dependant on compliance with certain requirements of tax legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2347">The Local Government Act 2001 has been designed to provide a modern legislative  framework for all local authorities. Under the Act all town councils, including former town commissioners, may take action to promote the community interest; exercise a representational role, with an office of mayor and structured linkage to the county council; provide local amenities and raise a local community contribution; make local bye laws and have statutory input to the local development plan process under the planning code. Under Section 185 of the 2001 Act, which sets out the provisions for the establishment of new town councils, the powers of new town councils would correspond to those of former town commissioners and any proposal for expanded powers would require amending legislation.  Certain town councils, other than former town commissioners, are under the relevant statutory service codes responsible for certain mainline functions in the housing, roads and sanitary services areas. The Oireachtas in its comprehensive review and restatement of local government legislative powers in recent years did not extend responsibility for such mainline functions to additional town councils. Amending legislation would be required to give expanded powers to existing town councils.  I am considering the steps necessary to commence the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act in respect of new town councils and I am in discussion with local government interests in this regard, as the opportunities arise. I continue to keep the position under review, while consolidating progress on quality customer service measures, with the aim of ensuring good accessible local government service delivery for all towns.</p>

            <p eId="para_2803">Under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 money paid as development contributions can only be applied as capital for public infrastructure and facilities.  Circular Letter PD 4/2003, issued by my Department on 27 June 2003, advised that as such they cannot be used to pay current costs. The circular also advised that refurbishment, upgrading, enlargement or replacement of existing infrastructure should only be produced from development contributions where they involve adding value to a network, rather than simply the maintenance of a network that already exists.</p>

            <p eId="para_2805">The data requested are set out in the attached table and is derived from local authority 2005 Annual Financial Statements. Capital account debt includes mortgage-related debt and non-mortgage debt; mortgage related loans, although classified as debts, are matched by the income stream from repayments of individual borrowers. Overdrafts are used to fund temporary cash deficits in respect of both capital and revenue services. Borrowing by local authorities must be sanctioned by the appropriate Minister and, in each case, such sanction is conditional on the local authority being able to meet the loan repayments. In light of the control processes currently in operation prior to sanctioning loans, no further action has been necessary in relation to the level of loans raised by local authorities. The Needs and Resources Model is used for the distribution of general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund. In calculating allocations, the model takes into account all current expenditure by local authorities including expenditure on loan repayments.</p>
