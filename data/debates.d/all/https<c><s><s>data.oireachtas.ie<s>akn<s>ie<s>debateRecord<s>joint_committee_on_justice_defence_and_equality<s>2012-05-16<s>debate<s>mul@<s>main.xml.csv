#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Apologies have been received from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, for whom Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh will attend in substitution.  Senator Denis O'Donovan has been discharged from the committee and Senator Katherine Zappone has been appointed to replace him.  There are three items on today's agenda.  We will first discuss with the Minister a motion from the Dáil regarding an agreement between the European Union and the USA on the use and transfer of passenger name records, PNR, to the US Department of Homeland Security.  This will be followed by a discussion with the Minister on the independent report into matters related to the deaths of Corporal Fintan Heneghan, Private Mannix Armstrong and Private Thomas Walsh in Lebanon on 21 March 1989.  Our final discussion with the Minister will be on the review of the Reserve Defence Force.  Briefing documents have been circulated to members.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I welcome the Minister and his officials.  We will first have a briefing from the Minister on the agreement between the European Union and USA, followed by a question and answer session.  The same procedure will apply to the second and third items.  The motion moved in the Dáil reads as follows:That the proposal that Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to accept the following measure:the Council Decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of Passenger Name Records to the United States Department of Homeland Security,a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 6th December, 2011, be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, in accordance with Standing Order 82A(4)(j), which, not later than 24th May, 2012, shall send a message to the Dáil in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 87, and Standing Order 86(2) shall accordingly apply.I invite the Minister to brief the joint committee on the agreement.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The motion before the joint committee is to enable Ireland to participate in the agreement between the European Union and the United States on the use and transfer of passenger name records, PNR, to the United States Department of Homeland Security, which has been adopted by the Council of Ministers.  I propose that Ireland should exercise the option provided by Article 4 of Protocol 21 to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to accept a measure after it has been adopted by the Council.  The prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required to enable Ireland to exercise this option.It is my view that sensible measures which can give law enforcement authorities an advantage in the fight against serious crime and terrorism are to be welcomed and deserve support.  This agreement replaces the current EU-US agreement on passenger name records which has been operation since 2007.  The agreement has been renegotiated to address concerns that had been raised about proportionality, data protection and data security aspects.  A new agreement was established to cover the ongoing use and transfer of PNR data to the United States authorities.  It was signed on 14 December 2011 and sent to the European Parliament, which considered it in detail.  The terms of the agreement were improved by the Parliament on 19 April 2012 and it was then concluded by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at its meeting on 26 April last.PNR data are information about passengers' travel plans that are collected and held by air carriers as part of their reservation systems.  The agreement will require the airlines to provide a portion of the information they collect to the US authorities for the purpose of combating terrorism and serious transnational crime.  PNR is a tool of proven value to law enforcement services in counter-terrorism and serious crime investigations, especially in cases of trafficking in drugs and persons.  A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Spain, the United States and Australia, have been using PNR data for some years for these purposes.PNR data have been of benefit in cracking a number of significant transnational organised crime cases.  For example, the UK authorities targeted and successfully prosecuted a Chinese gang of human traffickers bringing illegal immigrants into the UK and Ireland through other EU states.  The use of PNR data was key in identifying the passengers and linking them to the trafficking facilitators.The use of PNR data was instrumental in the prosecution and conviction of David Headley for involvement in the atrocious terrorist attacks in Mumbai in India in November 2008 in which 164 innocent people lost their lives.  By entering details of the suspect's first name, his partial travel itinerary and a possible travel window into the PNR database David Headley's full name, address and passport number were obtained.  He was subsequently arrested and pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges.While this measure is an important support to the fight against terrorism and serious crime I am very conscious of the need to ensure the rights of citizens are not subjected to unnecessary or disproportionate intrusion.  It is important to strike an appropriate balance, particularly with regard to the protection of personal data and I believe this agreement does just that.  The agreement provides that all air carriers operating flights between the EU and the US will continue to transmit certain PNR data for passengers flying to or from the US.  The agreement contains a number of specific safeguards with regard to the use of PNR data, particularly strictly limiting the processing of the data to the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious transnational crime.  These offences are defined in the agreement, including by reference to existing EU legal instruments already in force.  Furthermore, the agreement sets out clearly a series of detailed provisions relating to data retention, protection and security.I will not take up the committee's time describing all of the provisions in detail as I am sure members will have read the proposal.  With regard to the retention periods, the PNR data will be retained by US authorities for up to five years in what is known as an active database with restrictions on access.  After the first six months the PNR data will be depersonalised, that is to say the fields which would identify an individual would be masked out.  After the initial five year period the depersonalised data will be transferred to an inactive database with additional access restrictions.  In the case of terrorist offences and related crimes the data may then be retained for up to a further ten years, that is to say for a total of 15 years.  In the case of serious transnational crimes the data can be retained for a further five years, that is to say for a total of ten years.I draw attention to the specific safeguards with regard to privacy, data protection and security, oversight, accountability, transparency, the right of access to information and the correction of errors and redress.  Members should note that under the terms of the agreement an individual has the right to access his or her own data, to have incorrect data corrected and to redress for violation of his or her rights under the agreement.  It is also noteworthy that the agreement provides that the safeguards which are in place in the US for privacy and data protection are available to all individuals regardless of nationality, country of origin or place of residence.  The agreement also provides for regular joint review of its operation by EU and US authorities and for joint evaluation of the agreement four years after its entry into force.  The agreement will remain in force for a period of seven years.This proposal is one of a number of measures being taken at EU level in the justice and home affairs field which arise from commitments set out in the 2009 Stockholm programme.  The Government is determined that Ireland will have full, active and constructive engagement in bringing forward the European justice agenda given the potential value of PNR data in investigations into drug smuggling, human trafficking or international terrorism.  Given the importance of giving a clear demonstration of our continued support for and solidarity with the international community in the fight against these activities I recommend Ireland's participation in this particular measure.  I have no doubt the majority of members will share this view and I commend the motion to the committee.

We will support this measure when it comes to the main House.  If anybody needed reminding of the threat that still faces airline travel we had the incident in the United States last week, and this type of measure is to protect all of us . With regard to the ability of an individual to access his or her own data will the Minister outline how this can happen?  What agency will a person use to access this information?  Will there be a fee to seek information and what will be the turnaround time?  If the information retained contains a difficulty or discrepancy what right of appeal or correction does a citizen have?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I refer the Deputy to Article 11 of the measure which deals with the issue of access for individuals.  Paragraph 1 states that in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, any individual, regardless of nationality, country of origin, or place of residence is entitled to request his or her PNR data and it must be provided in a timely manner.  Article 11 also states disclosure of information contained in PNR may be subject to reasonable legal limitations, applicable under US law, including any limitations that may be necessary to safeguard privacy.  Any refusal or restriction of access must be set forth in writing and provided to the requesting individual on a timely basis.  Such notification will include the legal basis on which information was withheld and shall inform the individual of the available options under US law for seeking redress.  As I understand it the information is disclosed only to the individual concerned who seeks the information.  Article 12 makes provision for the correction of this information when correction must be made to it.

Yesterday I came across the case of an innocent man who was kidnapped by the CIA, brought off and tortured and eventually released, but who could not press charges against the US Government because of changes in legislation in the United States.  Do the Department and the Minister have an uncritical view of this?  Does the Minister accept people in the State will keep a very close eye on big powers such as the US?  Does the Minister have concerns about the use of Shannon Airport and the human rights issues raised there by many of my colleagues?

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I am concerned about ensuring maximum co-operation between this State, EU member states and the United States in fighting terrorism and organised crime.  There is a need to recognise the internationalisation of serious crime.  There are no real borders in the minds of those engaged in international crime and terrorism.  We have seen appalling atrocities committed by people engaged in terrorism, from the appalling atrocities of 11 September 2001 to the events in Mumbai to which I made reference.  We have a duty and an obligation to ensure we co-operate with other states in the provision of information that will either prevent such atrocities or ensure where they occur that they are adequately investigated and information is made available.  The proposal before the committee is balanced and measured and has been subject to detailed examination by the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the elected Members of the European Parliament.  I am satisfied it is an appropriate measure.  I believe it is important we protect the human rights of innocent individuals who want to go about their lives without fear of bombs exploding or aircraft being used as weapons.We have an obligation to protect individuals who are exploited by human traffickers.  We also have an obligation to ensure that in the event of women being trafficked so that their bodies might be sold for sexual purposes and to the benefit of those who control them, adequate co-operative investigations can take place on an international and transnational basis.  I find it extraordinary that Deputy McGrath would use this committee, as he has frequently done, for the usual anti-American diatribe without giving any recognition of any description or nature-----

If Deputy McGrath wishes to present it as something different by raising issues that are totally extraneous to the particular measure, he is free to do so.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	19	My question, which the Minister refused to answer, was whether he had concerns about the human rights record of the USA.  I provided examples of the issue.  My point has nothing to do with the broad support by the House for tackling human trafficking and international violence and terrorism.  Many open-minded people have concerns about the human rights record of this major power.  My question was simple, yet the Minister fudged it as usual.  He was selective in his answer.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Through the Chair, please.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I understand that we are dealing with this issue and not a general issue about the human rights record of the US or any other country.  I am dealing with the matter that is on the agenda of the committee.  If the Deputy wishes to have a general discussion on foreign policy and human rights issues, I would be happy as the Minister for Justice and Equality over the Department with responsibility for human rights issues in this State to engage in that area.  However, this is a specific, discrete issue that we are dealing with today.  I find it surprising and very interesting that the Deputy is incapable of expressing any support for this measure or of recognising its benefits to people throughout this country and to people in the rest of Europe as an instrument to protect people in Europe, Ireland and the United States by maximising information about matters relating to organised crime and terrorism and by ensuring, as best we can with these sorts of co-operative instruments, the various police and security forces can utilise crucial information to protect communities.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I welcome the Minister.  I apologise in advance, as I must return to the Seanad at 3.30 p.m.  This is an important issue for the committee to debate.  There has been a request in the Upper House that the matter also be debated on the floor of the Seanad if the committee recommends the motion to the Houses.Each of us takes the Minister's point about vigilance, particularly in terms of airport security.  We were all pleased to hear about the need for a balance between the rights of people to be free from terrorist attack and harm and their right to privacy and about the need to ensure adequate safeguards were in place.  Concerns were raised in the European Parliament about safeguards and the length of the data retention periods provided for in this measure.I wish to ask about the safeguards, a matter referred to in Articles 5 and 6 of the Council decision.  What is entailed in oversight?  Article 5(4) provides that the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, would inform the relevant European authorities about cases of significant privacy incidents.  Is there any comeback from European authorities?  Article 6 addresses the point of sensitive data.  This is the area in which privacy rights are most likely to be involved, in that personal data or information can be included within the passenger name record, PNR.  I presume this would be a relatively rare occurrence.  In such a situation, the DHS would employ automated systems to filter out and mask sensitive data.  The European Commission has a role under Article 6(2) in monitoring this masking and filtering.  Is there a mechanism for the European Commission to revert to the DHS when it believes masking and filtering has not been conducted?  That provision may be contained elsewhere in the document.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Yes.  To be of assistance to the Senator, Article 19 relates to the implementation and final provisions.  It reads:In consideration of this Agreement and its implementation, DHS shall be deemed to provide, within the meaning of relevant EU data protection law, an adequate level of protection for PNR processing and use.  In this respect, carriers which have provided PNR to DHS in compliance with this Agreement shall be deemed to have complied with applicable legal requirements in the EU related to the transfer of such data from the EU to the United States.There is also a provision on a review of how matters are working in the context of dealing with data, namely, Article 23, entitled "Review and Evaluation".  It reads:The Parties shall jointly review the implementation of this Agreement one year after its entry into force and regularly thereafter as jointly agreed.  Further, the Parties shall jointly evaluate this Agreement four years after its entry into force.It is envisaged that there will be ongoing co-operation between the relevant authorities in Europe and the United States to monitor and review the workings of the system.What are relevant in all of this are issues surrounding the retention of data and the form in which they are retained.  These particular issues gave rise to substantial discussion at European Parliament level and within the Council of Ministers.  The DHS will retain PNR data in an active database for up to five years.  I made reference to this in my speech at the commencement.  I stated that, after the first six months of this period, the data are depersonalised by masking out aspects that could identify an individual.  In practical terms, this relatively short period in which the data will be fully available was considered an important protection for personal data and privacy terms.  The depersonalisation is not permanent at this point, however, and the personal aspects may be unmasked where needed for specific investigations, prosecutions or threats.  Access to it is restricted to a limited number of specifically authorised officials.  There is a range with regard to dealing with data.  For a period, they are available in a particular manner and then they are retained in a manner in which the identities of those to whom they apply are generally masked out but can, in very specific and particular circumstances, be made available to a limited number of individuals.  Thereafter, the data are transferred to a dormant database.  Only in particular circumstances, which are basically cases of terrorist offences or very serious transnational crimes, can they be accessed.It is important to say to members of the committee that, in working through the provisions of this arrangement, there was substantial discussion and negotiation with a view to ensuring, firstly, that, where necessary, inaccurate information could be corrected and, secondly, that the information would be retained in a general database for a limited period of time and thereafter would only be available to a discrete number of authorised individuals in particularly serious circumstances.  This effectively summarises it.The other article that is relevant is Article 8(6), which reads: "The Parties agree that, within the framework of the evaluation as provided for in Article 23(1), the necessity of a 10-year dormant period of retention will be considered".  That is something that is effectively up for review at a later point as well.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Does Deputy Ó Snodaigh wish to ask a question?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	25	A number of questions.  I have attended committee meetings under previous Governments at which we dealt with PNRs.  They were initially debated in 2007, when the scheme was more flawed.  There are still major questions about this, which is basically a data retention and sharing regime.  One of the key problems is that the protections for data retained do not fall under the same harmonised protection process.  For example, in one jurisdiction there may be very stringent data protection criteria that may not be equalled in another jurisdiction.  I note the comments to Senator Bacik on the periods of six months and five years before removal to a dormant database.  Nevertheless, databases, by definition, can be accessed.  In the United States, legislation around homeland security supersedes most legislation so there is nothing preventing data which is supposedly depersonalised or held in a dormant database being extracted by an agency in America to use at will.  The same would apply in other countries, so this is not an attack on the systems of the United States.  It does not have the same protections as most European countries with regard to data retention.One of the other key concerns I had over the years relates to the sharing of information.  If a mistake is spotted - for example, if a person's data is inaccurate - how could it be guaranteed that the data would be corrected thereafter?  Once the data is passed to another member state or country, it is out of the hands of the originating country, and although a nation can try to ensure the record is corrected, there is no guarantee that would happen.Given the level of international crime and increasing globalisation, we need greater co-operation, although it should not come with the loss of protection through interference with people's privacy.  The "nothing to hide, nothing to fear" argument should not be used just to force through measures; it is not just this but other unnecessarily intrusive processes affecting data and rights to privacy.  The original proposal we dealt with failed, as the scope was extended, with discussion of custodial sentences.  I am thankful we have seen some sense in that regard.  Nevertheless, the process is still flawed as the guarantees do not exist and we should not create legal vacuums where unaccountable intelligence agencies have more say than nations in the rights of people.Are we approaching the end of these proposals or will they extend beyond air travel?  There have been suggestions the process will extend to people travelling via ferry or between countries by tunnel or train.  There is the Channel tunnel between Britain and the rest of Europe.  Will this directive result in passengers being subjected to more extensive tracking, tracing and screening than with the current regimes?When the Commission put forward this proposal, it was indicated that it was required to tackle international crime.  The Minister listed some of the horrendous crimes that he hopes this will address but there has been no evidence of the usefulness of collecting this data over and above other preventative and intelligence-gathering measures employed by nations' police forces.  I have not attended these committee meetings in recent months but has there been any new evidence or reports justifying the usefulness of this directive, which is a major change in the retention of personal data in Europe?  Will this process comply with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly as they relate to the protection of privacy and data?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Deputy asked a series of questions and I might take them in reverse order as the later questions can be more succinctly answered.  This complies with the European Convention on Human Rights and there is no issue in that regard.  Passengers will not be subject to any more extensive disclosure of information than they are now, and this provision is better than the one that has been there since 2007.  It provides greater protection for individuals with regard to information issues compared to what was the case in the past.The Deputy asked if this would be successful and the Deputy was not here when I referred to the investigation into the dreadful atrocity in Mumbai, and how access to passenger name record information led to identifying the individual who committed the atrocity.  Once identified, the individual acknowledged responsibility for the atrocity.  There are various examples of passenger name records in action and being successfully used.  In August 2009, the research of this data linked to an ongoing human trafficking investigation identified pending travel of an individual with an Interpol red notice for trafficking women from eastern Europe.  The Department of Homeland Security co-ordinated with Interpol and the subject was interdicted during travel from the Dominican Republic.  Research of passenger name records associated with this individual led to the identification of five previously unidentified eastern European human trafficking victims, based on the form of airline ticket payment, address and e-mail in the passenger information.  Additional research identified three additional subjects suspected of being involved with the trafficking of human beings for the purpose of prostitution.I referred previously in a reply to Deputy McGrath to the usefulness in the context of such operations.  On 22 June 2010, there was US-EU co-operation when the Department of Homeland Security identified a Nigerian travelling from Dallas to John F. Kennedy Airport to London who was suspected of being a narcotics courier.  The Department of Homeland Security was unable to interdict the individual in New York but shared the individual's passenger name information with UK border agencies.  Upon arrival, the individual was detained, admitted to swallowing 60 pellets of cocaine and was arrested before pleading guilty to narcotics smuggling.  There is a series of additional examples showing the usefulness of this system in providing protection for communities and co-operation between law enforcement agencies across the world in seeking to ensure that those who engage in international criminality are apprehended.Other queries were raised.  I refer the Deputy to Article 13 because his first question was in the context of legislation by the United States.  The Department of Homeland Security does not effectively have overriding powers over everything.  The Department of Homeland Security has very substantial powers and I will not pretend that I have expertise in all of its areas of legislation.  It has very substantial powers to address a broad range of areas in the United States, particularly dealing with terrorism, counter-terrorism and international criminality issues that create risks to the United States.  It does not have a free run to violate an international agreement.  This is an international agreement between the European Union and the United States which is subject to monitoring and review by the European and the United States.  This is an agreement whose terms have to be complied with.From an individual's perspective, Article 13 and following articles, of the US legislation, are particularly relevant as follows:Article 13: Redress for Individuals1. Any individual regardless of nationality, country of origin, or place of residence whose personal data and personal information has been processed and used in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement can seek effective administrative and judicial redress in accordance with U.S. law.2. Any individual is entitled to seek to administratively challenge DHS decision related to the use and processing of PNR.3. Under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law, any individual is entitled to petition for a judicial review in U.S. federal court of any final agency action by DHS.  Further, any individual is entitled to petition for judicial review in accordance with applicable law and relevant provisions of:(a) the Freedom of Information Act,(b) the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,(c) the Electronic Communications Privacy Act; and(d) other political provisions of U.S. law.4. In particular, DHS provides all individuals an administrative means (currently the DH Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS, TRIP) to resolve travel-related inquiries including those related to the use of PNR.  DHS TRIP provides a redress process for individuals who believe that they have been delayed or prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft because they were wrongly identified as a threat.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act and Title 49, United States Code, Section 46110, any such aggrieved individual is entitled to petition for judicial review in U.S. federal court.The following oversight provisions in Article 14 are particularly important:Article 14: Oversight1.  Compliance with the privacy safeguards in this Agreement shall be subject to independent review and oversight by Department Privacy officers, such as DHS Chief Privacy Officer, who:(a) have a proven record of autonomy;(b) exercise effective powers of oversight, investigation, intervention and review; and(c) have the power to refer violations of law related to this Agreement for prosecution or disciplinary action, when appropriate.They shall, in particular, ensure that complaints relating to non-compliance with this Agreement are received, investigated, responded to, and appropriately redressed.  These complaints may be brought by any individual, regardless of nationality, country of origin, or place of residence.An important aspect of this is contained in subparagraph 2 and it states:2. In addition, application of this Agreement by the United States shall be subject to independent review and oversight by one or more of the following entities:(a) the DHS Office of Inspector General;(b) the Government Accountability Office as established by Congress;(c) the U.S. Congress.Such oversight may be manifested in findings and recommendations of public reports, public hearings, and analyses.I want to particularly emphasise the last few words "of public reports, public hearings, and analyses."There is, in the context of this particular agreement, extensive provision designed to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected.  They are copper-fastened by the review process that the European Union can engage in on an annualised, effective basis.  Of course, if this agreement was abused that information could immediately be given by any individual, so affected, to a Member State of the European Union, to the European Parliament or the relevant committee of the European Parliament that focusses on justice related issues.  There is a broad range of protections in place which are detailed in the architecture of the agreement designed to address the concerns that the Deputy, quite properly, raised.  They are genuine issues that deserve to be raised and discussed and the oversight provision is particularly important.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Sorry, Deputy.  This agreement only applies to air travel.  There was some discussion during the course of the deliberation on the agreement as to whether there should be a similar provision that extends beyond air travel.  Is the Deputy talking about the objective of the legislation in the context of travel by sea, for example?  It would make some sense to have similar arrangements in place.  One has the adequate protection, by providing for this for air travel but not for other types of travel, where it would be practical.  There is not an instrument at the moment addressing or that puts in place a similar measure in the context of sea travel.  I presume the perspective is that primarily those engaged in criminality like to travel to locations with some speed and that air travel offers that.  Certainly, if one was the Nigerian gentleman who had consumed 60 pellets of cocaine one would not necessarily want to be at sea for two weeks travelling across an ocean from one side of the world to another to effect one's delivery.  The perspective, I think, is essentially in the area of air travel where there is the greatest need.  Certainly, at some future date, it may be considered in other contexts.  This instrument does not apply to any other context.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	34	On 19 December 2011, I published the review of Mr. Frank Callanan, SC, into matters relevant to the deaths of Corporal Fintan Heneghan, Private Mannix Armstrong and Private Thomas Walsh.  They died tragically on 21 March 1989 while serving with "C" Company, 64th Infantry Battalion, United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon.I appointed Mr. Callanan in April 2011 to carry out the inquiry following the emergence of new evidence in the course of preparation of a legal case.  I know that members of their families are here today and I have already said hello to them.  I would again like to take this opportunity, like the Chairman and Members, to express my sincere sympathies to the families of Corporal Heneghan, Private Armstrong and Private Walsh on their tragic loss.Corporal Heneghan, Private Armstrong and Private Walsh had been tasked on a detail to collect rocks for the constructing and enhancement of stone gabions around the camp at Bra'shit.  These rocks were being collected in an area called the Green Rooms.  As their vehicle was returning from this mission it drove over a landmine which detonated, causing the tragic deaths of all three men.  At the time, the official UN board of inquiry found that there was no reason to believe there was any breach of the existing rules as laid down in the Irishbatt standard operating procedures.  It further concluded that no UNIFIL personnel could be made responsible for the accident.From very shortly after the tragedy some family members and colleagues raised concerns that issues arose relating to the deaths of the three men.  These issues included an assertion that the track to the Green Rooms was out of bounds.  These issues were raised both by way of legal proceedings and representations to the Minister for Defence over the years.  My predecessor, former Deputy Michael Smith, appointed a senior official in 2003 to examine statements provided by the families from colleagues of the deceased.  Following examination of the contents of these statements and consultations with the military authorities and the Office of the Attorney General on the issues raised, it was determined that a further inquiry was unlikely to come to an alternative view to that in the United Nations board report.However, in 2011 new information came to light in the context of preparing for a legal action.  This information, which had not been available previously, was significant and substantive in nature and related to deficiencies in the threat assessment and, therefore, the assessed level of threat pertaining in the mission area.  Once this new information was brought to my attention, I determined that it warranted the carrying out of an independent review.  I arranged for the families to be informed immediately of this decision and I appointed Mr. Frank Callanan, SC, to conduct the review.  The review encompassed both a review of all relevant documents and interviews with such persons as considered appropriate by Mr. Callanan.  In this regard, Mr. Callanan received a warrant which allowed him access to all personnel, facilities and documentation as he deemed appropriate in the context of his review.  Mr. Callanan notes in his report that all those he  interviewed, both serving and former members of the Defence Forces, co-operated conscientiously and truthfully with his review.Mr. Callanan completed his review and presented his report to me in September 2011.  I thank him for the excellent and comprehensive report he produced.  It is clear from his report that the Defence Forces engaged in the UN mission in Lebanon at that time, were facing a very complex and difficult mission with limited resources.  The report concludes that there was a systemic failure, not alone by the Defence Forces but by the UNIFIL mission as a whole, to respond to the increased threat from improvised explosive devices, lEDs, and from the danger of an attack by armed Islamic elements.  For the information of the committee I would like to put on the record the specific findings from the report, which are as follows:1. Given prior events, there was a deficient assessment of the threat confronting the 64th Infantry Battalion in UNIFIL both from lEDs and landmines placed by the Lebanese Resistance in the Irish Battalion Area of Operations and from the danger of a targeted attack by radical Islamic armed elements on the Irish Battalion, and a failure to adopt appropriate Force protection measures;2. The three deceased soldiers should not have been sent from Company Headquarters up the track where they met their deaths in a landmine explosion without the track being first cleared for lEDs and landmines;3. The procedures for checking for the presence of lEDs and landmines were insufficiently defined and applied.  The training of the soldiers of the 64th Battalion in relation to the threat of lEDs was deficient;4. The track on which the three deceased soldiers met their deaths had not been placed out of bounds either by the erection of a roadside sign or otherwise, and did not lie within the Israeli Controlled Area of South Lebanon.  This had been an issue for the families.I met with the families and extended to them, on behalf of the Government, an apology for the failure to fully recognise by early 1989 the implications of the changed circumstances in the Defence Forces mission area in southern Lebanon and for the deaths of their loved ones.  It can never be absolutely certain that their loved ones would have been saved if the Defence Forces had adopted a higher risk posture and appropriate protection measures, but it must be accepted that appropriate procedures could possibly have avoided this tragedy.I believe that the Defence Forces have learned from the failure in this instance to undertake an adequate threat assessment and thus deploy appropriate force protection assets.  I wish to reassure the families of Defence Forces personnel currently serving overseas that the issue of force protection is taken extremely seriously and that the military authorities deploy all necessary assets to protect our personnel, wherever they  operate.  In  addition, threat assessments are constantly reviewed in light of changing circumstances and incidents having regard to the protection of our forces.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I, too, welcome the families.  The Minister and I disagree on many things but the Minister's personal interest in this since his appointment to office is commendable.  However, for 23 years before that, both the Defence Forces and the Department were not quite as commendable.  It is extraordinary that after 22 years information that completely changes the entire approach of the Department and the Army suddenly became available.  In an investigation that was supposed to have been carried out by UNIFIL, the United Nations, the Army, the Department of Defence and the Attorney General every aspect of this incident was supposed to have been investigated.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, this information came to light.  I do not know if the Minister is in a position to do so but could he elaborate on the nature of that information, the manner in which it was found after 22 years and whether it came from within the Defence Forces or from the UN?Second, with regard to the findings which the Minister quoted in his remarks, I have difficulty with a systematic failure being blamed for the entire incident.  If it was a private organisation, that could be defended and examined.  However, this is the military, with a command and control structure.  Somebody gives orders and somebody takes orders.  Those taking the orders must have confidence in those who are giving orders and that the orders will be safe.  On this occasion, that confidence unfortunately caused the death of three people.  The Minister said there was a deficient assessment of the threat confronting the 64th Infantry Battalion.  Who was responsible for putting that assessment in place?  Was it the United Nations, UNIFIL or somebody in the Irish Army?  The Minister said there was not appropriate force protection.  Again, who was responsible for that?The difficulty with putting it down to a systematic failure is that it blames everybody, that is, the culture and everybody who was there that day, and that is patently not the case.  Those who went out to do their job did so in the hope that everything was in place, when clearly it was not.  The difficulty with nobody being held responsible, and I am not looking for heads to be chopped off, is that this could happen again and nobody would be held responsible again.  It would be put down to a systematic failure.  When people are not held responsible in an organisation, there is the danger of something happening again.  There is also the issue of the track not being cleared.  The families and the colleagues still contend that there was a sign on the road that day warning people not to use the road.  This continues to be a matter of division.  Was it the UN or the Irish Defence Forces who sent the personnel on that mission that morning without ensuring the track had been cleared first?RTE representatives were being kicked around this committee room in the course of another committee meeting this morning, and justifiably so.  However, RTE has done the families in this case a service through the documentary by Seán O'Rourke in 2001 called "Brothers in Arms".  I recommend that everybody look at it.  A senior Army officer told Seán O'Rourke that night that the road was cleared ahead of the patrol heading out that morning.  Now Mr. Callanan, whom I also praise, has said it was not cleared.  Why did the Army contend that the road was cleared and in doing so, place the blame on colleagues of the three members of the Defence Forces who were killed?  What information changed its assessment of that?  What was the practice at the time, to clear tracks before people went out on patrol or to collect materials?  This seems to be a failure in the command structure of the mission.  The danger of putting it down to systematic failure is that we go back and, God forbid, this could happen again, although thankfully it has not in the past 23 years.The Minister and the Army have apologised to the families.  The colleagues of the men who were there on the day, however, have not had an apology yet.  They witnessed the event and its aftermath and some of them were in some way blamed afterwards.  Through the years those colleagues and their families have had to fight a lonely fight to get to this point.  That fight included former members of the Defence Forces, people who put their lives on the line for this country, getting letters asking them to desist from corresponding with the Army about this issue.  As late as May 2010, former colleagues were requested to cease their correspondence with the Defence Forces in letters signed by a very senior member of the armed forces.  Had they desisted, we would not be here today and Mr. Callanan's report would not have been issued.  The colleagues who were there on the day deserve an apology, particularly for the way those who tried to follow the truth were treated.Has the Minister corresponded with the United Nations about the new correspondence?  It has completely changed the view of the Department and the view of the military.  Does the new information have implications for the manner in which it conducted its investigation in 1989-90?  The Minister included UNIFIL in the systematic failures.  What was the UNIFIL response to its inclusion, bearing in mind my concerns about that excuse?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I thank the Deputy for raising the various issues he has raised.  This was an issue of great stress to the families and colleagues of the three deceased members of our Defence Forces for many years.  I went through the history of the inquiries in my opening statement and I will not delay the committee by repeating what was said.  The appointment of Mr. Callanan was effected within four to five weeks of my assuming the position of Minister for Defence.  I was conscious of the background to the matter.  Although I had not personally previously met with the families, I was aware of issues surrounding this event.The Deputy asked how information became available.  There was a pending court case and it became available in the context of key evidence becoming available as a consequence of those who would have been called to give evidence in the court case furnishing evidence that was not known prior to that event.  I do not know why this was not previously known; I was only four or five weeks in the Department and I had a number of predecessors in that position in the preceding years.  Effectively the information that became available was key evidence from Commandant Lane that gave rise to the inquiry.  The information became available that was not clearly available on a paper basis in the context of the review that had taken place some years earlier and clearly was not information that was available in the context of the United Nations original inquiry or, if it was, it was not factored into the outcome.  As soon as the information became available, and I considered its implications, I was of the view that an independent review was essential.  The report goes into the background in great detail.  I am conscious the families and the committee have read it so I will not repeat its contents but that new information that had not been factored into any previous report resulted in the conclusions reached by Mr. Callanan.I hope in circumstances where I acknowledge nothing can be said to rectify the dreadful tragedy, that the information that has become available has provided the families with a greater insight and acknowledgement of what occurred.  The RTE programme, which I saw many years ago, placed substantial emphasis on the area where the tragedy occurred as being a "no go" area and that there were indications that troops should not be there.  That was comprehensively addressed in Frank Callanan's report.  I am aware there are probably still some members of the Defence Forces who would be of the view there was some sort of indication that that area was restricted but he has dealt with this in great detail in his report and expressed the view that it was not the case.I cannot, however, in response to the questions raised, and it would be wrong of me to do so, reassess the conclusions of a very comprehensive report.  The Deputy asked if I could identify an individual who was responsible for what went wrong.  There was clearly a failure to understand the level of threat posed based on previous incidents that had occurred.  That is well documented in the report.  The failure was not a failure of a single individual, rather it was a failure of UNIFIL in the context of its responsibilities at command level and it was a failure within our Defence Forces at that time.  It was not something a lone individual was responsible for.  The report details the incidents that should have given rise to a concern about the level of threat that was posed.  Quite properly, it reaches the conclusion that the area, if it was to be entered, should have been checked prior to entry for IEDs or land mines and that did not happen.I am not in a position to cast any more light than Mr. Callanan has done.  It is important something that has been a genuine cause of concern, inquiry and dispute in circumstances where three members of our Defence Forces lost their lives and where a tragedy occurred we would all prefer that it never had occurred, that we are now at a point where there is a far greater understanding of the background to the events and what happened.  In the context of current practice, the lessons of this dreadful tragedy have been learned.  Everything has been done in recent years and is being done now to ensure threat levels are adequately and properly assessed and that our troops in southern Lebanon at present have all of the protections necessary and all proper procedures are applied in that context.  The report was furnished to the United Nations and we received an acknowledgment.  I am not aware the UN, as an organisation, has revisited the issue and the Department has not received a substantive detailed response from the UN.  I regard the Callanan report as very important in getting to the truth of the background of what occurred.  It was an independent review and members of the Defence Forces who participated in that mission at various levels fully co-operated with Mr. Callanan, which he noted, and discussed issues with him.  I am sure some members of the Defence Forces who were there may have a different perspective on the matter, but this is an independent report by an individual of impeccable integrity.  I hope it has provided some assistance to the families, who have been looking for a very long time for a further report on the dreadful events that happened.

I extend my deepest sympathy to them on the loss of these three young soldiers in this dreadful tragedy.  I take this opportunity to commend our Defence Forces who serve on UN peacekeeping missions.  They do the State a great service and honour.  I know from members of my immediate family in the Defence Forces who have served on UN missions that it is a very difficult job.  We all have a direct interest in this issue.  It is important that the families know that Members of the Oireachtas know these soldiers died for peace, which is very honourable.  We are very proud of them.I welcome the Minister's apology, but as my colleagues, Deputy Dara Calleary said, the families have experienced a great deal of pain and hurt and have had to wait a long time for the report.The Minister spoke about systemic failure, that their training was deficient and that the soldiers should not have gone up the track.  There are two core issues.  First, I hope the families are getting the maximum support from the Minister and the Department.  Second, how do we prevent those types of situations developing in the future?  I know one cannot prevent accidents in a conflict.  Are the safeguards now in place to reduce the chances of a repeat of this happening and will all the recommendations of the report be implemented?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	38	In all deployments, a detailed threat assessment is carried out by the intelligence directorate of the Defence Forces. There is an assessment prior to the deployment of troops to the Lebanon and the threat assessment is kept under constant review while we have troops there.  It incorporates local knowledge and international and UN assessments.  UNIFIL HQ also produces threat assessments.  Our director of intelligence conducts independent assessments from Defence Forces sources to ensure appropriate force protection at all times.  I can assure the Deputy that I have regular sight of reports on threat assessments in areas in which we have troops on UN duty.  These assessments are considered very seriously and there is a constant oversight of where our troops are located, be it in a large contingent of troops such as the current contingent of troops in southern Lebanon or the smaller number of six troops engaged in the UN monitoring group in Syria.  There is constant threat assessment undertaken that is factored into their deployment and their day-to-day engagements and activities.  This is of course of crucial importance.  It is a great tragedy that these three brave individuals who were in the Defence Forces lost their lives.  It is very important that people do not lose their lives through mistakes of a systemic or other nature.The reality is that these missions are dangerous.  We should never underestimate the dangers posed to our troops when engaged in UN missions abroad, even in areas that appear to be relatively stable.  An incident can suddenly flare up, and some group of individuals engaged in terrorist activity or local unrest can behave in a way that places our troops at risk.  We are very conscious of this and there is a great awareness of ensuring that necessary steps are taken.  It is fair to say, without it being in any way a criticism of the past, that training is now more sophisticated and a great deal has been learned about deployment on UN missions.  At UN level there is better communications now than occurred in the past on occasions, without saying that this is an issue in this case.It was very important that this review was conducted, that the information that has come to light was made available to the families and was published.  Of course, this report of itself provides additional learning and insight for the Defence Forces in future missions.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I welcome this opportunity to brief you on the value for money review, VFM, of the Reserve Defence Force.  I understand that the committee may also wish to discuss any developments in the Permanent Defence Force in terms of reducing the number of Army brigades.A value for money review of the Reserve Defence Forces was one of two value for money reviews approved by Government as part of the 2009-11 round of VFM and policy reviews.  The other review focusing on the training of general service recruits in the Permanent Defence Force was scheduled to take place first.  However, given the moratorium on recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force, it was decided, in April 2009, to bring forward the review of the Reserve Defence Force to commence in 2010.In July 2009, the McCarthy report recommended that the strength of the Reserve Defence Force be reduced by two thirds to deliver savings of €5.6 million.  Given the fact that a VFM review was scheduled, the Minister for Defence, at the time, did not implement the strength reduction to approximately 2,500 personnel necessary to achieve the savings from Reserve Defence Force pay and allowances as recommended.  I understand the savings were found elsewhere in the Vote, including reducing the levels of paid training to members of the Reserve.In accordance with the appropriate guidelines, a steering committee was established to oversee the review and an independent chairperson, drawn from a panel established for this purpose by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was appointed.  The steering committee commenced its work in February 2010, supported by a working group of civil servants and military personnel.  This included a small number of personnel with specialised evaluation expertise.  In 2010 priorities arose that required the diversion of these limited resources away from the review of the Reserve Defence Force.  First, the implementation of the then Government's National Recovery Plan and subsequently, in 2011, undertaking the comprehensive review of expenditure.As these reviews encompassed the entire Defence Vote they effectively overtook the review of the Reserve Defence Force and resources were assigned accordingly.  Work on data gathering and analysis for the review of the Reserve did continue, where feasible, during 2011 but was not sufficient to require a steering committee meeting.  The Chair was kept informed of developments.It is worth noting that as part of its comprehensive review of expenditure assessment, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's central evaluation unit recommended abolishing the Reserve Defence Force.  The Department of Defence comprehensive review assessment recommended no further cuts to the Reserve pending the outcome of the VFM review.  Accordingly, the budget for Reserve training was not reduced in 2012.Arising from the Government's decision to reduce the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force to 9,500 personnel, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, encompassing a reduction in the number of Permanent Defence Force Army brigades from three to two.  I tasked the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff to prepare this re-organisation and work is ongoing in that regard.  As the Army Reserve is organised along similar lines to the PDF and supported by PDF personnel, the re-organisation must also have a direct bearing on the Reserve.  Had the report of the value for money review been completed before the reorganisation it is likely that the recommendations could have been superseded and rendered outmoded.The steering committee recommenced its work in 2012 and met in February 2012 where the changing circumstances were discussed and a way forward was decided.  Unfortunately, the chairperson was unable to continue in her capacity due to personal circumstances and a member of the steering committee is acting as interim chair pending the appointment of a new independent chair.  The steering committee met most recently on 3 May.  I am informed that good progress is being made and that drafting of the report is well under way.   The steering committee is aware that its recommendations must have due regard to the broader reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  On completion of the report the procedure is for the chairperson to forward a copy to myself and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In advance of publication, I will bring forward a memorandum to Government outlining the key findings and actions to be undertaken.  Value for money reviews are subsequently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published on the Department's website.Ideally, this review would be completed by now but circumstances have conspired to extend the period of preparation.  I have asked the interim chair and members of the steering committee and working group to progress the review as quickly as possible and I anticipate its completion by end September
#DenisLandy	unknown-#DenisLandy-party	unknown-#DenisLandy-dob	unknown-#DenisLandy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I thank the Minister for his report.  I declare a particular interest in this area about which I have spoken to the Minister in the Seanad.  As a former member of the Reserve Defence Force for many years it is interesting to note that the last item on the agenda was on the Lebanon.  For many years Army barracks across the country were kept open and personnel were substituted from the Reserve Defence Force because of the numbers of personnel overseas and on Border duty.  Thankfully, Border duty is no longer an issue.I am concerned at some of the items which have featured in the Minister's report on the matter.  In his report, Mr. McCarthy expressed strong views on the abolition of manyareas to save money, many of which have since been analysed and have proven not to be feasible and some have been proven to be unrealistic.  I note that the Reserve Defence Force strength reduction proposed was 2,500 personnel, which is two thirds of its present strength.  I understand the strength of the Reserve Defence Force is 5,200 personnel, not 7,500.  I am aware there is continuing leakage in terms of people who are not re-signing on annually due to low morale.  Some 2,000 personnel have been lost to the Reserve Defence Force since 2009 and recruitment is limited to 400 per annum.  If the trend was to continue, the Reserve Defence Force would not exist as we know it by 2018.  That is the reality.I welcome the fact that the Minister saw fit to provide funding in 2012 for the training of staff in the Reserve Defence Force.  Some people may not be aware of the work of the Reserve.  One of its most important functions for many years is that it provides weekend cover for the Permanent Defence Force, particularly at officer level, across the country.  It is clear the force does not have enough officers to perform the duties required at weekends.  It also provides support in areas, such as my area in south Tipperary, which has experienced flooding problems.  It may not be in the front line but it is covering for the soldiers who are performing external duties outside the Army barracks.In a recent Adjournment debate concerning the provision of premises in Clonmel and Mullingar for the Reserve Defence Force, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, admitted that one of his regrets was that he never joined the Reserve Defence Force as it is a character building career for young men and women where one learns how to polish shoes and so on.I urge caution when dealing with the report.  The abolition of the Reserve Defence Force is not a good move.  It has much good work to do.  I accept there will have to be change.  Changes have already taken place in the Permanent Defence Force and in the number of brigades.  While the members of the Reserve Defence Force are not immune to change, the abolition of the Reserve is not the way forward.Happily, in Ireland we live in peaceful times.  If that position was to change internally - we saw from activities in recent days north of the Border there is always that potential - we need to be able to rely on the Reserve Defence Force to bolster the number of personnel in view of the reduction in the Permanent Defence Force.  I would appreciate the Minister's response to those issues.

However, I have met a number of members - informally because they are not permitted to meet us officially - and I have always been struck by the pride FCA members have in serving.  In the course of the past year, I met a number of them throughout the country and I was struck by the fact that morale has collapsed.  They feel this process has been ongoing for some time and they do not know where they stand.  Therefore, I am glad the Minister has given some indication of a timescale in his remarks.One of the frustrations they have included - following on the publication of the McCarthy report - is that they feel that in making savings of €5.6 million, the budget does not include the costs associated with the Permanent Defence Force, that is the people who manage the RDF, and that the Reserve Defence Force gets lumped with costs that would still be part of the Defence Forces even if there was no RDF.  They say that in any analysis of the organisation, more effort and attention should be given to stripping out the associated costs.  There is also ongoing frustration within the RDF, I imagine this is the same all over the world, between the reserve, the volunteers and the full-time staff.  The same is probably true for political parties.  They feel the Permanent Defence Force wants nothing to do with them and would rather they went away.  They feel their interests are not being represented and that they are not getting a fair share of budgets or of a potential role.As Senator Landy mentioned, in terms of labour activation measures, RDF members pick up a skill set such as discipline, coping skills and skills for dealing with issues like flood prevention.  Some consideration should be given, therefore, to focusing these skills on labour force activation and using them to help people.  I am aware that over the years many people have come through the RDF and picked up skills along the way.  Therefore, this is something we should consider in terms of a jobs activation budget.I welcome the clarification the Minister brought to the broader issue of reorganisation.  Is it the intention to have the process finalised and in place - the brigades and Army reorganised - ahead of the next budget or is it likely to be 2013 before it is in place?  Obviously, if it is delayed until 2013, the envisaged savings from the reorganisation will not accrue to this year's defence budget?  Will there be a need for a Supplementary Estimate to make up for those savings if they do not kick in by the end of 2012?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I will deal with the issues raised by both Senator Landy and Deputy Calleary.  It is unfortunate the review of the RDF has taken so long, but that is not the fault of any of my predecessors nor of officials in the Department.  Rather, it is a consequence of the fiscal difficulties that have hit us and of the multiple reviews that have been undertaken across a broad range of Departments which had to be given priority.  Then when we found ourselves in a position where we were looking at a general reorganisation of the Defence Forces, in the context of moving from three brigades to two, it was important work commenced on that, because issues relating to the RDF could not be addressed in a vacuum separate from the new structure to be put in place.The role of the reserve is important.  However, we must remember that we have, within the Permanent Defence Force, a group of extraordinarily well-trained individuals who, when an issue arises that requires the assistance of the Defence Force domestically, are first called upon.  The Reserve Defence Force is as its name describes, a reserve.  The last occasion the RDF was required to assist the Permanent Defence Force in the role of assisting the civil power was in 2005.  There has not been a recent event in which the RDF was required to engage in any large number.  The number of members of the RDF has reduced, but there were substantial numbers who were nominally part of it but who were not engaged in it nor participating in training days.  It is important now that we look at the future role of the RDF and its place in the context of the restructuring of the Defence Forces.  There is no proposal from the Government to implement the McCarthy proposal at this point in time, nor is there any proposal from it to abolish the RDF.  However, we must look at its role and be conscious of the cost of maintaining it and of its relevance at this time.  In the context of the future of the RDF, it is important that those engaged in it feel they have a relevant role.  All of these issues will be addressed by the review.With regard to the financial issues, there is a substantial cost attached to the RDF.  The 2012 provision for it is €4.386 million, the same sum available in 2011, and some €2.5 million of that goes for paid training days.  There is a substantial additional cost to the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the RDF.  The Permanent Defence Force cadre pays an employer's PRSI and the 2011 outturn was €16.262 million.  The allowances paid to PDF cadre amounted to €2.592 million.  The overall cost or outturn, if one takes the supports provided by the PDF to the RDF, together with the funding provided for the RDF itself, was €23 million in 2011.  The major portion of that is spent on the PDF support network to maintain the RDF.  Therefore, whether issues relating to the RDF are organised to the optimum benefit to ensure efficient use of resources is an issue to which the review will have regard.  It is important these issues are considered and addressed and, hopefully, the review will be complete by the end of September.In the meantime, the move from a three brigade to a two brigade structure is proceeding and engagement is taking place at official level between the Department and the military side, involving the Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and those working immediately below them.  They are looking at how we best restructure to ensure that we have as efficient Defence Forces as is possible, which is organised in a manner that brings the optimum benefit for operational capabilities and which utilises the resources and barracks that are available.  In the context of barracks, we are in a position where, having closed some barracks, we now know the situation.  There are no plans to close any additional barracks and it is not envisaged that the reorganisation will result of any.  The reorganisation is internal and switches from a three brigade to a two brigade structure.  Sometimes as I move around the country, I hear rumours of closures and people are concerned that this process may result in the closure of a major barracks somewhere. That is not going to happen.  That is not part of the process now under way which is to ensure we utilise the numbers to the maximum benefit and that we utilise and recruit the soldiers as are required, that we have the appropriate numbers of Defence Forces officers and that there is not a disproportionate number of officers compared with the number of ordinary members of the Defence Forces.  These are all issues of concern to those working in the Defence Forces.  I am conscious that those who aspire to or look forward to being promoted may be concerned that their career paths may be affected by the re-organisation.  However, one does not have as many officers in a force of 9,500 as in a force of 11,500.  These are very important issues to be dealt with.  I wish to record my thanks to the Secretary General, to the Chief of Staff and to those working with them for their very important work in this area and which will ensure that the Defence Forces are slim, fit for purpose and resource-maximising in the future, to the benefit of the country and in order to maintain continuing operations such as co-operation with the United Nations and with European Union member states in the battle groups in place from time to time and also meeting the necessary domestic obligations.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	46	If I may add some personal comments, I was a member of the Reserve Defence Force - it was called the FCA - for quite a number of years and I resigned my commission when I was elected to the Dáil although it was probably a timely decision on the grounds of age in any case.This morning we observed the Defence Forces participating at the ceremony for the national day of commemoration.  I join with the Minister and other speakers in commending how the Defence Forces carried out their duties in such a professional and responsible manner.  I accompanied the Minister to the Lebanon and I was very proud to see the young soldiers in action there.  They do us proud, as the Minister said.I wish to commend the Naval Service which could be termed the fourth brigade.  It operates on the high seas often beyond the horizon in extremely difficult conditions of weather and otherwise.  When the Minister is re-organising the brigade structure from three brigades to two, it might be no harm to bear in mind that we have another brigade at sea.  Naval Service ships could perhaps be used as accommodation in future operations by the Army where conditions on land may not be suitable for the billeting of soldiers.  I suggest that we could consider having a contingent of marines, soldiers who travel on ships, who could be deployed on peacekeeping missions and be based on ships.The Minister has visited the Naval Service headquarters in Cork and the committee members hope to visit soon.  I refer also to the work of the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Centre, IMERC.Over the years we have noted the commitment of the members of the Reserve Defence Force and their desire to serve their country.  Thankfully, there has not been a call on its service since 2005 but this raises the question of its role.  If an organisation does not have a role it loses morale.  One suggestion would be to integrate companies of the Reserve Defence Force into the regular battalions so that they would become part of an integrated unit.Senator Landy referred to the character and moral development role of the Reserve Defence Force for young people with an interest in things military.  In more difficult times in the past, young men joined the reserve because of their interest in military life.It may be opportune to consider the role of Civil Defence.  If the Reserve Defence Force is to be down-sized, perhaps Civil Defence could provide an opportunity for people to become involved in those activities which are of a similar nature but are not of a military nature.  This committee looks forward to considering the report when it is available.  I join with the Minister in expressing concern at the length of time it has taken to produce this report but it is hoped to see it completed before too long.  I wished to make those comments because I have strong views in this regard.I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance and for working with the committee in this marathon session.  We look forward to other such sessions in the future.
