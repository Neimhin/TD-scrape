Is the Minister concerned about the movement to e-payments by the Department of Social Protection? What plans does the Minister have to guarantee the future of the Irish post office network?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	There is no Government plan to close post offices. The decline in post office numbers has, in fact, been arrested. Figures in the Grant Thornton report commissioned by the Irish Postmasters Union show that, although there were 197 closures between 2006 and 2010, from the end of 2010 to date there have been 17 closures. Reference was made to the business carried out by An Post for the Department of Social Protection. The new six year contract to handle social welfare payments, which was recently won by An Post, is good news for the post office network. Securing the future feasibility of the post office network in the longer term will not be achieved by restricting individual access to e-payment solutions. Rather, the post office network must continue to modernise, as it is doing, to provide the services that its customers require. An Post has undertaken a programme of capital investment especially in the computerisation of the post office network, including the automation of all post offices. As a result, the post office network stands well positioned to become the front-office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector for both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over-the-counter transactions. Naturally, any such developments would have to be subject to public procurement requirements, as appropriate. An Post has made considerable progress towards diversification with its enhanced arrangement with Aviva for the transfer of Aviva Ireland's branch office personal business insurance business book to One Direct.The opportunity to pay local property tax through the post office network has also been secured. It is also important to acknowledge the responsibilities of postmasters themselves to develop new ways of meeting customers’ needs at the post office counter. I look forward to hearing what the Irish Postmasters Union considers its members can achieve at a meeting I am due to hold with the union soon.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 I welcomed the fact that the Government has agreed to my proposal for a whole-of-Government consideration, encompassing central and local government and the wider public service, of the nature and extent of services that can be provided to the public using the post office network as a front office of Government. This whole-of-Government analysis will be undertaken in the first instance by the Cabinet committee on social policy with a view to a report to Government by that committee. This will afford an opportunity for a holistic review of the range of services which could be provided by the post office network and could perhaps yield synergies among the different agencies. The Cabinet committee on social policy is the appropriate vehicle for dealing with the whole-of-Government approach required for the future of the post office network.

The Irish Postmasters Union is very concerned about any threat to post offices, including issues concerning their closure. It is time we examined the post office network, which is a trusted high street brand. Like other public services, including the ESB, there is a public service obligation to maintain the network. We must challenge An Post because for far too long the line has been that the company is a commercial State entity which must conduct its business commercially. If we are serious about maintaining the post office network, both in urban and rural areas, there should be an obligation on An Post to maintain the network. That should be written into the memorandum to An Post, so that it would have to maintain the network like the ESB and other State companies. That would force An Post to find products for its market. Over the years, we have had debates on what services the post office network should provide.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I agree with Deputy Moynihan's disposition towards the importance and value of An Post. However, the Irish postal service is a network of commercial enterprises that are subject to EU competition law, so there is no avoiding that. I do not disagree with the sentiments that Deputy Moynihan has expressed but in his question he asks about my plans to guarantee the future of the Irish post office network. Since coming to office, I have taken a number of measures to arrest the decline and rate of closure. I gave the figures earlier but I cannot give a guarantee because public procurement and EU competition law apply. That basic point must be understood because we are not going to have some deus ex machina entering from stage-left that can wave a magic wand and say that EU law applies, but not to the Irish post office network. The Cabinet sub-committee on social policy is examining what can be done on a whole-of-Government basis but that, too, must be responded to by the Irish postmasters themselves in terms of innovative ideas. These include creating new products and services that, consistent with EU law, will enable the post office network to be used as a front-of-office facility for the provision of Government services.

The ESB is a case in point - it is a commercial semi-State company but is obliged to maintain networks in every community. Is it not time to be realistic? It is 23 or 24 years since the "Save our post offices" campaign began, yet the post office network has been steadily eroded. When a post office closes, the community closes also. Is there a possibility that under EU and domestic law we can push An Post to maintain the network which will then become the Government office in a community? It is high time we dramatically challenged what is there at the moment, otherwise I fear for the future of many post offices.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	The universal service obligation stands. It is Government policy and we have reflected that Government policy at EU level, which is that the universal service obligation should apply and continue to apply. It is no longer possible, as a member state of the European Union, that any Minister or anyone from any side of the House can prescribe that in future the post office in whatever town or village has the exclusive right to be the front office for government services, irrespective. It was necessary to go through a public tender process to hold on to the social welfare contract. Happily, this happened last year. However, these services have to comply with EU procurement law but this compliance allows for many things to be done. I do not know of any other organisation that has almost 1,150 retail outlets scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country. I will welcome any input I receive not only from Deputy Moynihan and his party but from any other colleagues in the House. I will bring any such proposals which are innovative and feasible to the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with this matter.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I wish to take a couple of seconds to vent my frustration. Because of the rules, protocols and regulations in this place, I was not able to change my priority questions after 11 a.m. on Thursday. The Minister announced in the press a major change with regard to a renewable energy project which has been effectively mothballed. Neither Deputy Moynihan nor I could change our questions and it makes no sense. I hope we will have an opportunity during this week to hear the Minister make a statement and to ask questions on it. A postcode system entails converting map coordinates into machine-readable format and it is not a complicated process. Yet, it is reported that this cost €25.6 million for a contract over ten years and in addition there will be a tender for a contract for technical advice and support. This is extraordinary because I would have thought this cost would have been included in €25.6 million. It is reported that it will cost an additional €5 million to integrate the postcode system with other government software systems. There was also a €40 million turnover requirement for companies tendering for the contract which excluded most, if not all, Irish IT small and medium enterprises from applying. How is this reconciled with the Government's stated aim to support SMEs?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	My Department commenced the procurement process for a national postcode system in 2011. An open and competitive procurement process was conducted in accordance with Department of Finance and EU procurement frameworks. A pre- qualification questionnaire was issued on www.etenders.gov.ie
on 17 January 2011. This invited interested parties to tender for the contract as a postcode management licence-holder for a period of ten years, to design, provide, disseminate and maintain a national postcode system. This procurement process followed the negotiated procedure under the relevant EU regulations. I must inform the Deputy that the process is a great deal more complex than he has presented. Given the technical complexity of the project, the Department ran the procurement following a competitive dialogue procedure provided for in the public supply and works Directive. The procurement was managed by my Department assisted by its advisors, PA Consulting. The procurement comprised three specific stages. Stage 1 was a pre-qualification process involving the short-listing of candidates for the next stage on their technical capacity and financial and economic standing and this took place in early 2011. Stage 2 was an invitation to submit initial proposals together with a competitive dialogue and this took place in 2011. Stage 3 was the final tender and took place in June 2013. Three parties qualified following stage 1 of the procurement process.Landmark, a UK company, withdrew from the process at the final tender stage. The Department subsequently received two final bids from consortia led by Capita and An Post, respectively. The two bids were evaluated by an evaluation team comprising senior personnel from my Department and its advisers. That evaluation process was conducted in August 2013 and the bids were analysed and evaluated under a number of award criteria. The evaluation team concluded that Capita's proposal best met the criteria set out in the tender documentation and recommended it as the preferred bidder. I brought that recommendation to Government for approval in October 2013 and signed the contract with Capita on 20 December last year.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	There is nobody better than management consultants at making a simple matter complex. The more complex it becomes, the more they and their friends can cash in. A postcode system converts map coordinates into machine-readable format. The complexity in this case apparently arose because the system had to be tailored in a certain way to support the administration and organisation of public services. That has never been fully explained. In addition, I still do not understand why there was a requirement for tendering companies to have a turnover of €40 million or more, a requirement which excluded most Irish IT companies from the competition. It was also reported that a person, persons or company involved in analysis, design and advice in regard to the system was also part of the consortium which eventually won the tender. Will the Minister comment on that?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	We have a leading-edge project here. In a context where every OECD country has already introduced this type of system - most of them 30 years ago - we are able to benefit from the subsequent advances in technology. Moreover, the expenditure on the project will go back to the State on a scale in excess of 50% because it involves preparing the databases within Departments and so on. The company that won the competition already employs 1,000 people in Ireland. I did not know there was a turnover threshold below which companies could not apply, and I am sceptical as to whether that was, in fact, the case. In any event, as we can see from the period of time it has taken to reach where we are, a great deal of care went into ensuring the company chosen has the proven capacity to deliver on this significant challenge. The establishment of a system of unique identifiers puts us at the leading edge in terms of this type of technology. The new system has been universally welcomed - particularly by business, and not just businesses in the logistics areas. In the context of an era of digital enterprise, this is the way we have to go. In addition, it will add to the bottom line of An Post.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	I have it on the good authority that the €40 million turnover threshold was indeed a requirement for tendering companies. Perhaps the Minister will look into the matter and draw up a note as to how that figure was arrived at. The Minister referred to complexity. In fact, all we have had is a statement to the effect that the complexity arises because the system will be used by Departments and will support the planning and evaluation of services. However, that aspect was never outlined so that the likes of me can understand where the complexity actually lies. The Minister made no reference to the fact that a person, persons or company involved in analysis, design and advice in regard to the system is now benefiting from the ten-year contract that was awarded.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I do not know what the Deputy means by his last point. I will, of course, furnish him with a note on the point he makes about the threshold, but I do not know to whom he is referring in his last point.I do not know who he considers to be "benefiting". The officials in my Department who brought forward the project are not benefiting. The company that was eventually selected has an extensive involvement in Ireland and a proven track record elsewhere. The value of the system is that it will improve the efficiency and accuracy of internal business processes and deliver improved efficiencies with regard to logistics. Deputy Colreavy has previously raised with me issues regarding the emergency services, each of which has welcomed this development. The system will facilitate better planning and analysis capabilities across the public and private sectors. It will provide a stimulus to mail volumes through improved direct marketing capabilities. It will enable organisations to improve existing services or develop new service offerings. It will facilitate improved efficiencies and quality improvement in the mail sector.

Steps need to be taken now to ensure Irish companies can avail of these opportunities when these projects are commenced.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	The offshore renewable energy development plan, which I published last month, identifies an opportunity for Ireland to realise the potential of our offshore energy resources by increasing indigenous production of renewable energy, thereby contributing to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, improving the security of our energy supply and creating jobs in the green economy, especially in coastal communities where there are particular job creation challenges. The strategic environmental assessment that was carried out for the offshore renewable energy development plan found that it would be environmentally sustainable for 4,500 MW of offshore wind to be developed in Irish waters in the period to 2030. The development plan will provide the mechanism through which action across Government Departments and agencies to support the development of offshore renewable electricity generation can be fully co-ordinated in areas such as environmental monitoring, research and development, consenting procedures, infrastructure requirements and enterprise development. There will be potential for local job creation in construction, maintenance and the supply of materials and equipment, including offshore surveying, transportation and installation vessels and associated manpower. There will also be opportunities to develop new products across information technology, remote communications and software. All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, will have to co-ordinate their activities to ensure the employment potential of offshore projects is maximised. This opportunity has already been identified by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies. My Department and I will work with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to put in place an appropriately led and resourced programme to ensure domestic companies avail of local opportunities for a period and are well placed to explore opportunities to internationalise their operations. As highlighted in the offshore renewable energy development plan, the potential for the offshore wind energy sector to contribute to EU energy needs beyond 2020 and provide jobs has been recognised, notably in the European Commission’s blue growth study. Economic analysis carried out for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland indicates that a level of three construction job years per MW of offshore wind deployed, along with 0.6 jobs per MW in ongoing operations and maintenance of offshore installations, can be achieved.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I thank the Minister for his response, the concluding part of which outlined the significant job potential that exists in this area. We need to gear up to be able to avail of those opportunities. I am thinking particularly of the supply of vessels during the construction phase. There is huge potential in the case of one of the projects proposed at the moment because it is estimated that up to 40 vessels will be required.I know of a number of boatyards that would be in a position to construct those vessels if they were geared up for it and encouraged to go for that level of business, which is very significant. In terms of providing crew, we have many highly trained and skilled former and current fishermen working in the UK and Germany on these projects who would need minor upskilling to allow them to develop further and avail of these opportunities. Will the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources be co-ordinating this to ensure it happens or is this something that will sit in the ether and wait for somebody to pick it up and run with it?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	If the Deputy gets an opportunity to study the OREDP, which I published last month, he will see there are many actions at my door that will have to be driven in the years ahead. Ocean energy encompasses much more than purely the offshore wind aspect. Wave and tidal sources of energy are still at the research stage, but we have uniquely propitious resources in that area. I am also interested to do anything we can to improve the rate of offshore exploration and appraisal activity. An area such as Killybegs would be well suited to accommodate that. I understand it has a deep port and, as the Deputy has said, it has local labour with skills in the broad area. One of the attractions of the OREDP is that it holds considerable prospects for coastal communities that would not otherwise have the prospect of employment.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I thank the Minister. Will the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources drive the delivery of the opportunities or who will be responsible for delivering the outcomes? Having somebody driving it is key to the creation of indigenous jobs.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	We discussed that at Cabinet when I brought the memorandum on the OREDP. The Deputy's question is pertinent because the situation has always been somewhat disparate, to put it mildly. My Department has the role we know about. In addition, the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation all have roles. In Cabinet there was emphasis for the Ministers concerned to come together to see what progress we might make. I am certainly determined that should be the case. I am and have been in discussion with my colleagues about the future in this area.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	There has been detailed engagement by my Department with the European Commission over recent years on the transposition and implementation of the EU third energy package. The Commission notice of referral refers to Ireland having adopted a considerable amount of legislation required by the directive but notes that some provisions remain to be transposed. My Department is at an advanced stage in the drafting of a limited number of additional legislative provisions. These will provide for the full transposition of most of the outstanding provisions of the electricity directive, some of which are included in the matters which the Commission has decided to refer to the European Court of Justice, with the exception of a provision on unbundling, which is also included in the matters referred by the Commission. I am committed to having these remaining technical provisions fully transposed as early as possible this year, well in advance of any hearing in the European Court of Justice.In relation to transposition of the rules on ownership unbundling, Ireland opted for, and subsequently received, certification from the European Commission for the operation of the electricity transmission system under Article 9(9) of the directive and so did not apply full ownership unbundling as provided for in Article 9(9). Certification under the Article 9(9) option is obtained provided the European Commission is satisfied with regard to multiple matters concerning the ownership and operation of the transmission system. I am awaiting receipt of the specific detail of the European Commission's case in the notice of application to the European Court and I will consider my response once legal examination of these issues is completed. The application of the Commission to the court has not yet been received. In view of the complexity of the directive, the extensive number of provisions to be transposed and the detailed correspondence engaged in to date, it appears prudent and appropriate to me to await such a legal examination of the precise statement of the outstanding issues, and of the case itself, before deciding on the next steps.

Also, what are the limited number of additional legislative provisions to which the Minister referred in his reply? I understand these were to be enacted on 3 March 2011.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I can give the Deputy an example. In the context of cross-border issues, the national energy regulator, which in Ireland's case is the Commission for Energy Regulation, is required to maintain the same level of confidentiality regarding any information received from another regulatory authority as that which applies to the original regulatory authority. The regulator is to be required to comply with directive provisions regarding cross-border arrangements such as informing the European Commission about relevant decisions taken by another regulator allowing it to request the EU energy regulatory body, known as ACER, for an opinion on cross-border trade. Energy supply undertakings, for example, Electric Ireland, SSE Airtricity and BG Energy, is to be required to keep records for five years and to make them available to the European Commission, the regulator or the Competition Authority as may be requested. The transmission system operator, which in Ireland's case is Eirgrid, is to be required to make public information necessary for the effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market. There is a number of others in similar mode. They are not exactly bedtime reading but I can assure Deputy Moynihan they are in hand and that additional legislative proposals will be ready before the date of the court case.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	As I understand it the ultimate aim of the directive is to ensure that there is more competition in the market. In view of that I ask the Minister to make sure that any outstanding issues are complied with as soon as possible because we hear on a daily basis, and I note the Bord Gáis increase announced this week, that there must be more competition in the market. It is difficult to justify some of the increases that have been granted.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	We have a healthy marketplace now. In addition to the companies I named, we now have Centrica, a major company in the neighbouring island, coming in after the purchase of Bord Gáis Energy. Most commentators would agree that we have significant competition in the marketplace but I agree with Deputy Moynihan that one has to be vigilant about this. There were particular reasons the previous Government held the view it did on the question of breaking up the ESB, and there were particular reasons for the decisions I made at the time, and I do not believe there will be disagreement between Deputy Moynihan and myself about them.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	EirGrid’s Grid25 plan to upgrade the national transmission system between now and 2025 is a major initiative which will put in place a safe, secure and affordable electricity system throughout the country. On 28 January last, in response to EirGrid’s recent public consultation process, I announced that I had appointed an independent panel of experts, chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, to decide the terms of reference for, and to oversee the integrity of, a process to be undertaken by EirGrid to report on comprehensive, route-specific studies of overhead and underground options for both the Grid Link and Grid West projects under the Grid25 programme. The outputs from those studies, which will be required to be complete, objective and comparable, will be published before proceeding to the next stage of public consultation on the two projects. The two studies will take account of environmental factors, including visual amenity impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The panel will have power to commission its own work if there is any perceived deficiency in the studies as presented. The panel has commenced its deliberations, including settling the terms of reference to oversee the integrity of the process being put in place and considering what work, if any, it might usefully undertake in regard to the North-South transmission line project. The panel’s terms of reference will be published by the panel once they have been agreed. Similarly, the panel's position regarding submissions of material to it, and third party requests to meet it, will also be published once the panel has finalised and agreed its position on these matters. I should mention that the report to which the Deputy refers was reviewed by the international expert commission for the Meath-Tyrone project in 2011 as part of its work reviewing all relevant reports. The commission questioned the findings and the methodology of the Askon report and reported its observations at some length in its report, which was published on 17 January 2012.

Askon found that underground cables were better suited to integrating our network. It found that underground was more reliable, that transmission loss was significantly less than when using overground and that underground cables were safer. It found there were obvious environmental benefits and it also found that it could be done at an affordable cost compared with the figures put forward by proponents of overground. When adding to that the damage that will inevitably be done to tourism by overhead cables and the associated pylons, and the damage to property values, it would seem negligent if we were not to look again at the Askon report. While I do not know whether either statement of views is right, I believe we need to look afresh at Askon's report.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	As Deputy Colreavy fairly said, there are a wide range of views on this. For a short piece of interconnector line, it must be the most examined and studied line in the history of transmission. If the expert panel under former Supreme Court Justice Catherine McGuinness agrees to look at it, the panel will, as a result, review the reports that are there, and that includes the Askon report. I presume it is a slip of the tongue by Deputy Colreavy when he asks me to put the pylons underground. Up to now, the demand on me has been to put the cables underground, and I am having great difficulty and pain in responding to that. However, the proposition that I have to put the pylons underground would, Deputy Colreavy might agree, be prohibitively expensive.

I know his Department has been studying wind energy extensively. One of the great problems anywhere wind energy is produced is the fact that we cannot control when the wind blows or the rate at which it blows. Has the Minister looked into the specific problems regarding those changes in frequency through the connection of a large amount of variable wind power to the national grid? What are the technical and other challenges that variations in frequency and the difficulty in predicting frequency pose in terms of connecting to the national grid?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 34 together. Electricity demand must be met by generating the exact amount of energy required at any point in time. The responsibility for maintaining this balance between demand and supply is managed in real time by EirGrid, the independent electricity transmission system operator. To deliver on this remit, EirGrid's operation of the electricity system includes the day-to-day planning of availability of generation plant, both conventional and renewable, to ensure power flows on the electricity grid are managed reliably and securely. On an ongoing basis, EirGrid also plans and develops our electricity transmission infrastructure to enable the integration of sufficient renewable energy generation to allow 40% of electricity demand to be met by renewable energy by 2020, a key element required to meet Ireland's EU target of 16% of our total energy demand being met from renewable sources by 2020. The balance between supply and demand and the stability of the electricity grid are managed by EirGrid at its national control centre in Dublin. System frequency is an indicator of success in managing the supply-demand balance. On numerous occasions in recent years, the amount of variable wind power on the system has been over 50% and system frequency has been successfully managed. A number of major studies have been carried out by EirGrid Group in recent years to investigate the levels of renewable generation that can be securely accommodated on the power system of Ireland and Northern Ireland. These studies have considered the implications for both transmission infrastructure and grid operation of managing a power system with large amounts of variable renewable generation sources. On foot of this work, EirGrid has developed a range of secure operational tools and system management policies to manage the power system with increasing amounts of variable renewable generation. These operational tools and polices are subject to ongoing review and development to ensure security of supply is always maintained. EirGrid's work in this area, in which it co-operates closely with SONI, the system operator for Northern Ireland, began with the carrying out of the all island grid study in 2008. This was followed by the facilitation of renewables study in 2010. These studies provided the basis for EirGrid's programme, "Delivering a Secure Sustainable Electricity System", also known as DS3. A number of work streams are underway in the DS3 programme, including on frequency control. With regard to the specific issues raised by Deputy Colreavy around frequency control, he may wish to consult the report produced as part of the DS3 project Summary of Studies on Rate of Change of Frequency events on the All-Island System published in 2012 which is available on the EirGrid website.

Again, it is not light bedtime reading.Was one of the drivers of the export energy project the fact that, given the uncontrollable changes in frequency in the Irish network, an excess could be exported to Britain? I am puzzled. If the wind blows in Ireland, it is also blowing in Scotland, Wales and the west coast of England. If we have uncontrollable changes in frequency leading to large amounts of energy in our national grid, surely the same would apply in Britain. If both jurisdictions have the same level of supply, or if there is none because the wind is not blowing, I cannot figure out how this project would work.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	The answer to the substantive question is "No". The contemplated export project has nothing to do with excess capacity in the system. As that project has been planned, the requirement on the Government is to put in place the intergovernmental agreement that facilitates trade in green energy under the relevant EU directive. It is a private sector project and is entirely separate from the refurbishment of the transmission system. It is also a different technology, a DC subsea cable. I am not competent to enter into a technical discussion with Deputy Colreavy on whether it is true that, when the wind blows in Ireland, it also blows in Scotland and England, but I am not entirely sure-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I thank the Minister.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	Do not cut me off in mid-flow. This could be a major scientific breakthrough. Deputy Colreavy knows that the wind can blow strongly in the west, yet it need not be blowing strongly here on the east coast. Similarly, there could be high winds in Scotland without there necessarily being wind in Ireland.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	I will revert to the Minister and will not cut him off.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	We may well be able to set up a task force to get to the bottom of this matter.

The point about AC-DC lines being bandied about is in respect of changes, interconnectors, etc. When I sought advice on this matter from technical people, many claimed that going from one to the other was not as major an issue as had been suggested. I am unsure as to whether the experts have advised the Department on the technicalities.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	Is Deputy Colreavy satisfied?
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	Yes.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	Deputy Moynihan is correct. It is technically feasible, but the cost that comes with it is the issue. For example, one could run an AC cable and, upon reaching a particularly scenic area, nothing would prevent one from putting the cable underground, but it could not be for a long distance. Doing that would require a DC cable. Take something as simple as the Tyrone-Meath line. The international expert commission concluded that putting it underground would have approximately 3.1 times the cost of traditional AC overhead transmission. Deputy Colreavy referred to some of the other reports that have been done. They suggest that the cost would be even more. It is around that figure. This is a major factor, but it is not the only one. After a year of study in Denmark, for example, and despite having no difficulty with affording such an approach and so on, it decided not to go underground with 440 kV cables for a combination of reasons, not just cost, but also technical considerations in term of how easy it was to find a fault, etc.It is complex terrain.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	My question is on the governance of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and arises on foot of the issue which arose with the payout by RTE to a member of the authority who took legal action. I want to find out about the changes proposed by the Minister to the Broadcasting Act 2009, which he has indicated he intends to bring forward.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	At the outset, I clarify that my responsibility is for broadcasting legislation. Defamation legislation is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality. The commitment I gave during the debate in the Seanad on 18 February 2014 was to amend section 39 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. That section requires every broadcaster to ensure that nothing is broadcast which might reasonably be regarded as causing offence. This seems an unfeasibly rigorous approach. Some people may be easily offended even where offence was not intended and is not objectively ascertainable. The amendment I am considering would require broadcasters to avoid causing undue offence, which represents a more objective test in tune with the realities of modern public debate. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland was established by the Broadcasting Act 2009 to regulate content across all Irish broadcasting services. Section 24 of the Act provides that the BAI shall be independent in the performance of its functions. Section 23 obliges the authority to draw up and adopt a code of conduct in respect of controls on interests and ethical behaviour to apply to each member of the authority, statutory committees, advisory committees and members of staff. In common with all public service bodies and in accordance with paragraph 31.1(iv) of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland affirms on an annual basis that its code of business conduct is in place and has been adhered to. A copy of the authority's code of business conduct is available on that body's website. Furthermore, authority and committee members, as well as staff, are subject to sections 21 and 22 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides for the disclosure of any conflicts of interest. Section 20 of the 2009 Act places duties of accountability to Oireachtas committees on the chief executive and chairperson of the authority and on the chairpersons of the statutory compliance and contract awards committees. These obligations and controls are sufficient and, as such, I see no need to for further legislative proposals in this area.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	If someone was a member of the complaints committee overseeing broadcasting and launched a legal action, lessons would fall to be learned in the context of the code of conduct. I am trying to find out if there is oversight in the Department where there is a conflict of interest. Where is the conflict disclosed? A major conflict of interest arose recently when €85,000 was paid out by RTE. When the case was launched, the person taking the action was a member of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's complaints committee. Are there lessons to be learned in respect of the code of conduct and how is that conflict overseen? At what point is there a sanction? What sanction can be applied? It seems like a glaring conflict of interest.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	Whatever changes I eventually settle on, I will put them into committee where we can tease through the type of issue Deputy Murphy raises. I do not know of any legal prohibition to provide for the circumstances the Deputy describes. One could easily see the case for the defence in this matter, namely, that the person being referred to took offence and sought an apology. As I understand it, as soon as litigation was contemplated, the individual in question resigned his position. In fairness, it is important to say this. Whether there should be a legal obligation to provide for circumstances of this nature is a matter on which I have an open mind. To the best of my knowledge, there is no such legal obligation and the normal code of conduct as it relates to conflict of interest would apply. 
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I acknowledge that since I tabled the question, the Minister responded to me directly on some of the issues I raised. His letter of reply acknowledged that the case was launched while the individual in question was a member of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. It was at this point that a conflict of interest arose. Conflicts of interest arise all the time. The reason for having a code of conduct is to set out how such conflicts of interest should be addressed. Lessons should be learned from this case because it involved a glaring conflict of interest. Is the Minister certain that the timeline he provided is correct as it is in conflict with the timeline he provided to me in his written response? I understand the case was launched while the individual question was still a member of the complaints committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I have not been furnished with the precise date of the initiation of the contemplated legal action. While that is a matter between the person concerned and his solicitors, my understanding is that there was the narrowest possible window between the legal action being launched and the resignation of the individual in question. In fairness to him, he wrote his letter of resignation as soon as he decided to take the legal route. As I stated, during the refurbishment of the Act I am open to Deputy Murphy and any other Deputy expressing a view on this particular point. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has not been in place for long. It has met one or two squalls in its short period in existence and has, by and large, handled them well. It has certainly made some very thoughtful interventions in the area of public service broadcasting. There is no reason we should not discuss this issue. People always take offence, sometimes on behalf of others. What would it do to television if taking offence was to be the only test?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I have a considerable weight on my shoulders as I must carry the can for my two colleagues, Deputies Pringle and Durkan, who tabled the other questions in this group. As the Minister indicated in reply to a previous question, An Post's greatest asset is its local post office network. The difficulty is that the company views its local network as a cost rather than an asset. The Government is not giving serious consideration to how this asset could be sweated to bring services to communities as opposed to centralising them. I ask the Minister to comment. As I have already heard the Minister's previous comments, there is probably no point in him reading them into the record again.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I am not sure I agree with Deputy Naughten that-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	There are four questions being taken together.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	Did I not read the formal reply?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	I am inviting the Minister to do so now.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	As Deputy Naughten does not wish me to read it, I will not do so. I am not sure I would agree with Deputy Naughten that An Post sees it as a cost rather than an asset. The collapse of mail volumes by 25% in the past five years owing to e-substitution and so on rather than the collapse of An Post's core business is what is driving the pressure on the postal network. The fear on the part of the postmasters is not so much that An Post might lose the social welfare contract, which I take with a grain of salt, but electronic funds transfers because the margin per item transacted would be of considerably less value to it than the traditional over-the-counter cash transaction. That is what concerns them.  I agree with Deputy Naughten that the postal network is an asset. As I said earlier, I am not aware of any business that has 1,149 retail outlets throughout the country. The Cabinet sub-committee is currently looking at whether there are other ways the network can be utilised as a contact point by the public in the context of different Government services. That is the issue. Unfortunately, it must be addressed within procurement and competition law. It may be the case that if we were in France we would not be so scrupulous about observing EU rules in this regard. However, we are not and those rules apply. Deputy Moynihan raised a question with me earlier in regard to EU infringement. I do not know whether it is always the case that the EU pursues big business in the same manner as it pursues small business but that is the law and the impediment in the way.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I thank the Minister for his response. Would he agree that An Post's approach is blinkered, for example, its approach to parcel post, an area that is currently growing because of Internet shopping? An Post has wound down its parcel service and a private operator is currently developing the parcel motel system across the country. Surely, it would have made far more sense for An Post to use its own local network to provide that service, thereby facilitating people shopping via the Internet in the UK and US. However, that did not happen. During a discussion with the Minister on this issue on 4 December last, I outlined to him a number of areas where I felt there was potential to develop the sector, including the use by the HSE of local offices in the context of applications for medical cards and by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the context of single farm payments. The Minister committed on that occasion to considering the feasibility of progressing those possibilities. Perhaps he would update the House of any progress in that regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I did. It is part of the submission being made by my Department to the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy. I have gone outside the two examples provided at that time by Deputy Naughten. I am also looking at the possibility of returning the driving licence service to An Post. I also wonder whether if in small villages where Garda stations have been closed post offices might serve as a clinic for a garda for four hours a day, two days a week or something like that.I have asked my Cabinet colleagues to examine whether there are services relevant to their remits which, consistent with the law, can be provided. That is the purpose of the Cabinet sub-committee taking a whole-of-Government approach to the issue. I hope we will receive the co-operation of An Post and the IPU in respect of that matter.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I welcome the Minister's reply. My next question relates specifically to driving licences. Does the Minister not agree that a huge mistake was made in the context of the approach that was taken in respect of driving licences? Whereas people could previously apply to renew their licences via their local post offices, there are now only a handful of specific locations throughout the country at which it is possible to renew licences. As a result, it is taking ten to 16 weeks to process applications. Postmasters possess a unique skill set. Not only could this skill set be used to revitalise the post office network, it could also be used for the more import task of streamlining government. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is involved in a process of considering the centralisation of services and delivering them by electronic means. Does the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, agree there is a cohort of people who do not have access to decent broadband services or who do not possess the technological skills necessary to use such services? The post office network can facilitate this cohort by providing that vital link to its members. While there may not be a specific saving to be made in respect of the small cohort whose members continue to use the paper-based system via their local post offices, there is a significant reduction in the supports required in respect of any national scheme - such as that, for example, which relates to the local property tax - if the system to which I refer is utilised. If the status quo continued to obtain in this regard, it would still be possible for the automated backroom service to continue to be provided on a national basis. Savings could still be delivered nationally while the service would continue to be delivered locally.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	There are very good social reasons why we cannot consider this matter only through the prism of cost. I accept the argument in that regard. Like all clichés, however, that which Deputy Moynihan condemned earlier has a grain of truth. As Deputy Moynihan stated, An Post is a commercial State company with a remit to carry out its business profitably, etc. As such, it is not in receipt of an Exchequer subvention. Obviously, the company and its directors must have regard to that. My memory of the driving licence issue is that the tender was won on the basis of 40 outlets being provided, whereas An Post had offered some 200 plus outlets. The experience anecdotally is that the new system is proving inconvenient for people in many parts of the country, including Dublin. It is a bit of an undertaking for people to travel to a single location to renew their driving licences and then return to work or wherever. This is a good example and I am in discussions in respect of it with my colleagues. I received enormous support a couple of weeks ago on Private Members' business. In fact, I have never had such a gale of support behind me right across the House. I hope that will last.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	Is it not the kernel of the issue that An Post has a major asset in terms of the number of retail outlets it owns? Any company operating in an urban or a rural setting whose business is in decline as a result of the impact of electronic transactions and so forth will seek replacement business. There is a huge volume of such business available. The board and management of An Post does not seem to be empowered to go after the type of business that would make the company's retail network sustainable.Until there is an obligation on the board under a memorandum of understanding or a policy direction from everyone to the effect that An Post should go after these businesses, nothing will improve. Every Deputy in the House has ideas on what business An Post should be going after. The board of An Post does not seem to be making any effort to ensure the feasibility of these post offices now or in future.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	Reference was made to Private Members' business and most of the Minister's response merits our support because he restated the Government's intention in the programme for Government to sustain the post office network. The Minister also stated the Government has no intention of closing post offices. However, it was what the Minister said further on in his response that concerns me. There seems to be a fatal acceptance by the Government that all the trade will move from the town and village high street to shopping centres in major county and provincial centres of population. That could be a self-fulfilling prophecy unless the Government steps in, and if we do not have a strategy that is what will happen. If that is what happens, then whether the Government wishes it, not only will post offices close but every business, including all the shops, will close in the high streets of towns and villages. I call on the Minister to look again at the response he gave to that point. There is more to the country than major shopping centres in major centres of population and we should nurture what is precious in the smaller towns and villages as well as looking after the cities.

Will the Minister set out the extent to which he has continued to encourage likely suitable or applicable services to be attached to An Post that could broaden and spread its services throughout the country, increase the feasibility and longevity of the network and contribute largely to an interaction with urban and rural communities, which is needed as we progress? In recent years greater efforts have been made by the Minister to ensure the retention of the services of An Post. One possible service which could be added on - it is a necessary service - is the collation of the voting register, which is in need of urgent review in most constituencies and counties. It is eminently suitable as a bolt-on service to An Post.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	There is time for two more brief questions from Deputies Naughten and Troy.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	As the Minister is aware, the banks do not want customers, especially those dealing in cash or cheques, coming into branches, and this causes major problems for older people in particular. Will the Minister ensure that when the NTMA contract is being renewed, this issue is addressed? In many cases older people use the Government savings schemes and they like the system that is in place through the community network provided by An Post.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	Will the Minister outline the position on the payment of social welfare in the post office network? As I highlighted last week during the Private Members' debate, the Department of Social Protection is actively encouraging people to move their payments from the post office to bank accounts. Last week, we learned that the payment for rent allowance will now be taken directly at source from social welfare payments, thereby removing another service rather than encouraging and pushing services to the post office system. Last week we learned that a Department is taking a further service away from the post office, that is, the payment of the rent allowance, which will be taken directly at source.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	It is not the case that An Post has sat on its hands, so to speak, in this area. An Post has extended new business lines in recent years in a range of areas, including Garda fines, gun licences, insurance services, foreign exchange services, Postfone, extended banking services, TaxPay, the DHL retail partnership, real-time waste top-up, Dublin same-day delivery, Saorview and the secure meter pilot scheme. Many new bill payment customers have been added and there has been a significant growth in the gift voucher business and so on. It is not true to say, therefore, that An Post has not come up with new business. What concerns me a little is the proposition that it is the responsibility only of An Post, the Minister or the Government. At issue is a network of commercial enterprises that are privately owned. Of the 1,147 retail outlets, only 57 are owned by An Post. The remainder are privately owned and these too have a responsibility. I will be very positive about any new ideas they come up with provided that does not involve nailing a sign stating "Post office to close" on the door, which is what some of them are doing and which is not exactly the most business-oriented way forward.

I agree with Deputy Durkan. At a time when the banks are resiling from interaction with average customers at the bank counter, there are possibilities for the post office given its network of retail outlets. An Post is and has been examining these possibilities, and some of the arrangements An Post has come up with, including with the likes of Allied Irish Banks, have been rather positive. I assure the concerned postmasters of Ireland that the post office is in safe hands.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	The Tánaiste knows, and we all know, that the Rehab organisation has been asked by the Committee of Public Accounts to appear before it and has been before the committee to answer important questions relating to salaries, pensions and a range of other issues pertaining to the organisation. For good reason we all agree that this is in the public interest, just as it is for other organisations in the charitable area which have significant and substantial service contracts with the State. The figure in question is approximately €80 million worth of funding from the taxpayer to Rehab. It is clearly in the public interest that those who are asked to go before the Committee of Public Accounts should do so. However, there has been an unacceptable degree of prevarication and delay by the Rehab organisation in its dealings with the Committee of Public Accounts. In particular, people were surprised and rather taken aback by the refusal of a former chief executive officer, Frank Flannery, to appear before the committee. He was a strategic adviser to the Taoiseach and his right-hand man on many fronts. He knows the importance of the Oireachtas and of committees like the Committee of Public Accounts. However, he has not gone forward to answer questions that remain unanswered. What was really unacceptable was that on the very day the Committee of Public Accounts was meeting Rehab, Mr. Flannery was in Leinster House on other business, metaphorically giving the two fingers to the Committee of Public Accounts which I believe to be unacceptable.Does the Tánaiste agree that is unacceptable? According to reports in The Irish Times, Rehab was paying its directors specifically to lobby Fine Gael and Labour Party Ministers. It is reported that Mr. Flannery was also paid to do so. Does the Tánaiste accept the principle that it is wholly wrong for charitable organisations, which have such substantial service contracts with the State, to pay their directors to lobby Ministers and arrange meetings with officials in Departments? Does he agree that is fundamentally an unethical principle to adopt? The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, appointed Mr. Flannery as chairman of the Forum on Philanthropy. That organisation has been lobbying, for example, for changes to tax rules on residency governing tax exiles. Does the Tánaiste consider it appropriate that Mr. Flannery should continue in that position while still refusing to go before the Committee of Public Accounts, a cherished institution of the Oireachtas?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I was asked that question here on Thursday last when I stated clearly that I believe Mr. Flannery should attend before the Committee of Public Accounts. I have seen the letter the clerk to the committee wrote to the chief executive of the Rehab group. The letter was issued yesterday and names a number of people, including Mr. Flannery, whom the committee wishes to interview. I believe that all those whom the committee wishes to interview should appear before it. Lobbying is part of our democratic system and people have a right to lobby. However, we need to have transparency around lobbying. The Government has been preparing legislation to provide for a regime whereby there will be a register of lobbyists. Under the proposed legislation, professional lobbyists engaged in formal lobbying will be required to register. There will also be a requirement to record the lobbying that takes place. In other words, the public will know who is lobbying whom and for what. That legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation. The general scheme of the Bill was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and its report has now been received. The drafting of the Bill is proceeding and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, plans to present the Bill to the Houses of the Oireachtas early in the second quarter of this year. When that Bill is enacted we will have a register of lobbyists and a transparent lobbying regime. As regards Mr. Flannery's position as chairman of the Forum on Philanthropy, it is my understanding that he is stepping down from that position.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I thank the Tánaiste for his view that Mr. Flannery should go before the Committee of Public Accounts. I agree with him on that. I am somewhat curious that he did not respond to my question concerning the appropriateness or correctness of charitable organisations, Rehab in particular, that provide services for people with intellectual and physical disabilities, and which have large service contracts with the State for the provision of such services, paying their directors to organise meetings with Ministers and Government officials on behalf of such organisations. It is wrong. They should not be paying their directors money and no one should do so in that situation. We are not talking about private companies or anybody else. We are talking about people who have daily meetings with the State about the services they provide. It is extraordinary that someone with the unrivalled access to power that Mr. Flannery had - and probably still has - should be paid. It has not been denied and there has been no clarification or rebuttal of that report in The Irish Times. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, said he would regularly be met on the Tuesday mornings of Cabinet meetings. Apart altogether from the Bill to establish a register of lobbyists, it should be clearly stated that organisations like that, which deal with the Government regularly - be they the Brothers of Charity, Enable Ireland or Rehab - should not be paying people to meet Government Ministers. Our system is accessible and I am not casting aspersions on Ministers about meeting Rehab or organisations like that. The State pays out €80 million for the services provided by Rehab, so the meetings are quite regular in terms of those service contracts. Does the Tánaiste accept there is no basis, foundation or rationale for any organisation to pay large fees to its own directors with a view to organising meetings with Ministers or officials?

It would seem to me that the appropriate place for that issue to be pursued is at the Committee of Public Accounts. I encourage Mr. Flannery to attend that committee. The issue of lobbying is not a new phenomenon and is not a new problem.

The forthcoming legislation will provide that when somebody walks in the door to see a Minister or a departmental official, there will be a record of what was asked for, who asked for it and on whose behalf. Second, where people are lobbying on a professional basis, whether paid or remunerated in some way, there will be a register of those lobbyists which will identify who the lobbyists are, on whose behalf they are acting, how much they are getting paid, who they are lobbying, what they are asking for and who stands to benefit from it.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	92	The Taoiseach is meeting the British Prime Minister today and I understand they will discuss trade, energy supplies and the North. In the wake of remarks last week by the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, I hope the Taoiseach will remind the British Prime Minister of the London Government's outstanding obligations to the peace process. Among other issues, the British Government has failed to implement key parts of the Good Friday Agreement, including Acht na Gaeilge, the civic forum, the bill of rights, and other equality and human rights issues. The British Government has also refused to establish an inquiry into the murder of the human rights lawyer, Pat Finucane, the Ballymurphy massacre, or to hand over files concerning the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, despite a call by the Oireachtas to do so. More significantly, we are now entering the third month since Dr. Richard Haass and Professor Meghan O'Sullivan presented proposals which followed lengthy discussions with political parties and others. The Tánaiste knows that the UUP has rejected these proposals, while the DUP has yet to support them. The proposals are largely supported by Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.Recent history teaches us that the Unionist parties will move positively and address issues only if encouraged by both Governments to do so. Running away from the Richard Haass proposals will not achieve anything but instead will encourage those who are against progress. Will the Taoiseach make it clear to the British Prime Minister that negative engagement by London and rowing back on commitments by it is deeply unhelpful?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	As Deputy Adams said, the Taoiseach is meeting the British Prime Minister today. This is now part of a regular, annual summit meeting between the Taoiseach of this country and the Prime Minister of Britain to discuss issues around our bilateral relationship. The issues of trade, tourism, investment, our bilateral relations and the issue of Northern Ireland will form part of those discussions. Immediate issues need to be addressed. I am disappointed - as I am sure is Deputy Adams - that there has been insufficient progress in the discussions following the work done by Dr. Haass and Dr. O'Sullivan prior to the new year. I was reasonably satisfied that progress was being made in the discussions among the party leaders in Northern Ireland. That progress has, to some extent, been derailed recently arising from the Downey judgment and the subsequent controversy and fallout. I would hope that following the St. Patrick's Day period it will be possible to get those discussions back on track and to make progress again because the three critical issues which arise in that area include how to deal with the issue of flags and identity, how to deal with the controversy surrounding parading and how to deal with the very controversial area of the past. These are issues that have to be grappled with. I have discussed these issues on a number of occasions since the new year with the Secretary of State and as recently as yesterday. I plan to meet her again following the St. Patrick's Day events and I hope that it will be possible shortly after the St. Patrick's Day period to have the regular quad meeting which the Secretary of State and I have with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The meeting is overdue. The format of this meeting will be a useful forum in which to try to bring things back on track.  As Deputy Adams said, there are issues about non-implementation. There is unfinished business from the agreements which the Irish Government continues to pursue with the British Government.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	The Tánaiste will know that the concern is that the Unionist parties, in particular, the Democratic Unionist Party, have put back the issues and the proposals from Dr. Richard Haass and Dr. Megan O'Sullivan until after the local government elections, which means until June, which is the marching season. There needs to be a very particular focus. It is not even that the British Government has been disengaged - I would be the last person to complain about British Government disengagement from Ireland - rather its engagement has been negative instead of being therapeutic or positive. As I have already enunciated and the Tánaiste has acknowledged, it has been in breach of agreements made in international treaties and in other agreements between this Government and the London Government and between people across the island. The Tánaiste referred to the Downey judgment. The issue of on-the-runs, OTRs, is one of several legacy issues common to all conflict resolution processes. It is not solely an Irish issue because it arises wherever efforts are made to move from conflict into peace. The two Governments agreed in the Weston Park Agreement some long time ago that the issue would be resolved. However, it is a very graphic example of an issue that has not been resolved despite entreaties and representations by Sinn Féin over the years. It still arises and is used to negative effect on the process with a resultant stall. Will the Tánaiste agree that there has to be a very basic principle in peace-keeping that when agreements are made and commitments given, they have to be kept and that this must be a primary ongoing tenacious forensic focus of this Government with its counterparts in London, that they have to keep the agreements they made?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	I agree that when agreements are made they have to be kept. I also think it is important that the two Governments continue to work hand in hand and jointly with regard to the Northern Ireland peace process. I have a good working relationship with the Secretary of State. We talk regularly in the institutional format that I have described. There is a very good working relationship at official level. I believe it is very important that the two Governments, who are the joint guarantors of the agreements, should work together and I hope this will continue to be the case. Deputy Adams referred to the issue of the OTRs which has been the subject of public discussion arising from the Downey case. There was an understanding at Weston Park that this would be a follow-on issue from the arrangements made as part of the Good Friday Agreement. To be fair, there was an attempt to legislate for it. The Deputy will be aware of the legislation that former Secretary of State, Peter Hain, brought forward in 2005 to 2006. Agreement was not reached with regard to that legislation, arising from which administrative arrangements were put in place to deal with the issue. I am encouraged by what the Prime Minister, David Cameron, said when he was questioned about this. He said he does not wish to unpick difficult decisions made by the previous British Government as part of the peace process. It is important that there should be no unpicking of difficult decisions made and arrangements put in place. We need to build and to move on. The issue we need to address, in the post-St. Patrick's Day period, is the continuation of the Haass-O'Sullivan talks. It is not satisfactory to the Irish Government that this is an issue that is parked until after the elections in May because, as Deputy Adams observed, if we do so we will be in the marching season. One of the critical issues which is part of that discussion is how to deal with the contentious issue of parades. There is also the issue of the hurt from the legacy of the past for families and survivors which continues to emerge on a very regular basis and which must be addressed. I discussed the situation with the Secretary of State as recently as yesterday. The approach of the Irish Government will be to try to get things back on track as quickly as possible after the St. Patrick's Day period.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I have a number of issues I would like to raise with the Tánaiste but I will concentrate on media reports last week about returns by Apple Sales International which is the Irish subsidiary of Apple based in Cork. While Apple Sales International is an unlimited company in Ireland and is not obliged to make annual returns to the Companies Office, it is obliged to make returns in Australia. According to those returns, in the years 2004 to 2009, Apple was able to cut its tax bill by referring to an income tax at lower rates. In these years, Apple calculated its tax with reference to the Irish rate of 12.5% corporate profit tax. It should have paid $890 million but instead only paid $36 million to the Irish Exchequer. The sum of €36 million is close to the 2% rate which Apple claimed at the US Senate hearings last year was an arrangement with Ireland. In the accounts for the period from 2004 to 2009, Apple does not claim to be using its stateless tax designation; it claims to have availed of income tax at lower rates. Even a very powerful multinational company such as Apple cannot set up its own tax rates. A number of questions arise from last week's revelation in Australia.Was Apple able to avail of a rate lower than 12.5% between 2004 and 2009 and, if so, what rate was applied and who decided on this lower rate? We are all very aware that the loophole which allowed not just Apple but a range of large multinationals effectively to avoid tax will close from January next year. My question relates specifically to the returns made by Apple in Australia for the years 2004 to 2009 and its claim that it availed of a lower rate of tax in Ireland, a claim the Government has repeatedly refuted in the past year.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	The issue of effective tax rates has been the subject of a number of public discussions in the past 12 months. It has been acknowledged by the OECD, the European Union and the G20 that international tax planning is an international issue, and the Government is working with these organisations to reach a solution. The recent coverage of multinational profits by Apple was based on historical accounts from 2004 to 2009 which used a stateless company structure. We addressed the issue of stateless companies in budget 2014 and the Government is fully committed to the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project. The OECD is progressing that project, with the support of the G20, to deal with this international issue. There has been an allegation that Apple had some type of special deal with Ireland. We have consistently rejected that allegation. Indeed, Mr. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, corrected the record in that regard in May last year when he stated at the All Things Digital D10 conference, "We have no special deal with the Irish Government". With regard to the allegation that Apple paid only $36 million of tax on profits of $7.11 billion, it is important to clarify that there are two separate scenarios that are often confused in discussions on the effective rate of corporation tax. The first is the global rate of tax that is paid by multinational companies which operate across a number jurisdictions. This is a blended rate which takes into account the amount of tax charged across all countries in which a company trades, not just in Ireland. The extremely low effective rate figures that were recently quoted in Apple's case and attributed to Ireland are based on a flawed premise. They are estimated by dividing the amount of Irish tax paid by a total profit figure that includes substantial profits made by companies that are not tax resident in Ireland. The figures are running together the profits earned by group companies in Ireland and in other jurisdictions and incorrectly suggesting that Irish tax does or should apply to both. Ireland cannot tax profits that are properly attributable to other jurisdictions. The ability of some multinationals to lower their worldwide rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and all other countries operate. The best way to address this issue effectively is for countries to work together at international level. The appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of its project on base erosion and profit shifting. Ireland is participating fully in that process. The second issue is the effective rate of tax applying in individual countries. The domestic rate of tax paid in Ireland is within the control of the Irish tax system, and Ireland is responsible for the amount of Irish corporation tax that is charged here. All companies operating in Ireland, both domestic businesses and multinationals, are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%. Some other countries have a higher headline rate of corporation tax, which is supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs that reduce the overall rate of tax paid. By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent. We have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax, which is applied to a broad base.

The fact of the matter is that Apple Sales International's returns in Australia show that it was able to cut its tax bill by availing of lower rates of tax on income, which was a reference to the 12.5% tax on corporate profits in Ireland. Something does not add up here. The Tánaiste cannot on the one hand say there is no such thing as reduced rates and, on the other hand, that there is, in fact, some way in which companies can get around it. It is quite evident what is happening here - €36 million was paid by Apple to the Irish Exchequer. That money has to have come from somewhere and it did not come from the 12.5% corporation tax. The company is not domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes, so why was that sum paid? The Tánaiste's answer is not good enough and it does not add up. Someone is telling porkies here. The Tánaiste and Apple management should get together and present a proper response to this question.

We have a 12.5% rate of corporation tax. It is statute-based and applies to profits that are earned in Ireland. It is applied consistently. We did have a problem with the issue of the stateless company. The Government recognised that loophole in our tax system and, last October, when we brought in the budget for 2014, we addressed and resolved it by ending the concept of stateless companies. There is an international issue around corporation tax whereby multinational companies which operate across a number of jurisdictions are able to plan their tax affairs in a way that minimises their tax contribution globally. This is an issue that has to be tackled on an international basis. The OECD, of which we are a member, is working on it by way of the base erosion and profit shifting project it undertook some time ago. Ireland is participating in that project, which has the support of the G20 and the European Union. This is a problem that has to be addressed at an international level. I was at the OECD only a few weeks ago, along with the Taoiseach and other Ministers, where we discussed the progress that is being made on this issue. We want to see this issue addressed at a global level, and the appropriate body through which it can be addressed is the OECD. That organisation is making progress and we are working with it to that end.

The programme for Government outlined an ambitious agenda for political reform. While the Government’s main focus since coming to office has rightly been on job creation and economic recovery, we have also used our time in office to set about making some long overdue reforms to the political system. I propose to highlight a few of the key political reforms that have been introduced over the past three years. We established the Convention on the Constitution to make recommendations for constitutional change. Despite scepticism from the Opposition and some commentators, the 100 members of the convention - 33 parliamentarians, 66 citizens selected at random and the independent chair, Mr. Tom Arnold - have silenced the critics. The convention has been a great success. The Government has committed to holding three referendums in 2015 arising from its recommendations. Corporate donations have been restricted by legislation. The maximum amount that a political party or an individual can accept as a political donation has been limited. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has linked State supports to political parties to the gender balance in candidate selection at general elections. This is a positive step to encourage more women into politics. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is restoring the freedom of information legislation and reversing the damage done to that legislation by a previous Government in 2003. The Government has also extended the jurisdiction and powers of the Ombudsman. The most radical reform of local government in over 100 years will see the dissolution of 80 town councils and the merger of six city or county councils in counties Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary. This will significantly reduce the total number of councillors. Councillors will have a more important role in how local authorities are run. There will be much greater local authority involvement in economic and community development. We are committed to a programme of Oireachtas reform, which is being introduced on a phased basis over the lifetime of this Government. No parliament is perfect. The process of parliamentary reform is always an ongoing one. The reforms introduced since this Government took office in March 2011 have improved the working of the Oireachtas and allowed Oireachtas committees to play a more active role in our Parliament. This is not the end of the process. Work has already started on the next phase. The first phase of the Dáil reform programme was introduced in the summer of 2011. It provided for an additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, taken by the Tánaiste. Topical Issues debates replaced the outmoded Adjournment debates. Friday sittings were introduced to allow Deputies to introduce their own Bills. Deputies can now appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if they are unhappy with the replies received to parliamentary questions. The Oireachtas committee system was restructured by reducing the number of committees from 25 to 16. Provision was made for a system of pre-legislative review. Further reforms to the Oireachtas committee system were introduced in the summer of 2012 to streamline its structure and place an additional focus on priority areas for economic recovery, such as jobs and agriculture. The Government announced the second phase of the Dáil reform programme in September 2013. The Dáil debated and approved changes to Standing Orders the following month. These reforms provide for more public involvement in the law-making process and include a new pre-legislative stage for all non-emergency legislation. A Minister who does not bring a Bill to a committee for pre-legislative stage will be required to explain that decision to the Dáil. The pre-legislative stage will allow for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law-making. The relevant committee will be able to consult experts and civic society. Crucially, this will take place before the legislation is drafted. If there has been a pre-legislative stage, the Chairman, Vice Chairman or a member of the relevant committee will have a right equal to that of the Minister and the Opposition spokespersons to speak in the Dáil to outline the committee's work. We have also introduced a new system for the drafting and enactment of legislation. We have reduced the number of legislation programmes to two per year. The Dáil sitting day is being lengthened to increase the time available to debate legislation. These steps are resulting in a reduction in the use of the guillotine. A new system of post-legislative review, whereby a Minister will report to the relevant Oireachtas committee within 12 months of the enactment of an Act to review it, is being introduced. We have taken steps to improve debates on legislation. On First Stage, the proposer of a Private Members' Bill now has five minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill. As I have mentioned, during the Second Stage debate on a Bill, the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the committee which considered the Bill at pre-legislative stage will have a speaking slot to report to the Dáil on the committee's findings. We have made changes to Friday sittings. The Dáil now sits every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bills and committee reports. This allows more Deputies to have their Bills debated in the Dáil and allows Oireachtas committee reports to be debated in the Dáil. Private Members' Bills and committee reports are selected using a lottery system. A Minister or Minister of State speaks during the debate to outline the Government’s response. As the House will be aware, Deputies have responded positively to these changes. Just 14 Private Members' Bills were published by Deputies in 2010, but this number had increased to 58 by last year. This Government has accepted more Bills from Opposition and Government Deputies than any of its predecessors. Two Bills from Opposition Deputies were accepted by the Government last week. We have substantially changed the way the House conducts its business generally. The Government’s priorities for the year ahead are outlined to the Dáil on an annual basis. This has been happening over the past week. Under this new procedure, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste address the Dáil setting out the Government’s annual priorities, each Minister sets out his or her Department’s plans for the future and Deputies have an opportunity to debate the Government priorities for the year. The role of Oireachtas committees in the budget process will also be expanded. The stability programme update is presented by the Government to the EU in April of each year. Committees can review this information and report before the budget in October. The budget and the spending Estimates will be published in October. Committees will scrutinise the budget proposals and the Estimates earlier than they did in the past. The system of debating Topical Issues has also been improved. A Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department replies to each matter raised during Topical Issue debates. A Deputy can ask to have the matter deferred until a Minister from the relevant Department is available. It will be given priority at that stage. Changes have also been made to Dáil questions. An ordinary oral question is now answered only if the Deputy tabling the question is in the Chamber when it is reached. The Deputy is given a brief period of 30 seconds to outline the question. An Opposition spokesperson can no longer nominate questions in the name of other Deputies. However, he or she can submit five ordinary questions on his or her own behalf. The number of Dáil sitting days has been increased significantly by reducing the length of the Dáil recesses and introducing additional sitting days. The Dáil sat for 303 days during this Government’s first two and a half years in office. By comparison, the Dáil sat for 229 days during the first two and a half years in office of the previous Government, which was a coalition between Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats. This shows an increase of 74 sitting days, or 32.3%. The Government's proposals for operational reform of the Seanad, which will be implemented in the life of this Seanad, have been submitted for discussion to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The proposals focus on the Seanad's legislative and vocational roles and acknowledge its role with regard to EU scrutiny. The proposals also suggest ways in which the Seanad can engage with the Government and work jointly with the Dáil through the Oireachtas committee system. With regard to electoral reform of the Seanad, last month the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government published for consultation the general scheme of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill 2014, to implement the 1979 amendment to Article 18.4.2° of the Constitution on the election of Members of Seanad Éireann by higher education institutions in this State. The main features of the general scheme are the establishment of a single six-Member constituency to replace the current two university constituencies and an extension of the franchise to include graduates from third level educational institutions that have not formed part of the Seanad Éireann university constituencies before now. The franchise will apply to the holders of a major award validated by an awards body in the State and recognised through the national qualifications framework as being at least at ordinary bachelor degree level. Other technical provisions for the organisation of elections include the creation of a register of electors, the appointment of a returning officer and the making of arrangements for taking the poll and counting the votes. Alternative arrangements are being made for the nomination of candidates to bring them into line with reforms made in other electoral codes. The new provisions for the filling of casual vacancies will be based on the replacement candidates list system that operates for European Parliament elections in Ireland. Copies of the general scheme have been sent for consideration to the Seanad, which I understand will be discussing it this week. Copies of the general scheme have been also sent to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and stakeholders, including the institutions of higher education in the State. The general scheme has also been placed on the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's website for public consultation and the deadline for receipt of written submissions is 11 April 2014. I trust Deputies will agree this represents a substantial body of reform but, as I said at the outset, the process is ongoing and more reforms are contemplated over the lifetime of the Government.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	I thank the Minister of State for a very underwhelming reply to my question. I do not at all accept that what he has put before us is a radical series of Dáil reform or Oireachtas reform measures. The programme for Government stated that the people demanded change and looked to parties that would deliver the change they sought. The people are very disappointed at the lack of any radical change to how we do politics in this country and in particular changes to how the Oireachtas does its business. Fundamentally, people thought the Parliament would be freed from the stranglehold of the Executive, the Government of the day, but the opposite has been the case. The Government, through its huge majority in the Dáil, has made this Dáil a creature of the Cabinet to a degree we have not previously experienced. The greatest example of that has been the frequent use of the guillotine on sensitive and controversial Bills to spare the blushes of Government backbenchers and particularly Labour Party backbenchers. This has applied to very significant issues such as the property tax on two occasions. More than 12 months ago, all Stages of the legislation underpinning the property tax were rushed through this House in a matter of about three hours to prevent debate. The same has applied to successive social welfare Bills. There was no debate on controversial issues such as child benefit and the Bills were just rammed through the House. Time and time again the Government orders the schedule of the House, decides what gets debated and for how long. The Minister of State talked about Friday sittings which are a sham. He should not present that as radical reform. People can certainly produce Bills - the Opposition has been very productive in the publication of Bills. However, the Government is not accepting Bills. It occasionally allows them to pass Second Stage and then buries them. It took years to get Senator Quinn's subcontractor's Bill passed.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	There was the wonderful proposal to abolish the Seanad, if the Deputy remembers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	I was coming to that. The Government accepted our Bill on the IBRC mortgage book being sold on because it felt it would be too unpopular to oppose it, but it will not do anything about it, particularly in advance of the sale of the mortgage book. We will not see the Committee Stage of that Bill for some time. That is the strategy. Friday sittings should be full-day sittings, involving Leaders' Questions and ministerial questions - normal business should be done. People would respect the Government more if that were the case, but of course it is not the case. Of course Government Deputies dominate the Chairs of the committees. The Government has reduced the number of committees which has meant less accountability in many areas. It has put too many Departments together under the auspices of one committee and many issues are not getting addressed. The Government has undermined the plenary session of the House. Deputies need an opportunity to contribute in plenary session on many issues. The Minister of State mentioned local government reform. The Government has not reformed local government. It has not delegated any increased or enhanced powers to local government. It has abolished town councils, which is a regrettable step. I value democracy. I was in a school yesterday, encouraging young people to become interested in democracy and politics. What kind of message are we sending to people when we abolish the very councils that are basically a manifestation of people who want to help to advance the cause of their local towns? It was just done for optics so that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, can go around the country saying we have got rid of hundreds of councillors. It is an appallingly cynical act that cannot in any shape or form be regarded as radical reform of local government. There has been no radical reform of local government. The Government introduced a property tax and decided not to give the proceeds of that property tax to the local authorities. The Government informed citizens that €500 million would go to local authorities, but then it pulled it back to the centre and left them without it. The Minister of State mentioned the Seanad and again the Government has not grasped the nettle of Seanad reform. The fundamental reforming issue within the Government's gift is to provide for direct franchise to allow the citizens to elect their Senators. It can do that; every Opposition party is in favour of it. We have put it up to the Government to do that and it continues to refuse to do so. It talks about a CPP of the Seanad - that will not bring about radical reform to the Seanad. Legislation within the parameters of the Constitution to allow for direct franchise would bring about radical reform of the Seanad, but the Government will not go near it - or will it? Can the Minister of State confirm that the Government has no intention of doing that? In his long reply the Minister of State mentioned the Freedom of Information Act. There is no radical change to freedom of information. The Government's intentions were exposed on Irish Water. I recently saw the revelations under freedom of information which showed that the Government had decided not to include Irish Water. It basically had been pressurised by Bord Gáis Éireann and Irish Water that whatever it might do it must not put Irish Water within the ambit of the Act. Shame faced it was forced to do a U-turn when revelations about the €180 million spent on Irish Water emerged. All of a sudden it decided it would be a very good idea to put Irish Water under the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act. There is a complete lack of sincerity in what the Minister of State has said about the Freedom of Information Act and whistleblowing in general. Why has the Government issued a contract to general practitioners gagging them and preventing them from advocating on health matters? The contract for free GP care for children under six prevents GPs from making any statement critical of the HSE. That is anti-democratic and runs counter to any idea of a democratic revolution. Its purpose is to silence people who might speak out on health issues thereby embarrassing the Government of the day and in particular the present Government on health issues. That is what is happening in the real world. When people hear the Government talking about radical political reform, they wonder in amazement given the reality of what they are experiencing on the ground. Does the Minister of State accept that the Government's programme of reform has been a huge disappointment to the citizens who feel they were promised one thing and got something entirely different?

His Government committed to it and we had a timeline to introduce property tax legislation which is why it was guillotined. I have been a Member of this House since 2002 and in that time we have not had a full debate on a social welfare Bill; it always has been guillotined. It was the same guillotine the Government, of which Deputy Martin was a member, applied when it cut the blind pension. It did not allow a debate on that when I was in opposition. It is not appropriate for him to come in here and start lecturing about what he is doing. It frustrates me to have to use the guillotine, but I am happy we have not used it in this session so far.We used it on three occasions between September and December in the previous session. This Government is committed to reducing the use of the guillotine. Parliaments will always need to have a mechanism to introduce, debate and conclude legislation, but I want to make the use of the guillotine the exception. There is not a parliament in the world that does not have to guillotine emergency legislation or other legislation, but I want to make guillotining the debate on Bills the exception. It is frustrating for both Opposition and Government Deputies that they are not able to participate in some debates on legislation but I want to make it the exception that Bills are guillotined. I hope the Deputy will understand that we had a timeline in terms of the troika commitments and that we had to bring in legislation on which the guillotine was used, but I want to make that the exception in the future. The Deputy was a Minister for a long time and he will understand the reason the guillotine has to be used. It has been used in this Parliament for decades but I want to reverse that and introduce a better system. That is the reason we have increased the number of Dáil sitting days and increased the sitting hours on a daily basis to ensure more time is given to legislative debate. We have a more streamlined legislative programme than the one previously in that we now have two schedules instead of three covering the session from January to the summer recess at the end of July and the session from September to December. I believe that will streamline legislation and curtail guillotines but I do not want to have any guillotines used in the House. The Deputy referred to the Government setting the agenda for the week. The Government has to set the agenda but it is an open and transparent system where the Whips meet once a week and, as Government Whip, I present a schedule for the week. I accept that changes are made on occasions but the Government must get through its business and legislation, whatever that may be, but I am always open to debate on it and to alternative arrangements. That has always been my position, and I have never put down anyone for offering an alternative to that. The Opposition Members will not get their way all the time but I would like the business to be agreed before it comes to the House the following week. I understand the point. I was in opposition long enough. It is up to the Opposition Members to oppose the Government taking business on some occasions. That is their job, and I understand that. I will not say the Members opposite should not do that. On the issue of Friday sittings, if Friday sittings were not as successful as they are, there would not be the number of Private Members' Bills being submitted on a weekly basis by both Opposition and Government Deputies. It is a great opportunity for Deputies to bring forward Private Members' Bills, regardless of the issue. It is a Member's right. They are elected to this Parliament to bring forward Private Members' Bills. We have never had that opportunity previously.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	We have always had it.

In the past, if a back bench Deputy wanted to bring forward a Private Members' Bill, he or she could place it on the Order Paper where it remained for years and they never had an opportunity to debate it. The Opposition parties, be it Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or whatever party was in opposition at the time, would bring forward their own Private Members' Bills in Private Members' time on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. That is the way it was done. They would decide the previous week whatever the burning issue of the week was and debate it in their Private Members' time the following week. It is incorrect to say that Friday sittings are not a success. Regarding the changes in the committee system and reducing the number of committees, committees are far busier and are working better now than they were previously. Their workload has increased no end. Members are busy on committees now and they have issues to debate in committees. The Seanad is a priority for this Government. We brought forward draft legislation which has gone to the committee and to the Seanad for consideration, and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will bring it before the House very soon. It is part of the legislative process to implement the 1979 amendment to Article 18.4.2°. It is the general scheme of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill 2014. We are the first Government since 1979 to bring forward an amendment to Article 18.4.2°. No other Government has bothered to bring such legislation forward. We are doing that to extend voting rights in Seanad elections to graduates of third level institutions.

As one who has spent some time as Opposition Chief Whip and assistant Whip and who attended Whips meetings in Government and afterwards, there appears to be a conflict as to where the House should go now. Consideration might be given to the fact that there are quite a number of Government backbenchers who do not get the same airing in the current structure, nor is it intended that they should. The former Minister sitting opposite will recall full well the way the system ran in a previous era, but the conflict arises from the fact that with all the pre-legislative scrutiny, there appears to be a belief that the Opposition should formulate the legislation and that the Government should agree to it. That is not the way it works. It never worked that way, nor should it be presumed. The very reference to the Government having a huge majority, implying that in some way the democratic process is not being observed, is incorrect. The Ceann Comhairle has been a Member a long time, as have some of the rest of us, and I recall sitting on the opposite side of the House on numerous occasions having parliamentary question after parliamentary question refused on spurious grounds and being ejected from the House for my protests. I reject entirely the suggestion that democracy has in some way been watered down and that people do not have an opportunity to debate issues. It is recognised in parliaments worldwide that government proposes legislation and parliament debates it. We have lost sight of that in recent times. Parliament's job is to debate. When a proposal comes before parliament, that is the job parliamentarians have to do. There are various levels at which they can carry it out but I remember allegations being made about guillotines. In times not long past the guillotine was applied on a regular basis in this House by some of the people who are now complaining about its use-----

I welcome some of the Minister's changes in terms of Dáil reform and the way the Houses of the Oireachtas are working but Government backbenchers now have as much of a role in the pre-legislative stage, for example, as anybody else.They can attend committees, like every other Member of the House, they can publish legislation and have it debated on a par with myself, an Opposition spokesperson, and they can put oral questions. In fact, they probably have a greater chance of getting their oral questions selected than any Deputy other than a spokesperson-----

I would encourage the Minister of State to correct the interpretation Deputy Durkan has taken. The Minister of State mentioned guillotines. I would encourage him to list the Bills that were guillotined in the last session, one of which was the Social Welfare Bill. Regretfully, that Bill was guillotined by the Government for no reason to do with a lack of time in this House or lack of Government time. The Minister of State might inform the Dáil of the real reason the Social Welfare Bill was guillotined in the last session, which was because the Government was afraid of the lack of a Seanad majority. In regard to the topic under discussion, what are the specific proposals we will see forthcoming on Dáil reform and political reform? There have been a number of Dáil reform meetings and some technical changes have been suggested, as well as some major changes. Perhaps the Houses of the Oireachtas and all Members would be interested in that. Has consideration been given to changing the make-up of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to ensure all political groupings in the Houses are represented on the body that takes key decisions on the running and the expenditure of the Houses? I have put forward other proposals at Dáil reform meetings and, while I am not asking the Minister of State to say yes or no immediately, all of the Whips and all of the parties have published suggestions for legislative change, Dáil reform and political reform. Hopefully, these questions will stimulate that debate once again. With regard to the Constitutional Convention, when is it intended to have the debates on the most recent reports? I believe the fourth report is to be debated at some stage this month. If that does not happen, we will be running contrary to the remit that each convention's report had to be debated within four months of the Dáil receiving it. I know that report was received in November so there is a need for that debate. Are there plans for political reform in regard to the local authorities? The Government has already made major changes, mostly to the detriment of democracy, in terms of reducing the powers of local authorities and adding quangos to the list of existing quangos. Is it intended at some stage to give some of the power back to local authorities or will more and more power be centralised, not in the Houses of the Oireachtas but in the Executive, given these groups are answerable only to the Minister and are not answerable to this House? Is there any intention to allow Deputies to put written parliamentary questions during periods of recess to ensure the Executive is still answerable to both Opposition and back bench Deputies? We need to continue the work of scrutinising legislation and ensuring the Executive is answerable to the Dáil even when the Dáil is not formally sitting, for example when it is adjourned during the summer months. There are a number of other issues. I hope the Minister of State will be able to outline some of the timetable of the political reform and Dáil reform that was intended when the Government took office, not all of which I agree with, but some of which I have already welcomed.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	In the context of the questions raised, I am a newcomer to the Dáil and I am very honoured and privileged to serve the people - the whole people - of this country. However, I was shocked last year when, for example, in the Seanad and Dáil debates on the proposed abolition of the Seanad, a weird situation seemed to arise where the debates were not meaningful but were meaningless because a party whip was imposed on all Members of Government parties that they had to vote in a certain way. That is meaningless in a Parliament - it is illogical. The Minister of State's own party is one that signed up the European People's Party's document of principles of two years ago, the title of which escapes me. Article 155 of that document has the meaning that, as a member and a signatory to the document, Fine Gael purports to uphold the principle of conscientious objection. It is a fundamental democratic principle that has been jettisoned. It is weird. I would like an answer to that question. The leadership of parties should not ever have iron fist control, down to blind obedience, over their members. That is unparliamentary, it is undemocratic and it is not right. This has to be examined because, otherwise, we are living in an unreality bubble where, if the numbers say so, the Government has complete control until the next election. That is wrong. Even in the most liberal countries, the principle of conscientious objection is upheld, but not in this Parliament.

Deputy Mathews sat in the same room as me in April 2011 and supported the programme for Government, which included the referendum to abolish the Seanad. I have a fairly good memory.

I look forward to that. I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for welcoming some of the changes. I also thank him for his participation in the process. It was a joint approach by all involved, and some of his proposals were taken on board, as were the views of other Members. I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for the extensive submission on Dáil reform made very early on in the process by the Sinn Féin Party. Deputy Durkan took exception to one point made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. I have spoken to Deputy Durkan on this issue. The position is that Opposition spokespersons dealing with a specific Department are allowed to ask five oral questions whereas a Government backbencher is curtailed to asking two. This was one part of the reforms. I was in opposition for long enough and I believe we have to give status and some sort of recognition to Opposition spokespersons, who put a huge amount of work into each area, whether it be jobs, agriculture, social welfare or otherwise. I am a believer in recognising the role of Opposition spokespersons in trying to hold the Executive or the Minister to account. Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about specific proposals for the future.A committee week is one specific proposal at which I am looking and about which I have spoken to the Taoiseach. It is something to which I would have been totally opposed a while back but I am gradually coming to favour it. I have looked at other parliaments that have a specific committee week once every five or six weeks. This works extremely well. If one looks at the pressures and workload of all committees, and Deputy Martin spoke about them, one can see that there is a huge amount of pressure on committee members. They are not racing from one committee to another but their workload has increased and almost doubled from what it was in the previous Dáil. We must look at committees, how they work, the membership and their workload and how if there is a committee week, a committee could use the Dáil Chamber during Committee Stage of a Bill or something like that. They would be not bringing guest speakers into the Dáil but they could use it for specific areas of work. I would like to see a committee week introduced and it is something I will bring forward. Two Social Welfare Bills and the Irish Water Bill were guillotined between September and December 2013. I may be corrected on that but I am almost certain that they are the three Bills that were guillotined. Since 2002, I have never seen a Social Welfare Bill being fully debated. It has always been guillotined.

The Deputy should check the record. I was Opposition Chief Whip since 2004 and I can assure the Deputy that I have looked back at the record. Every Social Welfare Bill since I came into this House in 2002 has been guillotined. We spoke about the Constitutional Convention and the debates coming up. We are making time available. The convention reported back to the Minister who will bring a memorandum to Cabinet shortly. As soon as the memorandum is brought to Cabinet, we will have those outstanding debates in the Dáil. The convention was extremely important and worked very well. I would have liked to have seen the topics discussed at the convention given more time in the Dáil. Some of them were very important. Due to time pressures relating to troika commitments in the past two and a half years, they did not get the debate that I felt they deserved. When one sees 66 members of the public giving their time on Friday nights, Saturdays and Sundays, they were interested enough in coming together with Deputies. This is something about which I was very sceptical when it originated. I wondered whether Deputies would stay out of their constituencies once a month on Friday night, Saturday and Sunday. In fairness, they did so. There was a huge turnout of Deputies, Senators and parliamentarians in general from North and South. I welcomed that and I thank both the Opposition and Government Deputies for their commitment to the Constitutional Convention for the past two years because it worked extremely well. I believe this Government and future Governments can look at it. It was a good way of debating our Constitution. Some real and controversial issues were brought forward in a completely different manner from that used in the past. It was good to see that working. I assure the House that I will give the outstanding issues that must be debated plenty of time in the Dáil. The Deputy mentioned parliamentary questions being answered in the summer. This has been an issue since I entered the House. I do not think it is as much of an issue as it used to be. When I first entered the House, we finished up in late June and came back on the last Wednesday in September, so one was off for almost three months. We are now off for six weeks. We finish the last week in July, have four weeks off in August and are back here in the second week in September. I understand that Ministers want to see replies to parliamentary questions going through their Departments. When a parliamentary question is replied to, the Minister would like to see it. Everyone understands they are away for August. We would like to see it but that is the way it is. If Ministers are on holidays, they are on holidays and that is the way it is. I would like the Deputy to accept that and understand where I am coming from when I say that.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	The Minister of State needs to clarify urgently in a statement what access he had to the Cabinet meetings of previous Governments. I put it to him that, of course, there has been rolling Dáil reform. It includes the ending of the dual mandate between local government and the Dáil. The bringing in of Leaders' Questions was an initiative of a previous Government. Initiatives like the establishment of the Standards in Public Office Commission constituted political reform around the financing of politics and the changes to donations and the thresholds around it, so the assertion that nothing happened in terms of political reform is completely wrong and untrue. During the general election, every political party said there would be very radical change in how Parliament operates, but the people have been disappointed in terms of what they were promised and the commitments that were made to them. I put it to the Minister of State that what would constitute radical reform would be permitting the appointment of Ministers who are not necessarily Members of the Oireachtas so that people with particular expertise in certain policy areas could be invited to serve in the Cabinet by a future Taoiseach. One can do that already. One could change the law to allow Ministers of State to be invited in from external sectors. That is the kind of issue we should be debating in terms of re-connecting with the public's wish for reform of how we do our work. We are unique as a Legislature in that we insist that a person must be a Member of the Oireachtas to be a member of Cabinet, a Minister. That is something the Government could change. I am not talking about any individuals but the office of An Ceann Comhairle in future Parliaments could be elected by secret ballot. The idea would be to generate a separate corporate identity for the Parliament vis-à-vis the Government of the day because we need more oversight.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	179	Fine. I accept that. An argument has been put forward in the public domain to which I now subscribe and have included in my party's policy, which we submitted to the Government, to the effect that, in future, it would be good for the Parliament if it elected the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot. People might disagree with that view, but it is a legitimate suggestion for parliamentary reform. That is the context in which I made the suggestion. It is the concept of who guards the guards. I do not mean the Garda, but oversight by the regulators. There is no strong parliamentary oversight committee in this House. The only aspect of financial regulation that has changed has been the personalities. In terms of how regulators behave, the fundamental structure and relationship between Parliament and regulation has not changed at all. This principle has not been addressed in the context of political reform. As to the idea of the Parliament having its own identity and challenging the Executive of the day, regardless of who comprises the Executive, people want this kind of fundamental change, not the changes that this Government only makes for the optics. The Minister of State's feeble attempt to put down Deputy Mathews illustrates my point. It is not a question of whether the Deputy belongs to a new technical group. That is not the point he was making. It is wrong that Governments should decide that people cannot sit on committees because they objected to Government proposals of the day. A Government backbencher can be expelled from a party if that is the Government's wish, but he or she might have been serving well on a health or finance committee for two years. Just because he or she has had one disagreement with the Government on an issue, this Government decides to remove the person from a committee.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	The only reason the Social Welfare Bill was guillotined under this Government was the fact that there were too many draconian cuts and broken promises on, for example, child benefit.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	The Deputy will appreciate that this is Question Time, not statements.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	That is why it was guillotined.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	Would Deputy Durkan please stay quiet?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	205	Then leave the Chamber.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	Regarding the Order Paper and so on, the Minister of State claims that the Government must propose to change them. Consider what happened last week.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	208	Will the Deputy put his questions, please? This is Question Time, not statements.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	I am putting the question. Consider what happened last week. In fairness, the Minister of State was never a great fan of the North Korean way of doing things. Maybe the Tánaiste was in his student days. Last week was extraordinary. Everyone was invited to sing the praises of our dear leader. We all had to genuflect and say, "How great thou art".
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	210	Is that the Deputy's question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	211	Not only that, but we will do it again this week.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	212	What is the Deputy's question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	213	It was meant to be about Government priorities, but what did we find out about those? We cannot be told about water charges until after the elections. We cannot be told about universal health insurance until after the elections. We cannot be told about HSE funding of universities until after the elections. That report is buried.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	214	The Deputy is all wrong.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	215	The report on sustaining small schools has been buried. We cannot hear about it either until after the local elections. The democratic revolution has not happened. Will the Minister of State embrace the kind of change that the Government promised before the election, one that would radically reform how politics works in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann? He did not answer my question on the direct franchise. The Government can decide, and would receive the Opposition's support, to change the law to allow the people to elect Senators. Will the Minister of State confirm whether the Government is prepared to proceed with that legislation before the next general election? It would be a major fillip to the concept of reform if we allowed citizens to elect people to the Upper House.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	233	The Minister of State read the minutes, obviously.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	Not true. I did not say that at all.

It used to be a case of jobs for the boys and €10,000 per year under the former Government.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	This Government controls the committees. Bar two, every one of them is chaired by Government Members.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	The property tax was subject to it.

Deputy Martin sat at the Cabinet table from June 1997 until March 2011, yet the only changes that Government made were the introduction of Leaders' Questions and the abolition of the dual mandate. I am not surprised that he is sitting silently in the Chair.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	258	I am not in the Chair.

The Deputy also mentioned water charges. He is trying to twist matters, but people will know well in advance of the local and European elections what they will be charged for water. The Taoiseach has stated this in the Chamber numerous times.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	Has he?

He had it for many years while in government, but now that he is in opposition, he wants to do everything that he claims he would have loved to have done in government, even though he had been there for 14 years.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	262	The Taoiseach stated that he was against water charges while in opposition.

In fairness, the late Mr. Séamus Brennan is the man who introduced Leaders' Questions. He was instrumental.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	Yes. He was the then Chief Whip.

No changes were made from 2002 onwards. It is amazing, but I will rest my case that Deputy Martin has done-----

The Deputy referred to the guillotine, which I am addressing. Only three Bills were guillotined in the session from September to December 2013. There is room for improvement but no Bill has been guillotined since January this year. It is important not to have guillotines in order to give every Member an opportunity to debate legislation.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	283	I note to the Tánaiste that during the last debate I mentioned to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, that while he was no fan of the North Korean way of doing things, there might have been a time during his student days that the Tánaiste had a sneaking regard for the activities in that country.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	Not for North Korea. I question the necessity to resume statements on Government priorities for the year ahead. We have not had a discussion on real priorities. Everything else has been put back, including funding of third level education in respect of which the report has been buried in the HEA. The report on small schools has been buried within the Department and universal health insurance has been mothballed by way of a Green Paper which we will not see for a long time. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, did not even mention the SME crisis last week until Morgan Kelly raised it this week. Suddenly, SMEs represent a real crisis and the Central Bank should look at the issue in terms of debt. We are living in a parallel universe where we were meant to be talking about all of these issues last week, but they did not get discussed. Papers have not been circulated in advance of these discussions. Why is it thought necessary to again have statements on the Government's priorities for the year ahead given that we had them last week? It is a charade. There is no real hunger from anybody on this side of the House for it. Is there a problem with legislation? I understand it was said at the Whips' meeting that there is a logjam or bottleneck and legislation is not coming through. Last week, we had no legislation and this week it is minimal. We have Second Stage of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Bill and only amendments from the Seanad to the ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill. Next week, the Dáil will not sit. For a full three-week period, the Government will have had no substantive legislative programme. What is happening?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	288	What statements?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	Statements on the Government's priorities in the year ahead. We have had a whole week of this and are now into a second. It is not very edifying and is a distraction from getting down to real business as opposed to the Government coming in and reading out whatever happens to be the flavour of the day and then leaving.

I find it remarkable that Deputies Martin and Adams are complaining there was no debate. If there was no debate, it is their fault.

Ethics is missing in many areas. The Taoiseach told the House on 24 April 2013 that he expected a substantial contribution from the leadership of the banks. Yesterday, we were told that Richie Boucher is again on €843,000. There has not been a single cent reduction in his pay despite what the Taoiseach said to the House last year that there would be a substantial contribution.

We spend a huge amount of money on reports.

Given the concerns expressed during and prior to the Mahon tribunal, is it envisaged that the Bill will come before the House at an early date? No. 90 on the list is the insurance Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for the continuing regulation and supervision of the insurance and re-insurance business. Given the need for a viable insurance sector and the necessity to provide insurance cover to various businesses and households, this is important legislation. Has the Cabinet discussed the Bill and, if so, have the heads been approved? When will the legislation come before the House?

The Mahon tribunal also recommended legislation to deal with the issue of lobbying. As I informed the House on Leaders' Questions, the relevant Bill is being progressed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and is expected in the second quarter of this year. At this stage, it is not possible to indicate a date for the insurance Bill.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	325	Tá dhá cheist agam faoi reachtaíocht atá fógartha, the regulation of lobbying Bill, le do thoil, and the health reform Bill. The Tánaiste referred to the regulation of lobbying Bill. Given the ongoing controversy arising from revelations about the Rehab Group and the failure thus far of its former chief executive and Fine Gael Party strategist to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts, when will the legislation be published? In light of this ongoing scandal, will the Government commit to expediting the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas? The purpose of the health reform Bill is to put in place new structures for the health service, as set out in future care, and to disestablish the Health Service Executive. This morning, there are 300 patients on trolleys across the State, the highest number of whom are in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, where the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation-----

When can we expect the Bill before the House? Given that €5 billion has been taken out of the health service, is it not obvious that the Government's health plans are actively undermining its stated goal of achieving equal access to health care?

The Minister has received a copy of the committee's report and it is intended to publish the Bill in the second quarter of the year. Hopefully, it will be dealt with in the House before the summer. Policy issues on the health reform Bill are being formulated. Publication of this complex legislation is expected this session.

Given the high level of advertising and marketing of gambling on television, telephone apps and so forth and the fact that the problem of gambling is becoming increasingly acute, with wives and partners of gambling addicts picketing betting shops and pleading with the various companies involved to put a stop to the misery caused by gambling addiction, this legislation should be front-loaded and a tax imposed on the turnover from betting.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	The House faces into a second week in which the Government will engage in back-slapping and we will not debate substantive legislation. Last June, on the Order of Business, the Taoiseach informed me that the heads of the children first Bill had been passed by the Cabinet and the only reason the legislation had not reached the floor of the House was that legislative pressures were preventing it from being introduced in the House before the summer. He promised that the Bill would be dealt with after the summer recess. The autumn session has come and gone and we are in the month of March. Despite repeated promises to introduce it, the legislation is still awaited. Will the Tánaiste give a clear and definitive timeframe for the introduction of the Bill? The information and tracing Bill has been repeatedly promised by the Government. When will this important legislation come before the House? Statements on social housing have been scheduled for tomorrow. Would it not be more appropriate for the Government to introduce the promised housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to deal with the many anomalies in the sector and the problems many people are experiencing as they seek to be placed on the social housing waiting list?
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	Significant progress has been made in drafting the children first Bill. The relevant committee produced a substantial report of approximately 700 pages in length, which must be considered. It is intended that the Bill will be published in this session. The second Bill to which the Deputy referred will be published later this year. The housing legislation to which he referred is also due in this session.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	There is an urgent need for a really inclusive democracy - based on equality - for citizens throughout Ireland and for those of people who have been forced to leave this country through no fault of their own. The diaspora is an important part of the Irish nation. Tá timpeall 70 milliún saoránaigh ar fud an domhain a deir gur de fhréamhacha Éireannacha iad. Cé gur oileán beag muid, is náisiúin ollmhór muid atá scaipthe ar fud na n-ilchríche. Tá an ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta atá againn faoi láthair ag cur brú ar 240 duine imeacht ón Stát gach aon lá. Tá 400,000 duine imithe sna cúig bliana anuas. Is géarchéim í an eisimirce éigeantach, agus go dtí seo theip ar Rialtais i ndiaidh a chéile dul i ngleic leis an fhadhb seo.

The current inequality of citizenship which punishes Irish citizens living outside the State must be ended. The Constitutional Convention took a significant step in the context of recognising equal rights for all Irish citizens by recommending voting rights in presidential elections for citizens living in the North and those Irish citizens living abroad.

They are set to continue to rise with a likely peak at approximately 596,000 pupils to be catered for in 2019. This compares with 526,000 pupils enrolled in primary schools in the last academic year. The Deputy rightly points out that the Dublin South-East area is among those areas where this increase is creating pressure for extra school places and this is being felt strongly in the short term. The Department has highlighted the Dublin South-East area as one that will need extra school places from 2014 onwards. The Deputy will be aware that my Department uses a geographical information system to identify where the pressure for school places will arise. The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection in addition to the Department's databases. The Department also uses data from local authorities. With this information the Department carried out a study of the country to identify where there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. The Dublin South-East area surfaced as one needing extra school places under the process. In June 2011, I announced the need for the establishment of 20 new primary schools with approximately 500 pupils per school to cater for increased demographics in several locations up to and including 2017. This included the establishment of a new school for the Dublin South-East area. The school, known as the Shellybanks Educate Together national school, which will open this coming September, will be located initially in start-up accommodation in Ballsbridge. It will cater for demand for pupil places from the Sandymount, Ringsend and Irishtown areas. It is planned that the new school will provide an additional 16 mainstream classrooms for the area when it is fully developed, or more if extra capacity is needed. The Department is working on acquiring permanent accommodation for the school but this alone is not enough and additional capacity is being provided in other schools in the area as well. A building project to facilitate the amalgamation and expansion of two schools is facilitated under the five year construction programme I announced in March 2012. The project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning and it will provide further classrooms for the Dublin South-East area when completed. The Department is also working closely with some of the other schools in the area to address enrolment issues in the shorter term, starting next September. These schools include Canon O'Hanlon memorial school, otherwise known as Star of the Sea school in Sandymount, St. Brigid's primary school on Haddington Road, and Scoil Mhuire Lakelands on Gilford Road. I record my thanks to the schools for their help and support in this matter. In tandem, the Department is examining the most up-to-date demographic data available for the area to determine further needs and ensure these are met in a timely manner. The Department and I will continue to monitor the situation to ensure every pupil seeking a place in the area can have access to one.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	I thank the Minister and I welcome his reply. He represents the same constituency as me and therefore is fully aware of all the issues involved. I welcome the reforms the Minister is bringing to the schools admission process. They have been received well in general in the constituency and in the country, as has the advanced schools buildings programme. However, the Minister will have received the same correspondence I have been getting from parents who are thinking about deferring sending their children to school to September 2014. Some have moved to baptise their children in a matter of weeks simply to try to get them moved up the lists. Others have had to go to family members to try to help with moving to pay for private education because they cannot get into a local State school. The Minister rightly identified some of the schools where there are problems, including St. Mary's national school on Belmont Avenue. Is there a possibility that we could have an extra classroom in the new Shellybanks Educate Together school for September 2014? Is there any possibility of using a site, for example, a site on Harcourt Terrace, that could be expanded on a temporary basis? Could property be leased? Furthermore, in terms of the possible solutions, to what extent are the schools and, through the school boards, the parents, being informed of all the efforts the Minister is making to try to resolve the situation? As each week moves on, parents become more frantic about it.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	I welcome the Deputy's comments and his recognition of what we are trying to do. Part of the problem is that the GIS registers the physical location of every child benefit payment for those aged one, two and three years of age. It works accurately and satisfactorily in certain areas, for example, outside a town like Clonakilty or Donegal town, where we have a fair idea what the growing population is and what the likelihood is of the numbers that will present in the nearest urban area. In a large urban area like Dublin, there are people who have moved to the suburbs. Some of these may have grown up in the inner city area and they may wish to bring their children back in to the city centre, which they are entitled to do, since the grandparents are providing support after school. Therefore, our ability to measure and capture the numbers of people looking for places in big urban areas, whether in Cork, Limerick, Galway or Dublin, is self-evidently less clear and less sophisticated than in different parts of the country where the growth in demand can only be accommodated in the area most likely to accommodate it and where people are unlikely to travel miles in another direction. Notwithstanding that, the increase in the numbers has, to a certain extent, caught us by surprise and we are considering emergency measures to get extra accommodation. Deputy Murphy has referred to some of these. We have had one setback in respect of the amalgamation of St. Brigid's and St. Mary's schools on Haddington Road. Planning permission and so on was secured in the normal way but then an appeal was lodged in the past working day, which is perfectly valid. People are perfectly entitled to so do. There are difficulties with traffic. We hope the appeals process can be expedited as quickly as possible. I thank the Deputy for bringing the matter to the attention of the House because it is an issue. I will communicate with him and other colleagues in the constituency.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	I thank the Minister of State for taking this topic. We will have the chance to discuss other issues in respect of housing tomorrow. One thing that has come across clearly to all Members is the fact that housing construction has fallen to critically low levels. Output is not keeping pace with the additional households that are formed every year. We are told there are 100,000 people on the housing waiting lists. However, the figures I have received for housing units provided last year indicate in the region of 8,000 were provided. Perhaps the Minister of State will confirm this. It is important that social housing should be increased in particular because of the increase in homelessness in the past two years. I hope the Government can assist the housing associations by resolving some of the existing hurdles and, in turn, deliver more social housing. I have in mind in particular availing of private finance with appropriate terms and conditions and removing the administrative hurdles that exist such as State mortgage charges. The NAMA model has been referred to frequently but I believe the NAMA model should be speeded up in respect of property transfers. I hope we could have at least a three year planned housing development programme. Many areas could be examined but I hope the Minister of State will consider the position of voluntary housing projects. I have a case which I raised before by way of a parliamentary question in respect of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul project at Ozanam House, Ballinasloe, County Galway, a proposed voluntary housing project for the elderly in Ballinasloe. The project is one of many that requires the Department's capital assistance scheme funding to proceed to the next stage. I understand that by 27 March, which is only 14 days away, local authorities must submit their prioritised lists of capital assistance projects. I hope the project in Ballinasloe will be considered in this allocation. Ballinasloe does not have any housing for the elderly. Let us compare this with a town such as Tuam where Clúid has a successful sheltered housing project, mostly for elderly people.Given the amount of work that has gone into the project by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, I hope this can be favourably considered. Many elderly people are feeling the effects of a combination of social welfare cutbacks and increased rents. This is particularly so in Dublin where due to those issues, more people are on waiting lists for social housing. Homelessness will continue if we do not tackle the issue. The Minister of State has said we will deal with homelessness once and for all by 2016, but a lot more work is needed now if we are to meet that target.

As Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I am keenly aware of the challenges we face in providing housing supports to a range of vulnerable people in County Galway and elsewhere. The Government's 2011 housing policy statement clearly outlines that the priority for the Government is to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. The Government is responding to these needs through a variety of mechanisms and more flexible funding models. To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the rental accommodation scheme each play their part. I am fully committed to capturing social housing gain from private developments. Alongside expanding the role of the approved housing bodies, AHBs, in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease. As Deputy Kitt said, a relatively small number of houses were built last year. He cited a figure of 8,000 which would not be far off the mark in terms of total housing construction. Increasing both public and private housing supply is a priority for the Government. Earlier today, I was pleased to announce the restart of a local authority mainstream house building programme. Over the next two years €68 million will be invested across the country to build new social homes for families in need of housing. This investment represents the first return to new mainstream local authority house building in a number of years. This initiative, which will see some 442 new homes built across the country for families on the waiting lists, is just one of a number of Government-backed initiatives we are launching in 2014, which will provide high-quality homes for families. I also intend to announce details of a special investment of €15 million for the retrofitting of boarded-up local authority houses to make these available to households in need of social housing. Not only will these programmes deliver new or better housing for people, they will also create and sustain hundreds of jobs in the construction and green energy sectors. I know that Deputy Kitt is familiar with the capital assistance scheme, CAS, whereby funding of up to 100% of the cost of projects is provided to approved housing bodies, through local authorities, for the provision of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need, including older persons, persons with a disability or homeless persons. Over the years, the CAS scheme has funded the provision of over 27,000 units of accommodation. I am committed to the retention of this worthwhile programme. In January, my Department requested local authorities to issue a call for proposals under the CAS scheme, requesting approved housing bodies to put forward cost-effective and sustainable proposals to meet the accommodation needs of people with specific categories of housing need within their administrative areas. Local authorities are required to submit a prioritised list of proposals to my Department by 28 March for new construction and acquisition projects to be funded and progressed over the next two years. It will be a matter for local authorities to determine the relative priority of projects on the basis of their contribution to meeting local housing need and to shortlist these in order of merit. Further consideration of CAS scheme projects for funding approval over the next two years, including projects submitted in County Galway, must await the receipt of submissions from local authorities. I therefore look forward to receiving the submissions by 28 March and we will then make decisions very quickly.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	372	I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I welcome her announcement concerning the next two years when €68 million will be invested across the country for the construction of new social homes for families in need of housing. The Minister of State referred to 442 new homes being built across the country for families on waiting lists. If it is true that 100,000 people are on the waiting list, however, that will only help a small number of families. Nonetheless, every new home is a help. I hope that, perhaps with the assistance of the Department of Finance, the Minister of State will get further funding to deal with a very long waiting list.  As I have already suggested, the Minister of State might examine what voluntary housing organisations are doing. She might try to assist them because they are determined to provide for real housing needs in County Galway, and I am sure the same applies in other counties. Many obstacles are being placed in the way of such organisations, however, so the Minister of State may hopefully be able to help out by providing them with more assistance. For example, people who get houses through voluntary associations should be able to purchase them under a tenant purchase scheme, which they could do if they were built through a local authority. The Minister of State did not deal with the question of NAMA. I would like to see the pace of NAMA property transfers being speeded up to ensure that whatever is available there could be provided. In addition, State land could be examined in this regard. NAMA has said it is willing to co-operate in speeding up the transfer of property. I would like the Minister of State to deal with those issues and hopefully tomorrow we will have another discussion on housing.

We will have an opportunity to address some of those issues tomorrow. I do hope that we will be able to get further funding. I welcome support from all sides of the House in getting as much funding as we can for housing construction because there is clearly a need for it. The transfer of NAMA units has been speeded up quite a bit. We expect that we will get the full 2,000 units in the lifetime of this Government, which is the commitment we have made. We meet with NAMA's representatives fairly regularly to address these issues. We now have a more simplified system for the transfer of NAMA units.  The Deputy referred to the private housing sector and getting private funding. Under the CAS scheme, only approximately 25% of funding comes from the State, while the voluntary sector raises extra funding. That scheme is progressing. We now have voluntary regulation of the private sector, which they tell us makes it easier for them to obtain funding in the private sector. We have some examples of where that is progressing. I am willing to examine all the various options that come forward. We expect to deliver about 5,000 units this year, some of which will be from direct construction, some from the CAS scheme, some through NAMA and others through leasing and the rental accommodation scheme. We are using as many different systems as we can because there is clearly a need for such housing.  Along with everybody in this Chamber, I would like to increase the construction of local authority housing. I am happy that today marks the restart of a mainstream programme after the collapse of the economy. I hope that we will be able to make further announcements in the near future. 
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	374	The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, may have seen the article on the front page of the Evening Echo yesterday, which was very worrying for any expectant mothers in the southern region. I do not propose to indulge in scare-mongering about a crisis or safety issues in our maternity hospitals. I tabled this Topical Issue matter to allow the Government to outline its plans in the wake of the recent report and to give some reassurance to expectant mothers. I wish to give the Government an opportunity to outline exactly what steps it will be taking. Having read yesterday's report, the Minister of State will know all the facts. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation estimates it will take about 550 posts to be filled to bring the 19 maternity hospitals up to the international best standard for the birth rate, which is one midwife to 29.5 births.The current national average ratio in the 19 hospitals stands at one midwife to 38 births while the figure in Cork University Maternity Hospital is one midwife to 37 births. The ratio ranges from one midwife to 30 births to one midwife to 55 births. This is a very worrying statistic as is the information that none of the 19 maternity hospitals is operating under what is known as the international best practice ratio of one midwife to 29.5 births. It is also worrying to consider that Liam Doran recently stated that even if all the posts were advertised in the morning, in his estimation it would take five to six years to fill all those posts with experienced registered midwives. The HSE has given a commitment to undertake a national examination as a result of the report on the 19 maternity hospitals. I ask the Minister of State to outline how the Government intends to reassure expectant mothers.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. As parents ourselves we are very conscious that delivering a baby is the most vulnerable time in any woman's life and the most anxious time for any family. I refer to recent incidents which took place in Portlaoise and we should also extend our sympathies to people who have lost much longed-for babies. We all feel that loss. With regard to the issue raised by the Deputy, I wish to make it clear that there is no embargo on the recruitment of midwives or other front-line staff in the public health service. While the numbers employed across the public health service must be reduced in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets, it is recognised that certain services such as maternity are demand-led and require specialist staffing. The HSE has arrangements in place to allow the recruitment of such staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement. I am satisfied that it is open to the HSE to recruit the levels of front-line staff necessary to ensure a safe service provision. More generally, in order to mitigate the impact on front-line services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost-efficient health system. At the end of 2013 the number of staff midwives, including senior staff grade in the public health service, was 1,341 whole-time equivalents, including 20 on the graduate placement scheme. At the end of 2007 the number was 933 whole-time equivalents. This shows how the HSE has the capacity to focus recruitment in specific areas where increases are required. The increase in nursing hours available under the Haddington Road agreement equates to nearly 1,400 additional nurses. The number of nursing staff increased by 100 in the first month of 2014, reflecting the take-up of posts under the graduate initiative. In the case of staffing levels at Cork University Maternity Hospital, I have been informed by the HSE that from a staff complement of 397 whole-time equivalents, currently 388 midwifery nurses are employed. I understand that active recruitment processes are in place to fill the nursing midwifery posts, including 7.5 gynaecological nursing posts and two assistant directors of midwifery. I draw the attention of Members to a midwifery workload and workforce review of maternity services in Ireland which will be undertaken by the HSE. This review will validate staffing levels for midwives and maternity care assistants in maternity units and will recommend appropriate midwifery staffing and skill mix levels and initiatives to meet emerging models of maternity care in order to ensure standards of safety and quality of care for women and their families. The workforce review will inform the new national maternity services strategy and as part of the development of the strategy, maternity services in all parts of the country will be subject to review and evaluation. The development of this strategy is under way and will determine the optimal configuration of maternity services to ensure that women in Ireland have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs. I intend to publish the strategy later this year. 
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I take the Minister of State at her word that there is no embargo on the recruitment of front-line staff in maternity hospitals in particular. If that is the case, I ask if she will enlighten us as to the reason for the log-jam. None of the 19 maternity hospitals has the best practice standard of the ratio of midwives to births, which is one midwife for 29.5 births. A total of 25 babies a day are being delivered in CUMH. According to a report in the local paper yesterday, it would take an additional 60 staff to bring the number of staff to the international standard ratio. Is a recruitment campaign currently under way to recruit an adequate number of midwives to provide the maternity hospitals with the best ratio? I presume the HSE report will investigate staffing levels and also take a holistic view of maternity services to include safety and best practice. If the report is to be published before the end of the year, I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that its recommendations will be implemented as quickly as possible if fiscal constraints permit. As the Minister of State said, having a baby is one of the most anxious times for women when they are most vulnerable. We must ensure that reassurance about resources or information can be provided to women who are pregnant and are patients in maternity hospitals and that all safety standards are being met at all times.

There is no embargo on recruitment of staff considered to be necessary to the provision of a safe service. This includes midwives. We are taking a holistic approach to maternity services. I wish to reassure people that apart from recent events, our maternity services are very safe. Not alone are they safe, but they give a degree of confidence to every mother who uses those services. We must learn from the recent events and ensure that they will never be repeated. The Department of Health now has a post of director of nursing who will undertake the survey in order to produce a strategy. The grouping of hospitals will ensure a safer delivery of care across a range of issues. The grouping of hospitals is central to services in the greater Cork area. We must learn from the awful events in the recent past which left mothers and families bereft to ensure that there will never be a repetition. That learning has begun already.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	378	Elverys Sports is a company that has been trading profitably, notwithstanding its being taken into the National Asset Management Agency, an achievement that is due to the hard work of management and staff over the years. It has grown from a single shop in Castlebar, County Mayo, to a chain of 54 stores nationwide, with a growing online business. As a result of NAMA's shenanigans in handling the sale of the business, however, this profitable company has gone into examinership. Is this how NAMA, the largest property company in the world, should be doing its business on behalf of the taxpayers of this country? As we know, NAMA issued a notice of decision to sell the company to a management buy-out team. Way past the 11th hour, however, it allowed that deal to be scuppered by entertaining a further bid, which resulted in the company being placed in examinership. What is the final cost of this examinership, not to mention the associated costs? Elverys Sports has been put into freefall on account of this uncertainty, which has adversely affected its ability to trade and will surely undermine the value of the company when it comes to sale. It is enough to make one's blood boil when one considers the number of jobs at stake. Certainly, it seems clear that job protection is not a significant concern for NAMA in this particular instance. I am disappointed that the Minister for Finance is not in the Chamber this evening, given his responsibility for NAMA and its activities. We are here today to press the case for safeguarding the 700 jobs that are at risk at Elverys Sports stores nationwide. The best way forward is clearly for a management buy-out to proceed. These people know best how the company works and have the wherewithal to forge ahead and ensure its growth as a leading Irish company. Every other day, I hear the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, his Cabinet colleagues, IDA Ireland and other Government agencies reminding us how difficult it is to get jobs into the west. Job creation is mainly taking place in the major centres of population, a fact that is recognised in the new regional focus included in the revised Action Plan for Jobs. What is the action plan to retain the nearly 200 jobs in Mayo that are in jeopardy? How is real meaning being given in this instance to the high priority NAMA is supposed to place on the preservation of jobs? Will the Minister offer some reassurance to the workers who are in the Chamber today and their fellow workers throughout the country?
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	379	This is a very serious matter for the 700 employees of Elverys Sports, their families and the communities in which they reside. The company's staff are local to its units throughout the country and the various stores are dedicated to and embedded in their communities, as witnessed by the sponsorship they offer to various clubs and organisations and their support for students in offering them summer and weekend work. As Deputy Mulherin outlined, Elverys Sports finds itself in examinership after a management buy-out was deemed not to be successful because there were other parties seeking to enter the fray. The examiner has an obligation to act in the interests of NAMA, as has been explained. However, NAMA, too, has an obligation to act in the interest of taxpayers. We in this House have our own obligations to the people who give us the privilege to be here. We also have an obligation to taxpayers to ensure that the funds provided to bodies like NAMA yield a dividend for the Exchequer. Any successful bid out of the six that are supposedly on the table must have at its core a commitment to staff interests. The best way to ensure that outcome is for the examiner to allow a staff representative to be privy to the assessment of the various bids. It is the responsibility of Government to ensure NAMA is cognisant of its social obligations as well as its economic responsibilities. It is also the responsibility of Government to ensure that debt not necessarily associated with a profitable business such as this is not allowed to drown jobs, communities and the retail sector, and thereby rid our towns of much-needed investment. This particular case is a test of the recent comments by Morgan Kelly in his analysis of the economy. It is time for the Government to show it will not stand idly and allow this or any other SME of its type be put to the sword by those who would seek to strangle it in the manner in which matters have been pursued in this instance.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	380	I received an e-mail last week from some of the Elverys Sports workers, as I assume did other Members. I was aware of reports in recent weeks that the company was going into examinership, with the likely outcome being a management buy-out. The general view among workers is that such an outcome would be best for them in terms of contracts, wages and conditions. In that context, it is absolutely amazing that we have arrived at a situation where the examiner has let other potential buyers into the fray. Will the Minister explain why this has happened and what is likely to happen next? Will he give an assurance that whatever the outcome, the 700 jobs in Elverys Sports stores throughout the country will be protected, together with the contracts and conditions of the workers? This is a long-established company which, as the other speakers mentioned, provides sponsorship for sporting organisations throughout the country. Indeed, it is a much better sponsor than the cigarette and alcohol companies. We should support these types of local businesses as much as possible. I am not sure whether it is in the Minister's power to intervene with NAMA and with the examinership process. In any event, he has an opportunity this evening to explain to the workers what is happening.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22276	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. As Minister with responsibility for employment, I am always concerned about any job losses. Indeed, job retention and creation has been my main focus since taking office. The company referred to by the Deputies is in the middle of the examinership process and, as such, it is important that nothing be said here this evening that might affect the outcome of that process. It will be for the examiner to consult creditors, potential investors and other relevant parties to devise the most appropriate course of action in the interests of the survival of the company and put that course of action to the court for approval. The court will have the final say and, until then, the company is under its protection. We must be careful to respect that. Examinership is the main debt restructuring system for companies in Ireland and has been in existence since 1990. It allows for the rescue of companies which find themselves insolvent but have the potential to return to financial viability and continue in operation into the future. The key feature of the process is a period of court protection lasting up to 100 days during which nobody may institute proceedings against the company or petition for it to be wound up. The examiner uses this time to devise a scheme of arrangement in consultation with creditors, company management, potential investors and any other parties that will be affected by the scheme. The scheme of arrangement is put to the court and if the majority of the company's creditors and the court approves, it becomes binding on all of them. In the case of Elverys Sports, I am informed that NAMA, in its role as a secured lender, approved the sale of assets of the parent company, Staunton Sports, to the management team following a process run by the directors of Staunton Sports through IBI Corporate Finance, acting under the duty of care to NAMA. However, the receivership event required to give effect to the transaction could not proceed at the agreed time because the management team did not have the requisite funding in place to complete. A higher bid was indicated by another party prior to the receiver's appointment and sale completion. The prospective receiver advised that, if appointed, he would be legally obliged to consider this bid, since he has a statutory obligation to secure the best price reasonably obtainable for the secured assets at the time of their sale. Several press outlets have carried news of the third-party bid. The resulting uncertainty caused concern among suppliers and trade creditors, a situation which the directors of Staunton Sports brought to the attention of NAMA. Having regard to the deteriorating condition of the business and the company's insolvent position, and based on legal advice, NAMA put to the directors of Staunton Sports that examinership was an alternative option which would permit all bids to be considered while the company was under the protection of the High Court. It is on the public record that the appointment of an examiner to Elverys Sports was supported by the directors of the company. The decision to seek the protection of the court through examinership was taken in order to protect the company and its employees, and NAMA is funding the company during the examinership process. It is understood that the examiner is currently in the process of engaging with various parties who have expressed an interest in the business, including the management team. As part of this process, the examiner has requested proposals from each of the parties regarding their plans for the business and for the employees of the company. The examiner has not yet concluded this process. I believe examinership is a good option for companies that have real prospects for the future, but find themselves in financial difficulty at present. I should say that the examiner in this instance has already gone to the court and made a presentation to the effect that this company has a prospect of viability. He has convinced the court of the prospect of viability and the court has provided for a 100-day extension. That is an important first step that has to be taken. The company has done that. The balanced procedure that has to be followed in these cases takes account of the interests of the ailing company and the rights of its creditors and gives the courts a role in ensuring there is a fair and appropriate outcome. Of course there have been some criticisms of the costs associated with the examinership process. For that reason, the Oireachtas passed the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 late last year. This legislation allows small private companies to apply for examinership in the Circuit Court, rather than having to go directly to the High Court. I hope this will make examinership an option for more companies in the future. In the meantime, I am keeping the law on examinership under review. I am keen to identify whether there are other ways of making examinership less costly. The specific issue of terms and conditions, which was raised by Deputy Joan Collins, is governed by the TUPE legislation. The TUPE obligations will apply in the event of the company being sold as a going concern. This means the current terms and conditions will continue to apply when the new owner is in place. I think I have responded to the other issues that were raised by Deputies.

#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	385	I understand the nature of examinership. With all due respect, NAMA took on a healthy and profitable company. The company got into the difficulties that required it to go into examinership on NAMA's watch. I think questions need to be asked about the way NAMA is doing its business. Companies that do not have problems are encountering problems when they come under the NAMA umbrella. That is the taxpayer's concern. These employees are concerned about their jobs. The Minister did not mention their jobs. I asked the Minister for Finance about the level of priority that NAMA gives to the retention of jobs when businesses are being sold as going concerns. He assured me in his response that NAMA gives a high priority to the preservation of jobs in any business that has a loan with the agency. There is no evidence of that here. It is crucial that the management buy-out should proceed. The company would not have gone into freefall if the notice of decision that was issued had been proceeded with at the time. Much of the blame for the fact that it has gone into freefall lies with NAMA. I believe it should be challenged. I am taking this up with the Minister for Finance. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is responsible for the issue of jobs. I understand he is working night and day to try to create jobs. In this instance, jobs are under threat in the west, where jobs are hard to come by. We need more action. The reality of the promise set out in the response I received from the Minister for Finance needs to come into play to protect the jobs of the Elverys Sports employees.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	386	I thank the Minister for his response. He said that the examiner is obliged to consult the relevant parties that are privy to this process. Does he agree that the level of consultation with the workers in this case has been minimal? Subsequently, and on foot of what has been said to Deputy Mulherin, does he believe and will he acknowledge to us that NAMA has a social obligation and responsibility to seek to pursue the retention of as many jobs as possible? Does he think NAMA is doing that in the proper fashion in this instance? He acknowledged that the directors agreed with NAMA's recommendation that the company should enter this process. Can he go a step further, following on from what he said about TUPE, and make it clear that the representatives and the staff should have a better engagement with and involvement in assessing the bids that will ultimately determine their future? Progress should be made in a way that meets the responsibilities to creditors and leads to a settlement with which they can be happy. If NAMA is the lead creditor, it must be obliged to respect the mandate it has from this House. In other words, NAMA has a social responsibility as well as an economic responsibility. Will the Minister reiterate for the House that these responsibilities must be applied in this instance to the full letter of the law? This is necessary if staff are to be sure that every effort is being made to give them the best possible opportunity to retain their jobs. As has been said previously, this company is in a profitable situation and cannot be allowed to be drowned as a result of being dragged down by loans that are not specifically related to the business. As I said earlier, this is the first indication the Minister can give on behalf of the Government that he will not stand idly in this instance or any future instances that relate to how banks deal with debt associated with small and medium-sized enterprises.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	387	It seems that a profitable company, with the backing of its directors, went to NAMA to discuss a management buy-out. It appears that as a result of difficulties experienced after that time, it was not possible for the company to exercise that buy-out. There is something wrong with that process, to my mind. Why would a profitable company not be able to complete such a buy-out? I want clarification in that regard. I asked about what will happen to the contracts, conditions and pay relating to these jobs, in the event of the company being bought, because I understand that the TUPE regime should protect these workers and their jobs regardless of who buys the company. It seems strange that a process which was started on foot of a positive development has led to the company now being in difficulty, and possibly being bought by somebody else.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22276	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	388	To be fair to NAMA, there is a bit of a misunderstanding of its role. NAMA was supportive of an arrangement that would have facilitated a management buy-out of a company that was insolvent. Implicit in that was an agreement to have some of the debts dealt with to allow the company to continue to proceed. As I understand it, it was not NAMA's fault that it was not possible for this process to be completed. After an alternative bid came in, NAMA suggested that the best way to protect the company was to seek an examinership process, which allows for a write-down of debt where creditors agree - this answers Deputy Cowen's point - and involves court protection to save the jobs, save the enterprise and try to maintain a going concern. NAMA's role in this process led to the testing of one option, which did not fulfil what was required. Now it has taken another approach as part of the search for a viable outcome. I certainly hope such an outcome can emerge from this approach. It is clear, in response to Deputy Cowen's point, that this process allows viable businesses to survive without their existence being threatened by bad property decisions or property debts that might be burdening them. That is what this process is about. The courts have a role. The purpose of examinership is to save the jobs. The TUPE regime will apply regardless of whether there is a management buy-out or one of the other bids is successful and the business continues. The transfer of obligations undertakings will apply in both cases. The legal security of the workers will be the same in both cases. I acknowledge the point that there might be a preference for one or the other. Reference was made to the examiner's role with regard to different players, including the creditors or the workers. Examiners are governed by very strict legislation that sets out what they can and cannot do. Essentially, they must try to find a scheme or arrangement that can be put to the creditors and allows for a viable outcome. I am sure they try to keep workers involved to the best extent possible during that process. They have a responsibility to the courts and the creditors. In this case there are six bids which, no doubt, have to be dealt with as six independent bids and handled confidentially. I imagine the examiner is under considerable legal constraint in the way he deals with this situation. This is the best way in which we can seek to save the jobs involved, which I sincerely hope is the outcome of this process. The examiner was appointed on 4 February and is still at a relatively early stage in the process. I do not have a role in the examinership. Obviously, the examiner must deal with those directly involved and report back to the court, with the outcome of the various options.

The HSE's Vote is moving into the Department of Health. It is extremely important that the financial measurement of what goes on in the health service and the delivery of the health needs of patients in all hospitals is done in a way that allows the activities of delivering the service to be costed. To date, it has been a bland form of budgeting with dollops of finance allocated to hospitals and so on. We have not had an activities measurement that can be applied consistently and uniformly across all units in the service. This would be extremely important in advance of the introduction of a universal health insurance system regardless of whether that system is to be a multi-insurance provider or a sole State provider. At this stage it would be important for the Government and its advisers to revisit the overall concept of universal health insurance to see where the shortcomings are in other systems such as the Dutch model and so on. The United States also has multi-insurance participation, supposedly to provide competition that would produce cost efficiencies. However, that can also lead to over-delivery and over-costing of that delivery into a system of profit-based delivery taking away from the essence which should be patient and needs focused. The framework for the accounting and financial measurement systems should be activities based. In other words those elements that go into delivering good health management at HSE locations should be properly set up on an integrated computer system to allow for budgeting, historical measurement and the comparison of activity-based accounting budgets with outcomes. It should be done in a way that makes sense and needs to be flexible enough to take account of different systems of delivery as they are developed.

I wish to speak on a report published last month, Health Care Quality Indicators in the Irish Health System, examining the potential of hospital discharge data. I believe the report has implications for the operation of this legislation and the interaction or lack of interaction between the HSE and the Department of Health. On 23 February, Mr. Ian Carter, national director of acute hospitals, in an interview with Ms Susan Mitchell of The
Sunday Business Post, was asked if the HSE had examined the reasons behind the high mortality rates in some units. He responded by saying "not yet". He said the HSE was only now validating the figures and examining whether there was a real variance or whether the differentials could be attributed to "poor coding" of data. He went on to say: "Have we had a systematic approach? No, we haven't in terms of drilling on down to individual hospitals. It has been slow, but the exercise is now happening on a hospital by hospital basis." His defence was that the report had only "just been published". This is an outrageous admission by a senior official within the Health Service Executive because this report was available to the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and the HSE some 30 months prior to that when the Minister came into the House and read part of the report into the record and on foot of that used it as a validation for his decision to close the emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital. Following the publication of the report last month, the Chief Medical Officer described it as a burglar alarm. He said that while he was not saying the house was ransacked, it clearly needed to be checked out. While the Department of Health informed the HSE to check the alarm, both organisations continued to let that alarm ring for 30 months before opening the door of the house to see what was happening inside. Mr. Ian Carter said that the review was only now happening, 30 months after the information was compiled.What is even more bizarre is that in March 2012, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, told this House the reason the report had not been published two years ago. He stated:...the CMO, in conjunction with the HSE, is now in the process of further augmenting the analysis of the indicators to date with data from 2011 and 2012. Every public hospital in the country has been written to in order that they can ensure that the information they record and report for 2011 and 2012 is actually accurate.These figures were setting off alarm bells in the Department of Health in July 2011 as per the comments of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in the House during the debate on Roscommon hospital. Even after the follow-up with the hospitals, which clarified the figure in regard to Roscommon, in respect of those hospitals that were outside the norm where stroke death rates were four times higher than some of the others and the heart attack death rates were seven times higher than the best performers, amazingly, nothing was done to determine the basis of those mortality rates for 30 months. The Minister was happy to see that report lying on a shelf because he had fulfilled his short-term agenda. Rather than delving into the figures, which could have exposed weaknesses both within the Health Service Executive, HSE, and within the Department of Health that may have raised difficult questions to be answered by him politically and for his Department, the report was quietly set aside. We are told further analysis was carried out but the fact remains that the HSE is only now looking at those figures, and the Department of Health failed singularly to act upon that and ensure that the HSE had followed through on it. One of two things has happened. Either the report does not give rise to the patient concerns, which means the report is a work of fiction, or it is reflecting a problem at hospital level that has been sat on for 30 months. One way or the other, both the Department of Health and the HSE need to come into this House and explain exactly which is the case.  This revelation again raises serious concerns about the Minister, Deputy Reilly, the Department of Health and the HSE. Their failure to act on the original data and on the revised data is putting the interests of patients behind the institutional interests of the HSE and the Department of Health. That sounds very familiar in regard to what we heard in recent weeks about Portlaoise hospital where local management failed to act. As a result, the Minister has brought in the Coombe hospital in Dublin to supervise what is going on in Portlaoise but in this instance the senior management within the HSE, the Chief Medical Officer within the Department of Health and the Minister had that report for 30 months and failed to act on it and failed to ask questions as to why those stroke and heart attack death rates were so high. The people of this country and the patients admitted to those hospitals need and deserve an explanation, and we need an explanation as to the reason those senior people with responsibility for the health service failed to follow though on damning data they got 30 months ago.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	396	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill before the House. One could say it is another health Bill and another speech from the Minister on what he intends to do but after three years he has done nothing to improve the health services to the general public. We still have overcrowding, patients on trolleys, a lack of nursing staff and a reduction in the number of medical cards available to people, yet the Minister would ask Members on all sides of the House to support this Bill. We believe in a strong public health system but this Bill, which is part of a process to abolish the HSE, undermines the public health service. It effectively transfers the HSE budget back to the Minister. If we had a capable Minister we would not be concerned about that but to transfer the budget to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is putting politics back into the health services. The legislation provides for the funding of the HSE and its successor through the Vote of the Minister for Health from 1 January 2015. The HSE Vote will be abolished and a new financial governance structure will be introduced. The Minister has not yet explained or outlined that new governance structure to the House. It follows on from the enactment of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill in July under which the HSE board was abolished and replaced by a directorate. Judging by the budget presented to the House in December, the directorate did not bring about any great improvements on the funding or the way the quality of care was to be administered to the public. The Government says its legislation will enable new funding arrangements to be put in place as part of the wider restructuring of the health service and the ultimate implementation of universal health insurance. For a number of years before he came into office, the Minister talked about the Dutch model. He is not talking about any model now because the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, have rubbished the Minister's intention to introduce universal health insurance. We are still waiting on the White Paper, and we are still waiting to know what it will cost per patient. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform signalled recently that it could be an exorbitant charge of up to €1,600 or €1,700 per annum, which would be outside the remit of the ordinary person in this country. The Minister should bring forward the White Paper as quickly as possible. He needs to explain what he intends to do regarding universal health insurance and whether it is dead in the water, so to speak, because that seems to be the position in terms of what is coming out of the Department of Finance and the office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in recent weeks. The Minister has done a good deal of talking about the improvements in the health services but in my county we still have people on trolleys, a lack of nursing staff, young people waiting between 18 months and three years for speech therapy, overcrowding, a reduction in the grants available for the elderly, a reduction in the amount of money available for respite grants, and serious reductions in other areas. Recently, the Minister implemented the hospital groupings designed to deliver improved outcomes for patients. Under the old HSE system, Wexford and the south east were amalgamated under Carlow-Kilkenny and Wexford-Waterford, and Cork was the main hospital service in the south east. Wexford has been transferred now to what is known as Dublin East in which there is a large number of hospitals including St. Vincent's University Hospital, the Midland Regional Hospital, St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny, our own hospital in Wexford, St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, and Cappagh hospital. A number of other hospitals have been mentioned that will now cater for Dublin East. I do not know whether that will improve the quality of services because I am aware that on a daily basis people were finding it very difficult to get into hospitals such as St. Vincent's before we ever came under this new grouping. There will, therefore, be serious problems in the ability of Dublin hospitals to provide for a large area of the population in the south east. Wexford has a population of 140,000 and when we consider that Carlow, Kilkenny and other areas will feed into the hospitals in Dublin, it will put major pressure on the hospitals in Dublin to provide services in an adequate way.The Minister needs to spell out what the new legislation will mean in terms of money because the HSE certainly spelled out very clearly in its 2014 service plan that there would not be adequate money to meet the needs of the public. What one might call the south-east service plan was presented to local Oireachtas Members last Monday week at Wexford hospital, where we were told the hospital's budget was to be reduced by €3 million for 2014. This hospital got kudos in 2013 for being one of the most efficient hospitals in the country but, as a result, we now find its budget has been reduced. One would expect that if a hospital was in the top ten of efficient hospitals in the country, it would be rewarded, not penalised. Unfortunately, however, that is what has happened. We find ourselves €3 million down for 2014 and we are also told there will be no increase in funding for home help during 2014, despite the fact that the Minister points out regularly that we are an ageing nation and that there will be huge demand for services for older people. Extra home help would mean fewer people staying in hospital for longer and would enable them to return to live in their own homes. That has not happened and it certainly will not happen given what the Minister is suggesting for the future. The old HSE, which the Minister is now abolishing under this legislation, is only eight years old. Its thousands of workers delivered a very good care service in every community and provided a wide range of facilities. It was only really beginning to bed in under the old system but the Minister has now decided we are going to have a new system, one he will be in control of. This is bringing in politics. We see regulators being appointed in every other area to take powers and decision making away from Ministers, but here, under this legislation, the Minister is taking all powers back to himself. He is going to have a major input into the political running of the health service while he is in power, whether that is one year, two years or longer. The Minister is becoming the godfather of the health service. He is going to make all of the decisions. He is going to call in the HSE, as he did in December last year, and say that, politically, this or that is not a good idea and that he is going to make sure the HSE changes it. In the area of responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, I would like to remind her that, in Wexford, St. Senan's psychiatric hospital was closed and the people bought into A Vision for Change. We got some new buildings on the grounds of St. John's hospital and we were promised further new buildings and services for people suffering from mental health difficulties. I remind the Minister of State that she promised a significant number of extra staff, particularly for Wexford and the south-east region, because of the way the staff of St. Senan's and the Waterford psychiatric hospital implemented A Vision for Change. I would ask the Minister of State to ensure the extra nurses and staff who were promised are made available as quickly as possible. I know some of them have come on stream, which we appreciate, but we need further nursing facilities in that area. I was told recently that when the HSE visited Wexford to announce the service plan for 2014, it denied what is happening, namely, staff who had been in the field providing services on an outreach basis have been brought back into the mental health houses because of lack of staff in that area. That is a pity because the nursing staff out in the field have been providing an excellent service for those who suffer from mental health problems. They do not need to be in institutions. They are living at home and to have the nurse call is a very important part of keeping patients at home in a family and community environment. I ask the Minister of State to ensure there will be adequate nursing staff out in the field to provide these services.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	397	Faced with, on the one hand, the repeated mantras from the Government about reform, the legislation supposedly enacting that reform and the promises about the transformation of the health service, including universal health insurance and free GP care, and faced then, on the other, with the disaster of what is happening on a day-to-day basis within the health services, the overwhelming sense we get is of the band playing to distract people on the Titanic while the ship is sinking. It is a case of shifting around the deckchairs, trying to distract attention but, in reality, the ship of the health service is sinking beneath the waves, with the users of that service sinking with it. I do not think that is an exaggeration. The evidence is piling up day in, day out, week in, week out, of how serious the crisis now is in the public health service. We have chronically long waiting lists for people needing important operations. We have an ongoing trolley crisis; every day of every week hundreds of people are on trolleys in accident and emergency units across the country. We have constant reports of resource shortages and staff shortages in hospitals throughout the country. We have the absolutely shocking situation of dramatically high mortality rates in Portlaoise as well as the situation in Roscommon referred to by Deputy Naughten. We have leading consultants in hospitals in Dublin saying that the hospitals are now unsafe. We have doctors in the accident and emergency unit in St. Vincent's hospital confirming what some of us said, namely, that the downgrading of accident and emergency services in smaller hospitals like Loughlinstown was leading to a crisis in the so-called centres of excellence that would endanger the lives and health of patients. We have medical cards being taken away from chronically sick people. We have respite services being removed from families with disabled family members. We have disability services being cut back. Everywhere, the health service is under attack and falling apart, and patient safety and patient health are being threatened. We have all of this and, yet, surreally, side by side with that, we have these promises of wondrous reform and transformation in the health service, and the utopia which we can look forward to of universal health insurance and free GP care. Really, at this stage, these promises of reform and of universal health insurance have no credibility whatsoever. Frankly, if the Titanic of the public health system is sinking beneath the waves, there is just beneath the surface of those waves something else that maybe explains what is really going on, and that is the sort of stealth submarine of privatisation lurking beneath the surface, ready to take advantage of the crisis that is being engineered in the public health service. It is only in that context that one can understand the mess and the confusion that surrounds all of the talk of universal health insurance, but with no tangible reality to those promises, and understand that the real agenda is privatisation. Of course, it is set out in the brief for the Bill that all of this - these restructurings and changes in governance, in funding and in the Votes of the HSE and the Department of Health - is linked to the plan for universal health insurance.We must be honest with people and the truth is beginning to emerge. Universal health insurance is another name for compulsory private insurance forcing yet another tax on people to pay for services they have already paid for through their taxes. The figures that are beginning to emerge show that what many ordinary people will be looking at is a new tax of €1,600, €1,700 or €1,800 per year to line the pockets of private health insurance companies. This is really what is going on.  We have just heard criticism from Fianna Fáil that what is at stake in this Bill is the politicisation of the health service as against the wondrous model of the HSE. That is obviously nonsense and the Government would certainly have a point if it said something needs to be done about the HSE. If Fianna Fáil asked questions about the health service and what is going on in it and the Minister said that this is the HSE's responsibility, Fianna Fáil would be the first to jump up and down and say the Minister should take responsibility. I do think the Minister should take responsibility but the problem is that the abolition of the HSE that is being proposed and engineered is not to remove bureaucracy and inefficiency. Rather, it is to replace one form of bureaucracy, inefficiency and waste and a failed model for delivering health services with another model that will inevitably produce bureaucracy, inefficiency and waste and prevent the resources getting to the front line in the form of resources for hospitals and health services, staff and beds - all the things that actually make a health service function. We will just move from the bureaucracy of the HSE to the bureaucracy of the private health insurance companies and providers competing with one another to make money out of the crisis of the health service.  I do not understand why on earth the Government would want to move towards this. In particular, I do not understand why the Labour Party would go along with it. I do understand Fine Gael's often repeated and fairly openly stated belief that one must marketise things and bring market forces, competition and the for-profit economy to bear on just about every aspect of human activity and endeavour and the provision of services. That is what it believes and has always believed. It is implementing that belief with gusto everywhere it can but what I cannot understand is why the Labour Party is going along with this when we know where it leads and when we know that all it can possibly do is line the pockets of private health insurance companies and load up the costs of accessing health care for ordinary citizens. The evidence is everywhere. Anywhere one has these sorts of models, be it the Netherlands or the US, when one effectively hands over health services to private health insurance companies under whatever model one cares to construct, they suck up enormous amounts of resources in the form of profit, administration and billing - all the things that do nothing whatsoever to deliver health care to people. The US, which has the most developed version of universal health insurance model, spends more on health services than anywhere else in the civilised world but its health service is a mess because 40% of what is spent in the health service goes into the pockets of the private health insurance companies and providers. It means big salaries for the executives, lots of money for consultants and huge amounts of money soaked up by advertising and billing - all the things that inevitably follow if one brings market principles to bear on the provision of a vital public service. That is a disaster waiting to happen. It will clearly benefit those private health insurance providers but it will do nothing to improve the quality of health services delivered or access to those. It will not remove the two-tier system as we know because whatever basic basket of services are provided, those with money can then top up if they can afford it to access the other services that would be needed. Alternatively, one just has to jack up the overall cost for everybody or introduce charges for everybody, even those who cannot afford it. That is inevitably where this leads. Why does the Government remain committed to this model when there is no example of it working and delivering efficient health services to everybody who needs them?  Of course, there is a model we could look to, which is the model of a national health service. Is it not obvious that if one funds a health service directly from the taxes of people on a progressive basis according to ability to pay and this money goes into providing a health service that is available to everybody, and one does not have the middle man of private health insurance companies and all the bureaucracy, administration and profiteering that inevitably goes with that, one will have a better health service and that a higher proportion of the resources that go in will go to providing the actual health services that we are trying to deliver? Of course, the National Health Service in Great Britain in the post-war period was the example of that, such that even Conservative governments have not been able, despite their best efforts, to undermine the principle of a national health service. They have tried to chip away and introduce stealth privatisation but even the most conservative and middle-of-the-road people have held the line and said they want to defend the principle of a national health service because health is too important to be left to the market. There are certain things that must be provided for everybody because they need them and health is a such a service. I simply do not understand why the Labour Party turns its face from that model and goes along with the Fine Gael plan to carve up the health service for profit. I hope that, at some stage, the Government will tell us how all this is going to work because any serious scrutiny of it will make it clear that it cannot work. The Government never answers that question, namely, how it can justify the middle man of the private health insurance companies and providers creaming off profit from the provision of health services. How could that possibly be more efficient? It cannot be. In reality, it is undermining health services generally and the public health service and helping to create the crisis we now face.  What we need to do is provide the front-line services, staff, resources and beds. That is how one removes bureaucracy. It might seem like a philosophical point but it is one that is obvious if one thinks about it. Where does bureaucracy come from? Why does one get a bureaucracy? The answer is that one gets a bureaucracy if there is a shortage of resources and one must ration those resources. One then needs loads of bureaucrats to ration them. If one does not have a shortage of resources, one does not need a massive bureaucracy to ration out scarce resources. They are just provided by right because people need them. That is the problem with all of this restructuring of funding and governance models, moving from one failed model of organising the health service to another and now proposing another one that will not work either.This is literally just a case of shifting around the deck chairs on the Titanic in an attempt to solve bureaucratically a problem that is fundamentally one of resources. If 6,000 staff, 2,500 beds and €3 billion are cut from the health service and the Government plans to cut a further 7,000 staff and €1 billion this year, there will be a crisis in the service. It is obvious. The only beneficiaries will be private health insurance companies. The people who rely on the public health service will be endangered, as they are now, and there will be more unnecessary suffering for the service's users and stress for its staff. There will be further disasters and scandals like those we have seen in Portlaoise and so on. It is inevitable. I do not know whether the Government will just keep trundling along with this endless and fairly meaningless stream of supposed reform Bills and pie in the sky promises of what will be delivered in seven or eight years' time when what it needs to do now is provide resources and do away with the plan to privatise health services and carve up a vital human service to benefit private, for-profit corporations.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle as well as all the Deputies who contributed to this debate. As the Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated at the outset, the Bill is part of the wider health reform programme undertaken by the Government since taking office. The ultimate aim of the reform programme is a single-tier health service supported by universal health insurance in which access to services is based on need, not income. Deputies Breen, Kyne, Fitzpatrick and John Paul Phelan reiterated that point in their contributions. The Bill will bring the Vote of the HSE, which was established under the Health Act 2004, into the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health. It builds on the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act, which was passed by the Oireachtas last year and designed to improve the HSE's level of accountability. It is not, as Deputy Kelleher claimed, an effort to transfer power to the Minister. Rather, it is designed to increase the HSE's level of financial accountability to the Department and the Minister, a point acknowledged by Deputy Seán Kenny. Regarding Deputy Kelleher's specific criticism of sections 33A and 33B as inserted by section 11, section 33A is a standard provision in legislation for all State bodies funded through Departments. Its purpose is to enable the Minister of the day to give grants legally from the Vote as approved by the Oireachtas. Without it, there would be no legal basis for issuing funds. Section 33B is designed to put the existing procedures for approving capital plans on a statutory basis. This process was in place under the previous Government. Therefore, it is incorrect and misleading to portray these sections as a power grab. I also reject Deputy Shortall's assertion that proper corporate governance has been thrown out the window and that all power and responsibility are vested in the Minister. The checks and balances in respect of the operation of the HSE contained in the 2004 Act remain in place. Under that Act, it is a matter for the executive to draw up a service plan for the approval of the Minister. It is through this plan that resources are allocated for different services and areas. While the executive must rightly have regard to the policies of the Government in drawing up the plan, nothing in this Bill nor the governance legislation gives unfettered powers to the Minister. A number of Deputies raised a range of other issues. While I cannot answer each point, I wish to respond to the main ones. As the Minister has indicated, the Bill forms part of the Government's strategy to reform the health service with the objective of introducing a single-tier health system in which services will be provided to citizens based on need rather than ability to pay. This will be achieved through the establishment of universal health insurance, on which Deputy Pringle and others called for a debate. The Cabinet held an initial discussion on the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance last week. The issue will return to the Cabinet in the coming weeks with a view to publication quickly thereafter. Following its publication, there will be extensive public consultation, including on the services to be provided for each citizen within the standard package or basket of services. This will facilitate the debate on the universal health insurance proposals and I am confident that the matter will be fully discussed in the House. Deputy Kelleher made a number of claims regarding the effect of Government policies on the private health insurance market. The latest figures from the Health Insurance Authority show that there are now just over 2 million people, or 44.6% of the population, who have private health insurance. While this has fallen from a peak of 50.9% in 2008, Ireland continues to retain a high level of population holding voluntary private health insurance. A number of measures are being undertaken by the Department to help maintain a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market. The immediate focus is to keep health insurance affordable for as many people as possible. As part of the work to keep costs down, the Minister appointed an independent chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin, to work with health insurers, the Department of Health and the Health Insurance Authority on the issue. Mr. McLoughlin's report under phase 1 of the review process was published on 26 December 2013. The second phase of the review has commenced and will report within three months. In particular, it will further examine the factors behind rising costs in the private health insurance industry and seek to address them. Claims were made that the introduction of charges for private patients in public beds from 1 January could seriously undermine the market. The Government strongly believes that this new charge makes sense in terms of trying to end the significant State subsidy of private patients that insurers have enjoyed to date. Despite claims by some that the charges would cost insurers up to €120 million, they are actually designed to raise €30 million. Therefore, there is no basis for claims that this measure will damage the private health insurance market. I strongly reject Deputy Kelleher's argument that primary care has been undermined through policy and expenditure decisions. The implementation of the primary care strategy is a priority for the Government. It is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health system. This includes the development of primary care teams and primary care centres. The core objective is to achieve a more balanced health service by ensuring that the vast majority of patients and clients who require urgent or planned care are managed within primary and community-based settings. This will be achieved by increasing activity in the primary care setting and redirecting services away from acute hospitals to the community. Some 34 primary care centres have been opened since May 2011. In 2013, primary care funding of €20 million was allocated to support the recruitment of 264.5 additional primary care posts to enhance the capacity of front-line primary care teams. These additional posts include public health nurses, registered general nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists. More than 190 of these posts have now been filled or start dates have been agreed and a further 50 posts are in the final stages of recruitment. The HSE is committed to filling the remainder as soon as possible. The number of general practitioners, GPs, contracted to provide services under the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme has also increased in recent years. Some 2,413 GPs were contracted to provide services at the end of December 2013. This compares with 2,098 at the end of 2008, representing a steady increase in the number of contract holders of 15% or 315 posts.The cumulative effect of the reduction in GP fees and allowances under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act yielded some €123 million from 2009 to 2013. However, the impact of these reductions has been greatly mitigated by the ongoing increase in the number of medical card and GP visit card patients. This has fed through in GMS fees and allowances paid to GPs over the last number of years. These totalled approximately €453 million in 2013, €457 million in 2012, €438 million in 2011 and €460 million in 2010. As part of the development of primary care we are also introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees. As announced in budget 2014, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged five and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half the population will have access to GP services without fees. The Government is providing additional funding of €37 million to meet the cost of this measure. Some Deputies have criticised this plan and alleged a lack of engagement with GPs on the matter. The initiative is the first phase of the roll-out of a universal GP service. Measures are already in place to ensure that the majority of patients aged 70 years and over as well as individuals experiencing financial hardship as a result of medical expenses can access a GP service without fees pending the introduction of a universal GP service. Deputy Shortall asserted there was a better way to roll out free GP care and, in particular, that free GP care should first be rolled out to those with chronic illnesses. The Deputy knows that when the issue was examined in the Department, it became clear that complex primary legislation would be required to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of a particular illness. The assessment system involved would have to be robust, objective and auditable. Legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness and who would make the certification and provide for the selection of the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to the approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation followed by the preparation of statutory instruments. This would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to a universal GP service for the entire population. It makes more sense to pursue the policy in the current manner. On engagement with GPs, on 31 January last the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Alex White, launched a consultation process on the content and scope of a new contract for the provision of GP care, free at the point of use, for all children of five years of age and under. This is the first public consultation of its kind. The Minister of State met on the same day with representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Medical Organisation and the National Association of General Practitioners. The closing date for written submissions on the draft contract was 21 February 2014. The intention is to meet with GP organisations again in the coming weeks for detailed discussions on the scope and content of the draft contract. This will afford them the fullest opportunity to raise any and all issues which they may have regarding the draft contract and, indeed, to make their own proposals as to how it may be improved. To say that cards can no longer be awarded on a discretionary basis is completely untrue. Such spurious and unfounded comments only serve to cause concern and distress to members of the public. Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis where applicants cannot arrange general practitioner, medical and-or surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue financial hardship. To be very clear, there has been no change to this provision. Furthermore, there is no targeting of medical cards awarded on a discretionary basis. The contention that there has been a major policy change in the awarding of medical cards on a discretionary basis could not be further from the truth. While numbers may have fallen, this can be attributed, in part, to people who were marginally over the normal qualifying limit becoming eligible for medical cards under the normal qualifying scales. Discretion is not a stand­alone exercise but has been and remains an integral part of the assessment process for a medical card. Deputy Billy Kelleher referred to the statement of my colleague, Deputy Alex White, to the effect that there is no such entity as a discretionary medical card. What Deputy White said is true. There is only one medical card. Medical cards provided on the basis of means or where discretion is involved are identical and provide access to the same set of health services. A number of Deputies, including Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, referred to expenditure on health services. We must acknowledge that despite the significant progress made by the Government in respect of the public finances, resources are still scarce. Despite unavoidable resource reductions, however, successive HSE national service plans have managed to a significant extent to maintain core services. This has been achieved in tandem with supporting growing demand for services arising from population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, increased demand for drugs, higher numbers of medical card holders - up by 590,000 since 2008 - and new costly medical technologies and treatments. The HSE's 2014 national service plan has again sought to minimise the impact of constrained financial resources on front line services while maintaining patient safety in line with the Minister's stated overriding priority for 2014. I express my personal appreciation to HSE staff for their ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the delivery of quality health and social care services to the general public during particularly challenging times, a point acknowledged by Deputies Bernard Durkan and Frank Feighan in their contributions. This year, savings of over €600 million have been targeted. The targeted reduction in the cost of primary care schemes is €294 million, in pay related savings, including the establishment of a nurse bank, €280 million and in increased generation of private income in public hospitals, €30 million. This year may be the most challenging so far. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that the bulk of the required savings measures, including the €280 million in pay and related savings and €172 million worth of reductions in pharmaceutical prices and expenditures and general practitioner fees, will not impact on the general public. The cost of drugs was raised by a number of Deputies. There has been a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines. Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 empowers the HSE to set reference prices for medicines which the Irish Medicines Board has designated as interchangeable. The HSE implemented the first reference prices for products on 1 November 2013. Deputy Joan Collins raised a number of issues, including the needs of older people and, in particular, a recent report published by the private nursing homes association, Nursing Homes Ireland, which sought additional resources for the nursing homes sector. Deputy John Browne also raised issues relating to our older generation. The Government is acutely aware of future demographic trends and their implications for the provision of services for our older citizens. We have put in place a range of measures to support these services. The nursing homes support scheme review, which will be published in the coming months, will contribute to this process. While there will always be a need for long-term residential care, Government policy is to allow older people to stay in their own homes for as long as possible, as most prefer to do. Accordingly, provision for community and home-based services is being strengthened in 2014 to allow more people to stay in their own homes for longer. This will continue into the future. The national positive ageing strategy provides the blueprint for a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to planning for an ageing society. The strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four national goals and underpinning objectives to provide direction on the issues which must be addressed to promote positive ageing.An implementation plan to be finalised shortly will be overseen by the Cabinet committee on social policy. Although his speech did not relate to the Bill, it is important to respond to remarks made by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan about mental health services in Galway and Roscommon. The Health Service Executive is implementing the strategy for reforming the mental health services based on the report, A Vision for Change. This report recommended 50 acute general adult mental health beds for a population of 300,000. In Galway and Roscommon, a total of 79 beds currently serve a population of approximately 315,000. The overall stock of beds in HSE west is, therefore, too high in relative terms and this is allied to a corresponding underdevelopment of community based mental health services. To address this issue, a purpose built acute mental health unit will be completed in Galway University Hospital in 2015. The new unit will include 35 acute beds for general adult mental health services. The acute unit in Roscommon will continue to provide 22 general adult mental health beds. While St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, is reducing the number of general mental health beds on a phased basis, it will continue to deliver a range of services, including a 16 bed psychiatry of later life unit, a community service for mental health of older people and a day hospital for mental health of older people. The decisions on the changes in the Galway and Roscommon service were made by an expert group established by the HSE to examine this project and were reached on an objective basis that followed the approach adopted for comparable initiatives elsewhere. A major investment has been made to improve mental health services across Galway and Roscommon, providing an additional 44 permanent posts at a cost of €2.6 million. The majority of these positions have already been filled to instigate overdue change. A key objective of this service initiative is to balance genuine local concerns on change and patient care, as has been achieved where similar initiatives have been implemented elsewhere. I welcome the support Deputies Terence Flanagan and Finian McGrath expressed for the Bill. Both Deputies raised the issue of the recent controversy over top-up payments and suggested the matter should be addressed in this Bill. This legislation is designed for a specific purpose, namely, dealing with the Vote. In any event, the Health Service Executive has sufficient powers under existing legislation to address the problem the Deputies cited. It is not necessary, therefore, to introduce additional legislation to enable the HSE to deal with the matter. In addition, a new assurance process has been introduced, which will greatly strengthen the HSE's governance arrangements with the voluntary bodies concerned. Deputy Terence Flanagan was highly critical of the management of medical card applications by the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, citing as an example the experience of one of his constituents. While I cannot comment on individual cases, it should be acknowledged that the PCRS has made considerable efforts to improve its customer service. Last year, it assessed more than 700,000 individuals. It has set a target of processing medical card applications within 15 working days and has achieved a 95% success rate in meeting this target. Deputy Áine Collins raised the financial management of the Health Service Executive. The Government recognises the critical importance of the financial management of the health services. The successful implementation of the health reform agenda will require fundamental changes in the way financial management is delivered across the health system. Phase 1 of the financial reform programme has been completed and a new financial operating model agreed, as set out in the report entitled, Defining Financial Management: A Finance Operating Model for Health in Ireland, which is published on the HSE's website. This report encompasses a roadmap for the finance function to facilitate delivery of an efficient and effective financial service to meet the emerging requirements of the changing organisational face of the health system. A critical enabler for the transformation of financial management is the introduction of a single integrated financial management system. Phase 2 of the financial reform programme has commenced. The approach being adopted is very much of a collaborative and partnership nature, with a joint team comprising HSE staff and external consultants working together to deliver the requirements for a new system, in particular the development of a business case to obtain the necessary approval for a new integrated financial management system. Deputy Dan Neville referred to the use of funding for new developments in the mental health services. As the Deputy correctly noted, recruitment to the new posts for mental health services was phased in over the years 2012 and 2013. However, 366 new staff from the 2012 allocated posts and another 135 staff from the 2013 allocated posts had already started work by the end of last year. The remainder of the increase in the number of staff, which is to be funded from the additional allocation for mental health services, will continue to be recruited. The planned completion date for filling the 2012 and 2013 allocated posts is the end of the second quarter of this year. A cumulative sum of €70 million allocated over the past two years is available in 2014 to fund all the posts to be recruited from the 2012 and 2013 investment, with an additional €20 million allocated in 2014 to fund between 250 and 280 additional new posts. Deputy Simon Harris raised a number of issues specifically related to funding for people with disabilities and St. Vincent's University Hospital. The Deputy stressed the need for a transition to greater choice and control by people with disabilities over the services and supports they receive. I share his strongly held views on this matter and assure him that the value for money and policy review of disability services, which was approved by the Government in July 2012, sets out to do precisely as he wishes. The review sets out a radical and complex transformation to the manner in which services for people with disabilities are currently funded and delivered. This change will place individuals at the centre of service provision and deliver greater accountability and transparency in respect of the use of the substantial funds the Government allocates to the disability sector each year. The review is a multi-annual and multifaceted project and the Department and HSE are working in a structured way on a number of fronts to bring it about. The move away from block funding will result in a complete transformation in the way in which we deliver and fund services and will require a great deal of planning and testing before we decide exactly how it will operate in the Irish context. In respect of Deputy Harris's points on St. Vincent's University Hospital, he will be aware that the issue regarding the mortgage taken out by the hospital group was dealt with in a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Health Service Executive has taken measures to protect the State's interests in the public hospital. With regard to the employment arrangements for consultants, as recently as last month, the HSE indicated to the Department that there are no special employment arrangements in place for consultants employed by St. Vincent's University Hospital or St. Michael's Hospital, the two public hospital components of the St. Vincent's Hospital Group. Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the regulation of consultant posts in the public health system. As part of the delivery of this regulatory function, the HSE determines the location, contract type, hours, qualifications and other aspects of each consultant post. The HSE has not sanctioned any special employment arrangement for consultant posts under St. Vincent's University Hospital.  I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate. I emphasise again that the Government is committed to the health reform programme set out in the programme for Government. The Bill will implement one of the commitments contained in the programme. While it is largely technical in nature, this legislation is part of the process of reform which is designed to give people the health service they deserve, namely, a single tier service in which they will have access to services based on need rather than ability to pay, one which will be fair and in which all those treated will feel safe and all those working in it will be proud of the part they play. I commend the Bill to the House.

This means there are 9,000 fewer staff in our local authorities. However, the demand for local authority services has not decreased. Demand for essential local services is probably greater now than ever before. This Government's response to the lack of council staff to deliver those services as a result of the public service recruitment embargo is to encourage local authorities to engage in exploitative social welfare schemes such as JobBridge to replace almost 1,000 properly paid employees. They are now being further encouraged to replace an additional 3,000 staff with participants of the Gateway scheme. Rather than admit that its approach to public sector reform and management of it was ill-advised, or rethinking the public sector recruitment embargo, as it should do, this Government has invented a new and nasty scheme, using victims of the economic crash to, as set out in the Department's documentation "Do the work that the local authority used to undertake but no longer has the resources to carry out." That is the intended purpose of the Gateway scheme. The Gateway scheme is not designed with the needs of the long-term unemployed in mind, or to enhance the future employment prospects of the unemployed. The raison d'être of this scheme is to provide chronically under-funded local authorities with cheap general dogsbodies. During the 22 months that a jobseeker participates in the Gateway scheme he or she is at the disposal of the local council. What must be done and when, including working on Sundays, is left to the whim of the local council manager. Local authorities can vary the work of the jobseeker as the authorities' needs rather than the jobseeker's learning or work experience needs dictate. All of this work, which will be physically demanding hard labour, will be mainly outdoor work such as litter collection, landscaping, animal control and clearing brown field sites and is to be done for an additional €20 per week, which is equal to €1 per hour worked. That is a disgrace. Even this top-up can be eroded by tax. I sought confirmation of this from the Department and was provided with a table demonstrating that after PRSI, some people will be negatively affected. They will not get the €20 per week being held out as a carrot to those who are in receipt of long-term unemployment payments. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and Minister of State, Deputy Costello, will be aware that people who participated in community employment schemes benefited in terms of training and experience. Gateway compares poorly with the community employment scheme, in respect of which the Minister, Deputy Burton, slashed the training and materials grant, which decision she subsequently had to row back on. CE involves accredited training, leading to recognised awards under the National Framework of Qualifications. It now has a budget of €1,000 per annum per participant. Gateway involves no structured training and no formal training beyond the minimal health and safety course which is required by the host council's insurance policy. Gateway's only budget is for helmets and wellington boots. The employability of those who participate in Gateway will not be enhanced. There is no money for training. I want to address the issue of compulsion. This is a compulsory scheme. A jobseeker whose name is selected by an official in the Department of Social Protection for participation in this scheme must participate in the scheme for 22 months. The Gateway scheme is in many ways a carbon copy of the Tús scheme, which was roundly condemned by the Labour Party when it was first proposed by former Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív. Once in government the Labour Party did a U-turn - one of the many it has done since taking office - and introduced Tús. The main criticism of Tús is that it has no training budget and does not guarantee a jobseeker any recognised qualification which would assist his or her employment prospects. Jobseekers do not freely participate in Gateway. Instead, they are selected by the Department. Those selected have no choice but to participate under threat of loss of their social welfare payment, on which income support they and their families rely. Therein lies the punitive truth of this scheme. It is a scheme of forced labour. During its century in existence, the Labour Party has prided itself on its links with the trade union movement and the trade unions' promotion of better pay and conditions. The Gateway scheme breaches the C29 Forced Labour Convention which this State ratified in 1931. That is a fact. Article 1.1 of that convention states:Each Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this convention undertakes to suppress the use of forced or compulsory labour in all its forms within the shortest possible period.Article 2.1 states:For the purpose of this convention the term forced or compulsory labour shall mean all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.I urge the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his colleagues, not alone in Fine Gael but in the Labour Party, to read that convention. The Gateway and Tús schemes contravene that convention in the context of the menace of penalty involved. It is forced labour. The Gateway scheme also falls foul of that convention in all its manifestations and will do so unless withdrawn. This case is persuasively made by an insightful report on Gateway that has been put together and submitted as a complaint to the International Labour Organisation by Adam Ó Braonáin, a community development activist involved in the establishment of a jobseekers' forum in Monaghan. I will forward a copy of it to the Minister for Social Protection, who would do well to read it. It is a pity she did not review the law before setting about introducing this scheme. While participating in Gateway, a jobseeker's allowance from the Department of Social Protection will be replaced by a payment from the employing council.That will be administered by Pobal, which will basically give the council the money to pass on. A problem arises in this regard because local authorities will be able to use their own disciplinary procedures to suspend the payment of a family's entire income support in the case of a dispute with the Gateway participant. This falls outside the normal procedures that are applied by the Department of Social Protection. Again, that is a scandal and, as a result of the fact that compulsion is involved, it represents a breach of contract with the Department. Is it really fair to subject Gateway participants to the same disciplinary procedures as council employees without affording them the same terms and conditions, rates of pay, working hours and trade union representation? I am of the view that it is not fair and it is a shame that the Labour Party is behind this. The whole point of any activation scheme should ultimately be to promote entry to the labour force, that is, for the participant to proceed to secure full-time paid work. However, Gateway participants are required to give a minimum of one week's notice if they are fortunate to be offered full-time work. Failure to comply with this stipulation could have negative repercussions should the individual involved be unlucky to return to the live register in the future. In today's labour market people need to be able to jump at opportunities when they are offered. If there is an offer of immediate full-time paid employment, then the Gateway participant involved should be allowed to avail of it. Let it not be forgotten that they are not employees but they will be treated as such by the Department and local authorities. They certainly will not be treated as employees when their wages are set. The notice requirement will place Gateway participants at a significant disadvantage in comparison to other jobseekers who will still have the potential to take up job offers at a day's notice. People who are unlucky enough to be placed on the compulsory Gateway scheme will not be able to so from now on. As always, the Government had options. It did not need to introduce this punitive scheme of forced labour. Instead, it could have considered the alternatives. In that context, a good activation scheme is one that does not exploit or displace work - I have not mentioned displacement too much but my party colleagues will do so during their contributions; that first and foremost offers meaningful training and experience to the participant - from what is stated in the Department's documentation on the matter, Gateway falls well short in this regard; that enhances the future employment prospects of the participant - Gateway again falls short in that regard and may even hinder people's future prospects; and that allows jobseekers to apply to participate. Of course, the latter will not be allowed to apply to participate on Gateway. I have called on the Minister and the Government to withdraw the Gateway scheme, return to the drawing board and redevelop the community employment model, which is obviously not the bee's knees of employment schemes, in order that we might provide more meaningful opportunities for jobseekers. To date, the opportunity which exists in this regard has not been grasped. The Government could extend existing community employment schemes to involve appropriate structured training opportunities in a local authority context. Some such schemes throughout the country already work well with local authorities, which have an understanding of how they work. In addition, the Government could make short-term work experience opportunities available to the long-term unemployed on the basis of equal pay for equal work done. There is none of this in the Gateway scheme. For many years women in particular were obliged to fight for equality and for equal pay for equal work. In government, the Labour Party is now seeking to erode what has been achieved for those who are unlucky enough to be unemployed long term. I refer here to those who have been on the live register for two years or more. The Government's amendment to the motion is absolutely pathetic. The Government could not even argue against the points we made in our motion. Rather than do so, it decided to delete our entire motion and draft an amendment that is basically an exercise in self-congratulation. The amendment concludes with the Minister for Social Protection commending herself, which is bizarre. It is an absolute shame that a Labour Minister is introducing this scheme, which does not involve the provision of training, will lead to the displacement of local authority workers and in respect of which a measly and meagre rate of pay will apply, at this point. The Government should hang its head in shame on this issue.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	404	I mbuiséad 2013, chuir an Rialtas tús leis an scéim Gateway, a chuireann daoine dífhostaithe faoi bhrú dul ag obair ar feadh 19 uair go leith i gcomhair €20 sa bhreis ar an jobseeker's allowance. As my friend, Deputy Ó Snodaigh pointed out, the Gateway scheme compels unemployed people to carry out work for local authorities, with threats of cuts to or suspension of welfare payments if they do not comply. This is despite the fact that only a fraction of the minimum wage will be paid in return for such work. Where does Labour stand in the context of this particular transaction? No training will be provided, nor will there be any prospect of long-term employment for those being forced to accept places on Gateway. Where stands Labour in respect of that matter? Gateway punishes the unemployed for being unemployed and copperfastens the understaffing of essential local services. Even if an unemployed person is motivated to do so, he or she cannot apply to participate on Gateway. Instead, the victim is selected by the Department of Social Protection. If, for whatever reason, he or she declines to participate, he or she will risk a reduction in or total loss of his or her social welfare income support. That is what makes Gateway similar to the Tús initiative originally conceived by Fianna Fáil. We did not have time to research what the Labour Party had to say about that initiative when it was introduced. However, it is clear that it was an anti-class and anti-fraud - so-called - measure rather than an activation measure. The €20 top-up to be paid to Gateway participants will be subject to PRSI and in some cases it will be almost completely eroded. For example, a parent with four children could be obliged to pay €18 or €20 in PRSI. Local authorities have been given 3,000 places to fill but surely - again we must ask what is Labour's position on this matter - the citizens who take them up deserve proper terms and conditions and to have their rights, as workers, respected. The Gateway scheme expressly intends that participants will do work which local authorities no longer carry out as a result of the recruitment embargo. I presume the demand for such work remains but it cannot be done as a result of Government policy. The upshot is that this yellow-pack version of a community employment scheme is being introduced to fill the void. The Gateway scheme is also being introduced in the aftermath of local authority funding being drastically slashed and in an environment where the public service embargo continues to hold sway. In the past year alone, 3,000 jobs have been axed from local authorities. The notion of using cheap - almost free - labour should be repugnant to anyone who is a member of the labour movement. It is nothing but exploitation of unemployed citizens. People become annoyed when they contrast that with the deference paid to others in society. For example, €500 million has been taken out of the local authority budget and given to Irish Water. Some €75 million or €85 million of this was paid to consultants and the remainder will be spent on installing water meters. None of this expenditure will lead to the creation of sustainable jobs.The Government is not serious about this being an employment scheme. In my constituency of Louth the target figure for inclusion in the Gateway scheme is 80. The unemployment figure for Louth is 16,000. A total of 80 places out of 16,000 is not exactly a jobs initiative even if these were by any measure real jobs. The scheme follows on the heels of JobBridge, which also exploits welfare recipients with little hope of gaining long-term employment or skills training. If there was real investment in indigenous Irish business, for example, the building of primary health services or health centres throughout the State - not only where the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly wants them - or real investment to provide real jobs by developing services, for example, to fix the leaking water system rather than install meters outside people's homes in order that people can be charged for water, then we would be making some fist of it. The Government should withdraw the scheme - a first step would be to withdraw the shameful Government amendment - and support the Sinn Féin motion.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	405	The Gateway scheme as proposed by the Government is an exploitative measure. It takes advantage of a sector of Irish society made up of those who have found themselves in a vulnerable position, that is, being unemployed. The Government has decided to punish unemployed people for being unemployed. Thomas Davis, the famous Irish patriot, said "Educate that you may be Free". This is the key to fighting against unemployment and to the creation of a diverse and dynamic economy. Gateway does not provide for brighter futures or include training or education mechanisms and, as such, it does not enhance the employability of participants. Fully 61.4% of those now unemployed are in long-term unemployment. The Government must realise that to change the trend of unemployment in the country it must change the way it deals with unemployment. Opportunities to return to education, upskill and diversify must be made available to those who are unlucky enough to find themselves unemployed. Any policy should also include a review of the higher education grant scheme, which puts the most extraordinary obstacles in front of people, particularly younger people who were working and then laid off or who were self-employed and then forced out of business, to qualify for higher education grants. Is forced emigration still a budgetary strategy of the Government? The question of what work is worth must also be asked. Under the Gateway scheme unemployed people are forced to carry out work for local authorities through the threat of cuts and suspension to welfare payments. People are forced into 22 months' hard labour and in return receive a measly top-up of €20 per week. There is a term for someone who does not have the right to withdraw his labour and that is a slave. Gateway is nothing more then state-sanctioned slave labour. This, at the same time that cuts are being made to council services. Real jobs with real wages are being taken out of the economy. Bob Crow, former general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers passed away today, Lord rest him. I imagine the House will join me in commiserating his loss. When he was asked about the outsourcing of jobs he said: "If you have robots build cars, how are robots going to buy them?" If we take real jobs out of the economy and replace them with the likes of the Gateway scheme it will have a knock-on effect on the real economy. Replacing someone who used to earn a full wage with someone who gets €20 on top of his social welfare payment means that shops, bars, restaurants and, ultimately, other people's jobs will suffer. This scheme is part of a litany of mistakes made by the Government in dealing with the unemployment crisis. The JobBridge scheme should be called the JobBridge scam because it is being used by many companies to avail of free labour instead of hiring people on a decent wage. Behind the Gateway scam is a right-wing belief that unemployed people are unemployed by choice and that they should be forced into work. It is this same right-wing thinking that has landed us in the economic mess we are in currently and which has resulted in thousands being forced to join the dole queues. The architects of our economic crash prosper while the victims of the crash emigrate or are forced into slave labour. Little wonder that people are angry and disillusioned with politics and politicians.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	406	I imagine we will be told tonight by the Government side that the crisis is over, that the economy is healthy and that the live register is going down. I suppose this will be the spin from the Government side. Recent figures show that there are 61,000 more people in work than the previous corresponding 12-month period and I accept that. However, the figures quietly ignore that much of this can be attributed to emigration and a change in the Central Statistics Office measurement tools, or that the vast majority of jobs are being created in the low pay and low skills sectors. The Government has continually set out to attack those on social welfare and cut the associated payments. In 2014 the Government cut unemployment benefit for those under 25 years of age and publicly stated that this would entice more people into work. Has that happened? I do not believe it has. It did not and it has not. What it did was force more and more people on the flight path to emigration as well as pushing many more into deeper poverty. Let us consider the sad and bleak figures and remember that there is a story behind every figure. A total of 127,000 people of working age have left the country since 2009. Recent research has shown that 60% of Irish emigrants were in employment when they left. The numbers of people emigrating in search of jobs or because the jobs here do not offer progressive career paths or opportunities as well as the numbers stuck in low pay or who lack sufficient working hours make it clear that there is a serious problem in our so-called healthy jobs sector. The Government decided in its wisdom that all these people needed a little more experience. It set up JobBridge to make jobseekers work full-time jobs for a few bob on top of their dole. Is it not legitimate to ask that if we offer companies free labour, then why would they ever hire full-time properly paid employees? I imagine this is the question that many people listening to this debate will be asking. The scheme is a failure and akin to the exploiting of vulnerable people who cannot say "No" or question the validity of the programmes that the Government is putting them on. A 22 month long stint with a county or city council is being offered, but this does not involve quality training or enhance employability and it is not voluntary. Basically, it is a scheme that is being foisted on the unemployed to get them to work a full-time job for €20 on top of their dole payment, as mentioned by other speakers. Is €20 going to get people back to work? It costs people money to go to work. In many cases this princely sum does not cover expenses. Those working 19 and a half hours per week on the Gateway scheme will get less than €1 per hour extra. The scheme allows local councils to circumvent the recruitment embargo and get some cheap jobs done at the same time. The scheme cannot be accused of innovation, it will not have a positive impact on long-term unemployed people and it is not in keeping with best international practice. For many, it is seen as a direct attack on workers' rights and an abuse of vulnerable jobseekers. It is time for the Government to stop its attack of people on social welfare and instead focus on creating real enduring jobs. This is a problem throughout Europe. We have consistently called for a robustly funded youth guarantee scheme to ensure every young person in the State can avail of a real job or training place. There can be no recovery without jobs and these are among the options the Government could take instead of implementing these madcap schemes.For example, we have called for the use of the discretionary fund of €6.4 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund. In addition, we have called for no more cuts in the capital expenditure budget to invest in a roll-out of essential infrastructure such as the A5 road completion, school and primary care centre build, completion of regeneration projects, the comprehensive roll-out of broadband, and an upgrading of the water system, rather than the introduction of water meters.  We have asked the Government to seek European Investment Bank-matched funding for the re-establishment of the sugar beet industry in the south east, the development of Knock Airport, the regeneration of the Cork docklands, and the deepening of the harbour berths at Rosslare. We have called for the establishment, with the pension industry, of investment in a green bank that will fund the roll-out of energy retrofitting and generate stable returns higher than Government bonds for the pension industry. These are the options we are outlining, which the Government should consider.

There is spin about a recovery and job creation, in addition to spin about the likes of the Taoiseach and his friend Frank Flannery sharing the pain of working people. Not a Deputy or Senator is unaware of how empty all that old guff about recovery is, when we see people from our own areas every day who are suffering due to this Government's policies. People are frantic with worry and stress. Many have experienced tragic circumstances because of the impossibility of adequately supporting their families in this State due to the Government's continuous austerity policies. This Gateway outrage is more of it. Gateway forces unemployed people to carry out work for local authorities through the threat of cuts and suspensions to welfare payments. It is a cheap, exploitative scheme which will then be presented to the people as a job creation exercise because it massages the live register figures. In fact, it is punitive and takes advantage of people by forcing them into slave labour for local authorities which, of course, need workers but cannot employ them due to the recruitment embargo. Surely it must breach the most basic principles of labour law and the international convention on forced labour. Has the Minister ever thought this through? What will it do to the morale of local authority workers to be working alongside people who are forced to do the job for €20 per week? The Taoiseach and Tánaiste smiled for the cameras with Angela Merkel last week. They were like three cats that got the cream on the steps of Government Buildings. Back slapping and self-congratulation was the order of the day. The founders of the Labour Party must be somersaulting in their graves. However, there is another aspect to the suffering being meted out by Fine Gael and Labour. They are not just visiting this burden on the working people of today, but arranging it so that future generations too will look back on this Fine Gael-Labour Government as the one which rolled back the hard-won gains of the trade union movement down through the decades. God be with the days when the Labour Party stood up to the bosses and the Government to defend working people against this kind of exploitation. If this was not being forced upon people, what union, shop steward or shop-floor worker would accept it? How can Labour Party members tolerate support for a scheme which forces people into 22 months of hard labour for a welfare top-up of €20 that can be eroded by tax? It does not include training, does not feature education and does not make it easier for anyone to get a job afterwards. It is a product of the ideological rot that has set into the Labour Party, suggesting that the unemployed are the problem in our economy and not unemployment, which is made worse by the Government's own austerity policies. It is dehumanising people who have lost their jobs and punishing them by making them slaves. The plan is to employ up to 80 people on this scheme in Kerry. What choice will they have when the Minister is threatening to cut their social welfare if they do not enter into this work-for-benefits scheme? There are two important facts to note in this regard. First, when this Government took office 55.1% of the unemployed were unfortunately long-term. Now, after three years of this Fine Gael-Labour coalition, 61.4% of those without work are long-term unemployed. Second, there has been a 25% reduction in local authority workers since 2011. In view of this, local authorities are struggling to provide the most basic services or even deal with the emergency situation caused by the recent savage storms. I call on the Government not to go ahead with this scheme. It should stop it now and instead look for the alternatives in activation schemes, centred on a training-based community employment scheme. Such a scheme should, by right, be non-exploitative and based on what I believed was a rock-solid principle of the trade union movement and the Labour Party - equal pay for equal work. I am calling on Labour Party Deputies to prove me wrong when I say that if they go along with this, they can no longer claim to be a Labour Party. They will well and truly have crossed the ideological line and joined Fine Gael as a party of the right, which has no conscience about shamelessly exploiting workers. I call on all Deputies to support this motion and protect workers' rights that have been fought for long and hard.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	408	I wanted to get an idea of the track record of the Government in providing jobs and training for people, so I looked up the JobBridge website today. The first advertisement I found was for an Advance Pitstop position which had been filled 28 times previously by the JobBridge scheme. This was not about providing jobs, it was about exploiting people as much as possible until they were thrown back on the heap. Advance Pitstop is a disgrace and so is the Minister who allows this to carry on. Gateway is no better. The principle of Gateway, the fact that it exists and could be proposed by a member of the Labour Party no less, is an insult to the idea that people have any rights. It says clearly that fair treatment, decency and respect are privileges that one earns with the accumulation of wealth. It says that if people are young, uneducated and out of work for any reason, they do not deserve something as basic as a decent day's pay for a decent day's work. It denies flatly that if a job is worth having done it is worth paying for. In its implementation, the State and local authorities, like the businesses in JobBridge, exemplify the destructive, exploitative nature of capitalism that its strongest proponents so flatly deny. If a job is worth doing it is worth paying for. It is worth a decent wage for that decent day's work. That is what we are fighting to uphold when we fight against Gateway and JobBridge and other such schemes. They do not activate employment but further incentivise and legitimise the worst cases of exploitation. In this State where the Taoiseach earns more than most EU leaders, the Labour Party now feels that the worst-off should work for free. Unemployed people in an economy which has not seen a major growth in job numbers, will now be forced to work for a €20 top-up on their dole for 22 long months. That is not even enough for a weekly bus pass, especially since this Government decided to hike up fares every six months. The Government claims this will give unemployed people experience which will help them to get a job. Training is important but we have seen the kind of training provided by Labour-designed job activation policies. JobBridge was not a method of getting training and experience for people without jobs, and neither will Gateway. No account is taken of existing experience of the people being forced to slave for virtually nothing. Through JobBridge people with qualifications who have simply lost out to the economic collapse are being asked to take unpaid work cutting chips in the local fast-food restaurant or washing floors. How is sweeping streets or planting trees any better as a form of training? If these jobs need to be done, they should be paid for. One cannot create jobs by forcing people to work. JobBridge only created profit for the unscrupulous who will exploit it. Gateway will actively discourage councils from creating real jobs, relying instead on the team of free workers straight out of the dole queue. Those selected randomly and forced to slave will have to do so for 19.5 hours a week. That means they are being paid less than €1 an hour, except that 20 cent will be subject to PRSI. I do not know how the Labour Party could stomach this, much less propose and implement it. It is disgusting. The scheme includes no structured formal training. It is worthless to those who will be forced to take part but lucrative for the Government, or so it hopes, which will claim further success in reducing joblessness when it has 3,000 people working for nothing.Real people, with families and homes need real jobs that pay real wages. They need training in some cases but training that will genuinely put them in a position to find work. If labour activation was so important to this Government, community employment schemes would have been improved, but instead they were nearly done away with altogether. If training was really important to this Government, third level education would not become more and more expensive for ordinary people. Schools would not be forced to cut the cloth closer each year. Grants supporting people returning to education would not be so difficult to access. That would be a real drive towards training and upskilling. It would not help the Government to spend a little money investing in people while also saving money by running local services on the cheap with free labour. This scheme stinks. It is a scam, just like JobBridge, and no one is fooled.

I have listened with some interest to the debate but I am somewhat perplexed. Every independent commentator on the Irish welfare system has observed that we were trapping people in idleness, that we divorced the payments system from the activation system, and that we did not create the developmental welfare system whereby people on welfare are supported to take on new opportunities. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is seeking to turn our welfare system completely around to make it a system for helping people to avail of new opportunities to develop their skills. Most particularly, it aims to help people who have been a long time out of work. The Pathways to Work scheme is not just about developing new skills. The Intreo offices are a new approach, a one-stop-shop approach where cash payments and information on opportunities are provided. These offices provide active engagement with the welfare system with the promotion of job search and training opportunities and giving people the opportunity to move on from the live register. There has been criticism of the failure to deal with our welfare system in the crash. The Minister for Social Protection is taking on this task. She inherited a difficult situation which many here have acknowledged. Long-term unemployment was exceedingly high, at 150,000 in 2011, but today that figure has been decreased to just over 100,000. The number of long-term unemployed, as reported by the quarterly national household survey, has dropped by well over 25%, nearly by one third. That is a significant achievement against a backdrop of a serious problem. This has been built on real opportunities for helping people who are out of work to develop their skills. The Opposition shadow spokespersons will know that the probability of a person getting work falls dramatically past the six months, 12 months, 18 months and two years out of work. The probability after 18 months out of work is only one tenth, a one in ten chance, of getting placed, compared with a 50% chance of work in the early stages of unemployment. There is a well-documented and proven problem that the longer a person remains on the live register, the more difficult it is to access opportunities. That is combined with the damage to self-esteem, the ability to self-start, and to see a pathway to develop skills. We have very consciously sought to develop alternative opportunities. It is interesting that the motion has picked the Gateway scheme which is one of what I reckon to be about 115,000 alternative opportunities being provided by this Government to assist people to develop their skills. Gateway provides about 3,000 opportunities out of 115,000. Even the Opposition will have to admit that the range of options offers a wide scope. Deputies rightly spoke about the need for training and education and for a different mix. The range is there for all to see. I was amazed that not a single speaker mentioned Springboard, which is designed for a person who has been out of work who wants to reskill and change direction, or MOMENTUM, which is a scheme on the job and off the job. There are 6,000 people on Springboard and 6,500 people on MOMENTUM. Deputies referred to JobBridge but solely in a critical way. The truth about JobBridge is that 60% of those who have participated in it have been placed either directly with the sponsoring company or with other companies. This is a very high placement rate. The vocational training and opportunities scheme has 5,000 people in education programmes. Twenty-five thousand people are participating in back to education schemes. The intention of the Government in introducing Gateway is to provide a broad range of options which need to include intensive training elements and a mix of options and also work experience as an objective. Gateway does not pretend to be a Springboard or a MOMENTUM. It is another option in a menu of options.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22276	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	411	It is important to see this in the context of a range of schemes. I refer to the additional part-time training which is available to a person on the Gateway scheme. FÁS provides approximately 15,000 part-time training courses. JobsPlus is the new grant scheme targeted at people who have been unemployed more than one or two years. A total of 1,600 people are participating in that scheme and 60% of them have been more than two years unemployed. This scheme has been very successful in targeting that cohort which is difficult to place. The same is true of Gateway which is targeting a group of people who are particularly difficult to place in order to find real work opportunities for them. Where better to look for such opportunities than to our local authorities. They are established in the community with a very strong work ethic and human resources and other support structures to provide a good working environment for participants. Pretending that local authorities are some form of sweat shops as portrayed by the Opposition is an insult to local authorities and to the way in which they will deal with the participants in the schemes. They work to the highest standards in the workplace. They provide the supports needed by people who have been long-term unemployed. I make no apology for having this range of alternatives, including Gateway, which provides 19.5 hours work a week. People complain that €208 a week, an additional €20 a week, is a very low payment. It is not a high payment but I have never heard people rail against community employment which has been a feature of our system for years and 25,000 people are employed on community employment schemes. They are given the opportunity to work, to develop their skills with a placement rate of 26% for work. That rate could be higher. We need a range of programmes and we need to see people progress from a scheme that takes them from being in a very difficult place in their lives and moves them to something in which they can progress. Local authorities have the structures to help people develop their skills and interests. Participants are given a chance to learn about different aspects of local authority work and to gain experience. The hope is that they will progress their skills and move on. This is the process we are seeking to evolve and it has been successful. In 2013, 137,500 people left the live register to take up employment.This notion that the jobs we are creating are not available to people on the live register is simply incorrect. In fact, as I have outlined, significant numbers are leaving the live register to take up employment. Pathways to Work is one part of our strategy to get people back into employment. Deputy Crowe denigrated the information we provide and claimed we are all about public relations when it comes to job creation. The Central Statistics Office is not a PR agent of the Department. It has been gathering statistics year in and year out for as long as I have been around and is highly respected for the way in which it presents its information. Opposition Members are entitled to attack Government policy, but the Deputy will admit-----

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22276	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	417	The increase in employment of 61,000 in the past 12 months - or 66,500 if one looks only at the private sector - is nothing to do with increased emigration. These are extra people at work in Ireland today. Emigration could be any number, but the fact is there are additional people in work who were not in work 12 months ago. The past five quarters have seen increases in the employment rate. Over that period, we have seen well over 80,000 additional people at work in the private sector, which is a dramatic improvement on what went before. Deputy Crowe knows as well as I do that the preceding years saw net reductions in employment, of 160,000 in one year, for example, and 50,000 in another. Now we are seeing enterprises being created and new opportunities opening up. Our challenge is to ensure those who are out of work get a fair crack at the 66,500 new opportunities in the private sector. That is what Pathways to Work is all about. The figure of 137,500 people coming off the live register gives an indication that there is a lift for those who are out of work, but we need to keep working at it. The Deputy is right that it is sometimes easier for companies to hire somebody straight from school rather than from the live register. That is why we have introduced schemes like JobsPlus, which offers a subsidy of €72 per week to employers who take on a person who has been out of work for 12 months or more. Where people are out of work for two years, which is the cohort about which we are talking with Gateway, the subsidy increases to €100 per week for two years. These types of incentives are vital to creating a level playing pitch in the recruitment race for such opportunities. We are trying to provide a range of options for those who are out of work. In that context, I absolutely defend our having a programme run by the local authorities which offers real work experience in a well-organised workplace. It is really worthwhile and something we ought to promote. It is not fair for Deputy Crowe to come in here and present it as some type of slave labour scheme. He must consider the whole spectrum of what is being offered, including Springboard, JobBridge and JobsPlus. There is a range of different offers with which we are seeking to match people's needs. The other issue with which the Deputy was concerned is the expectation that if people are offered an opportunity, they will participate. The reality is that this is a well-established principle that applies right across all the activation regimes in Europe of which I am aware. As a joint member, with the Minister for Social Protection, of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, I am aware that the concept of a contract whereby people are expected, where they get a reasonable offer, to take it up is generally accepted across all EU member states. The notion that there is some expectation and therefore some sanction if people refuse to participate in worthwhile programmes is the norm right across the system and reflects the concept of a developmental welfare system. The National Economic and Social Council pronounced on this issue some years ago, but perhaps it was not sufficiently heeded. The principle is that this is a two-way street - that Government creates a range of options which give people a chance to develop themselves, but there is also an expectation that they will engage. All the evidence I have seen supports this approach. I used to participate in the National Economic and Social Forum and all pillars of that forum accepted this notion of a contract whereby Government creates opportunities and there is an expectation that people will avail of them. That is the correct approach and it is the one adopted in most countries, including those which are not facing as great an unemployment challenge as we are. The longer people are out of the workplace the more difficult it is to place them and the more demoralised they can become. The system we have been developing is one over which we absolutely can stand. The Deputy referred to the need to develop new training opportunities, a point with which I entirely agree. We are at a pivotal point where we need to see a much stronger commitment by employers to develop traineeships, apprenticeships and new forms of training. One of the problems we had, which was aggravated by the Celtic tiger boom years, was that everybody was of the view that the academic route was the route to go and employers allowed good traineeships to decay. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, and his officials have highlighted the fact that there used to be 40 traineeship programmes but now there are only 18. That decline did not happen because the State was not willing to support those programme but because the on-the-job element required to make them a success was lacking. Another factor was that apprenticeships fell through the floor with the collapse of the construction sector. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, has recently published a review of apprenticeships. We are at a point now where we can, with considerable confidence for the future, push out new models of traineeship and apprenticeship and seek to encourage employers to buy into that effort on a more permanent basis. If one considers the countries in Europe that have weathered the recession better than we have, a strong tradition of maintaining traineeships and apprenticeships is most likely a feature. Commentators often cite Germany and Austria in this regard, with particular reference to the so-called mittelstand companies where this has been a feature. These are strong companies that have been able to withstand the recession. We, too, need to build an industrial base of companies which will make that type of commitment to training. As I understand it, SOLAS will produce its own strategy statement within weeks. One of its main challenges, as I see it, will be to build out that platform for our growing private sector.

We can learn from what has been done there.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22276	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	419	The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, is considering that concept of building a social clause into public contracts, which would include, for instance, a quota of apprentices from the live register. I understand it is being piloted and there is an ambition to expand. I hope we are coming to a point in our economic recovery where more employers will be willing to engage with that. I have heard a number of sectoral groups making the argument that they could increase the numbers they employ if they had the appropriate trainees. It takes two to tango in this regard and we cannot expect the State to do everything. I am somewhat disappointed at the negative tone of the Sinn Féin motion and I cannot support it for that reason. I accept that we need to have a spectrum of offerings, which is what we are seeking to do. The emphasis in the motion on training and opportunity is right, but I absolutely defend the Gateway programme within local authorities.It involves high quality work places and good people to work with. It is a good experience to shadow people with real skill in a workplace that has high standards and is a good working environment. Like the community employment scheme, which has also been good, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, this scheme offers a good opportunity. I have never heard a moment's criticism of community employment, which is set up on the same basis. I think this scheme will also prove itself to be good. It is not the answer to our unemployment problem. It constitutes less than 3% of the offering that the Departments are making to people who are out of work. That is all it is. If it is seen in that perspective, it will be clear that it fits into a spectrum of offering. I agree that we have a long way to go as we try to turn the tide. That is acknowledged in our amendment. We still have an unemployment rate of approximately 12%. We still have a net emigration level of 35,000. We need to build on the positive things that are happening. We should exploit the new training and work experience opportunities that are emerging in parts of the private sector that have been pretty much closed to any thinking about recruitment, training or apprenticeships for the last four or five years.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	420	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this evening's debate on the Gateway scheme. Since the recent announcement of the roll-out of Gateway placements to local authorities, I have received a number of inquiries from constituents who would like to know how they can apply for placements. While the Opposition will oppose for the sake of it, I have absolutely no doubt that this scheme will be welcomed by many people. The aim of the Gateway scheme is to try to help the long-term unemployed back into the workforce. When a person has been out of work for a number of years, it affects their confidence. Such people can quickly lose track of the regular daily routine. Some unemployed people stay up late at night and stay in bed late the following day not through laziness, but because they do not have a purpose for getting up in the morning. When a person falls into this trap, it can have a devastating impact on his or her mental health. We are all familiar with the success of programmes like Tús, the community employment scheme and the rural social scheme. Last week, I was contacted by a constituent who completed a 12-month term on a community employment scheme last year and is now very eager to apply for a Gateway placement. When I inquired into the matter, I discovered that he is not eligible for Gateway because the period he spent on a community employment scheme does not count towards the requirement to have spent 24 months as a jobseeker. The person in question was extremely disappointed to learn that he is ineligible. He could quite easily have sat at home and received his jobseeker's payment, but instead he wanted to work and engage with the system. He told me he was fed up looking at the same four walls throughout the day and he wanted an opportunity to do something productive. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to allowing time spent on programmes like the community employment and Tús schemes to count towards the requirement to have spent 24 months as a jobseeker. Alternatively, it should be possible for some discretion to be shown at local level when eligibility for the Gateway scheme is being determined. I welcome the decision to provide 55 placement opportunities each to Monaghan and Cavan county councils this year and thereby allow participants in the scheme to gain valuable work experience. I do not doubt that this will assist them when they try to secure employment in the future. At the same time, they will be contributing to their local communities. I have listened to some of the scaremongering with regard to this scheme. It is not true that college graduates will be forced to take up work such as cleaning streets. Indeed, the manner in which this has been suggested is insulting to the hard-working people who currently carry out such necessary work on behalf of local authorities. The selection process for Gateway placements will involve an interview and a skills-matching process. I have no doubt that the Department of Social Protection and the local authorities will seek to ensure participants are matched with placements that are suitable to their qualifications and experience. I want to commend the Minister, Deputy Burton, on her proactive approach to labour activation. The Opposition is continuing to criticise schemes like JobBridge, but there is overwhelming evidence that they are helping people to find their way into the workforce. I believe the Gateway scheme will have a similarly positive impact on many people. It will give them an opportunity to put their existing work skills into practice, thereby standing them in good stead when they are seeking employment in the future. I will conclude by asking the Minister again to take on board my suggestion that it should be possible for periods of time spent on community employment schemes to count towards the requirement to have spent 24 months as a jobseeker.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	421	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to tonight's debate on the merits of the Gateway scheme. I would like to clarify some of the misconceptions that have deliberately been introduced to the discussion on this matter by people who are more interested in political opportunism than in genuine or real concern for the well-being of unemployed people. I welcome the measures that have been introduced by the Department of Social Protection since this Government came into office. The Department is moving away from the era when its role was confined to merely issuing cheques to the unemployed. We often hear about the dignity of people. I think there is nothing more degrading than issuing someone a cheque week in, week out to keep them at home, rather than making a real and meaningful effort to help them get back into the labour force. I commend the Minister and the Government on the steps they have taken to make changes in the Department. While it is a slow process, it is a very productive one. Many people in my constituency are extremely grateful for the opportunities that are now being offered to them by the Department of Social Protection. The Gateway scheme gives people an opportunity to take up temporary part-time employment for 22 months. They get €11 an hour for working 19.5 hours a week. Participants in the scheme are entitled to take up other part-time work, if they are willing and able to do so, without having any penalty applied to what they are paid. The minimum payment anyone can receive is €208 a week, but this can increase to €400 a week depending on the person's circumstances. The 19.5 hours of work in a structured environment that is involved in this scheme can be undertaken in any of a wide variety of placements in the local authority sector. The compulsion element of this scheme has been much maligned in this House and other forums. The reality is that people will not be made to do something they do not want to do. The councils and the local authorities will be at pains to help individuals to match their skill bases with the wide and varied array of jobs that are undertaken by local authorities day in, day out. Anyone who has a genuine reason for not being able to take up a placement will have no difficulty whatsoever. The reality is that there is an element of people who are double-jobbing while drawing benefits or not making any effort to find work. That has to be targeted. I welcome that aspect of this scheme. A degree of hypocrisy is evident in Sinn Féin's opposition to this scheme. The youth employment scheme in the North of Ireland, which is very similar to this scheme, offers people £15.38 a week in addition to their benefits. Their hypocrisy in coming down to the South to oppose the very same scheme brings partitionism to a new low.

Tomorrow night, I will think about the many fathers who have contacted me on behalf of their 22, 23 and 24 year old sons or daughters who have not worked for three or four years and would love an opportunity to get on this scheme.The scheme offers them a chance for real dignity and real participation. With them in mind I will be supporting the Government's amendment to the motion tomorrow night.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	434	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion, which we will be supporting. It mainly concerns the Gateway scheme, which everyone knows is a very different scheme from the community employment scheme. While I am not trying to be partisan or unduly critical, I never thought I would see the day when a Government, one third of which is made up of Labour Party members and which could not continue in office but for their support, would even contemplate something like this, let alone implement it. While they have not come in here tonight, I am amazed that they could go to the media outside and justify it. This is workfare, pure and simple. It is undisguised, unabashed, in-your-face workfare. At the time of the last Conservative Party conference in the United Kingdom what the British Government was doing on social welfare loomed large. I was asked to write a newspaper article at the time comparing and contrasting the Irish Government's approach and the British Government's approach. Having studied the proceedings of the Conservative Party conference, I cannot say I was surprised, but I was certainly very disappointed at the underlying philosophy - the barely concealed contempt for the unemployed, which is typical of the Conservative Party right wing. That is the social welfare policy being pursued by the present British Government, tempered to some extent by the presence of the Liberal Democrats in government. I have been amazed at the extent to which that thinking and policy is being followed to a greater extent in this country by a Government that includes the Labour Party. The two policies and philosophies are beginning to converge. The precursor to this scheme appeared in the last budget whereby young people under the age of 26 would have their social welfare, which is paltry enough - perhaps it is all the country can afford but in the great scheme of things it is paltry - slashed if they allegedly were not prepared to participate in non-existent training schemes or because they could not get non-existent jobs. No account was taken of the fact that at the time there were at least 32 applicants for every job vacancy. Despite the so-called employment creation of the past 12 months, the ratio is probably not much better - it has probably improved by virtue of emigration in the past 12 months. It is demonstrable that insufficient places were provided to satisfy the needs of everybody who wanted a training place. Even though they did not have the opportunity of getting a training place, their social welfare, paltry as it may have been, was slashed. In other words they were punished for being unemployed. However, it was the underlying philosophy that disturbed me most. The snide inference was that the young unemployed in this country are a lazy, idle, shiftless lot who would prefer to spend their time lolling around the place rather than taking up any of the numerous well-paid jobs that are available, or who do not want to take up any of the well-established training or education places that would qualify them for such a job. That is a false image and the Government should have long since apologised for trying to create that image. Some Labour Party backbenchers went so far as to paint a picture of people sitting around for seven nights a week watching flat-screen televisions rather than getting off their backsides and going out and looking for work that was no doubt there. It was the Norman Tebbit philosophy of "get on your bike" and if people just try hard enough they will get a job or a training place so there is no need to pay them the full rate of social welfare - in fact why should they be getting paid any social welfare at all? This proposal is not just more of the same - it goes much further. Despite all the Johns, Marys and everybody else who might want to participate in the scheme, it is not a question of people choosing or looking to participate in the scheme if they wished. The reality is as follows. Certain people who are unfortunate to be long-term unemployed will be selected - by what process nobody knows, least of all themselves. They will be summoned into the Department of Social Protection and told they will have to work on a scheme and if they do not to it their welfare will either be reduced or suspended entirely. In other words the Department of Social Protection will starve them out when their welfare is suspended entirely. That is the reality. The individuals have no choice in the matter despite what has been said here tonight. They have no opportunity to refuse or question what is being imposed on them and they have no right of appeal, as I understand it. The job they will be offered will, as has been said, be outdoor work, often hard enough labour, for a local authority for half a working week for the following two years for the princely sum of €1 per hour on top of the social welfare they would have been getting anyway. I believe the girls in the textile factories in China were being paid a bit more than that even in Mao Zedong's time. I recently pointed out to the Minister for Social Protection that the internationally accepted poverty standard, 60% of median income, is in this country for a single individual about €210 per week. The rate of social welfare at €188 per week is approximately €20 shy of that. The Minister's response was that such people would have a medical card, which she claims is worth €1,000 and therefore they exceed the poverty line. I wonder what happens here to people on medical cards. Let us consider a single individual who is in receipt of €188 per week jobseeker's allowance. As it stands he is €4 a week over the limit for a medical card but because his only income is social welfare he will get the medical card. As this will notionally take him another €20 a week over the limit, will he lose his medical card? On the face of it, it would seem that he does. If he does, then he is back to square one. While I have not had time to study this in detail yet, I am assured there will also be PRSI implications. Therefore having lost the medical card he is back to €188, his disposable income falls by the extent by which he loses through having to pay PRSI. More importantly, going to work involves costs, including transport costs. Not every local authority can have its place of employment on somebody's doorstep so it will cost something to go to work. Therefore the person's disposable income falls further. Such people are now being told that if they do not take up a job where they will be working for half a week, locked in for the following two years, they will lose their social welfare. The job will pay them a minus income because their disposable income will be less than it was before they took up the so-called job in the first place. There is something seriously wrong with this. The scheme was initially sold because of the training content. While the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation distanced himself somewhat from that this evening, he still adverted to it in some ways.Regarding the jobs that are in contemplation, we all know what they are and I do not belittle them in any way but we must deal with reality. I do not believe training will be required to do those jobs, and they will not give people any training for future participation in the workforce. What type of training does one get picking up litter in the park, washing graffiti off walls or standing in a gap preventing animals moving from one space to another? We must put an end to this nonsense about training. There is no training element in this scheme.  The Taoiseach stated recently in this House that the purpose of the scheme was to get people into the habit of work because if they are long-term unemployed they have lost the habit of work but experience demonstrates that the people of this country are not work-shy. The reverse is the case. When we had full employment people availed of the opportunities that existed. The best way to get a person into the habit of work is to give them a job. If the jobs are available, they will apply for them. The need and desire to work is deeply ingrained in the Irish psyche. If nothing else proves that it is proved by the fact that in the past three years alone, 0.25 million people or one in eight of the adult population of this country left their kith and kin and the security of home to go to strange lands to seek employment when they could not get it here. That is a reality. The vast majority of those were young people under the age of 26 because the youth cohort of the Irish population has fallen from 16% to 12% in recent years. That is caused by emigration. I say this from the heart, and I am not being party political, but I am disappointed that the Labour Party Members have not come into the House tonight to listen to this debate. Is it that they cannot bear to listen to it or are they watching it on the monitors? I hope that is the case because we are living in the era of opinion polls. Various opinion polls are giving different results. I never take much account of opinion polls. I do my own opinion poll on a regular basis knocking on doors in Limerick and I can say to the Labour Party, particularly to the new young Labour Deputies who may still have a spark of idealism, that their situation on the ground is worse than the worst opinion polls I have seen.  It beggars belief that the Labour Party would stand by and support something that flies in the face of everything it ever professed to believe in. If those younger members of the Labour Parliamentary Party are holding on in the belief that a few months before the Government's constitutional term runs out they can pull the plug and say to the people that they have finally seen through Fine Gael, rediscovered their principles and will not take any more, it will not wash. What happened in 1987 proved that. It is getting very late now for the Labour Party to redeem itself. This would not be a bad chance at redemption. The younger Labour Deputies should approach their Ministers tomorrow, the people who represent them in the Government, and tell them that this is a bridge too far and that it is anathema to everything Labour believes in and has ever stood for. They should tell them to withdraw their opposition to this motion and rethink the situation. It is not a question of the Opposition taking political credit. It is simply a matter of doing what is right. There are several imaginative alternatives to this scheme, some of which were mentioned earlier. I could mention the part-time jobs opportunities put forward every year in conjunction with the budget by Social Justice Ireland. Those are innovative, useful, socially responsible employment opportunity schemes but I did not believe I would live long enough or be a Member of this House long enough to see the Labour Party supporting this scheme.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	435	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Gateway so-called local authority labour activation scheme. It should be called the local authority slave labour scheme. It amazes me that somebody in the Department sat down and came up with that. To insult unemployed people by forcing them to take up a so-called job with a local authority, which is supposed to be an activation scheme, for €1 an hour on top of their social welfare payment is a disgrace. The type of work identified within the local authorities includes village enhancement schemes, landscaping, tourism ambassadors, control of animals, and libraries yet there is no training or education value in that. What does an unemployed person who is unfortunate enough to be selected for one of these schemes and takes it up get out of it? They get €20 a week for 22 months for participating in this scheme. This Government should lift the embargo on local authorities to allow them employ staff. In my town of Killybegs the library closed two years ago because the librarian retired and the council could not replace her because of the embargo. The library services were withdrawn from the community because of this embargo operated by the Government. How can somebody be put to work in a library without training them in how to do the job, which would ensure they get value out of it? There is no training or education budget as part of this scheme. An unemployed person came into my office last week and the first question they asked was why the only jobs advertised in Donegal are community employment, CE, schemes or internships. That is a good question, and it shows that this Government's jobs policy is defunct in terms of rural areas when all that unemployed people can look for is a CE scheme or an internship. They now have the added advantage of considering the Gateway scheme also. This is the type of meaningless employment activation scheme to which this Government is reduced. The only reason it can be introducing it is to massage the figures on the live register. Much was made of the fact that the live register figures have dropped below 12% in recent weeks but there are over 85,000 people on so-called labour activation schemes who are not included in the live register figures. People are in internships or on Gateway schemes for no pay. They are still unemployed people and they should be included in the figures.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	436	It is interesting to those of us on this side of the House, particularly many of the Independents, Sinn Féin and, one would have thought, the Labour Party, that if one was watching television at home and the Conservative Party in England or Margaret Thatcher if she were still alive came up with this idea one would be aghast, as are many people. I am aware from speaking to some people on unemployment benefit, and there are many in Waterford, which has one of the highest rates, that they find it offensive, humiliating and soul destroying. It is offensive and humiliating because this is the best the Government can offer people who are unemployed. This is what it is offering to young people who might have left school with qualifications but who, through no fault of their own, cannot go any further or get a sustainable job. The Government is offering them €1 an hour. It is outrageous. Deputy O'Dea is correct. I cannot understand how anyone in the Labour Party would support this measure. The Government is telling people they must work for €1 an hour. If we heard of that happening in India or South America every Member in this House would be outraged. It is camouflaging statistics. All of these people will be taken off the live register. Someone from Fine Gael made an appalling statement last week to the effect that it was creating 300 jobs a week. Are these the 300 jobs a week that it is creating? The problem is that the Government is not fooling anyone. It is not fooling the unemployed, the media or the people who will have to take up these jobs. It is fooling itself, and all the statistics and the opinion polls are showing that people no longer believe the Government. All this guff about how the Government will deal with unemployment, treat people with dignity and create sustainable jobs means nothing when it comes up with harebrained schemes such as this one. My hope is that those people in that scheme will join a union, go on strike and bring it down around itself.

In terms of the value of the underlying loan, I would remind the Deputy that NAMA is subject to similar legal requirements as other lenders that preclude it from disclosing financial details relating to its debtors.

However, the Revenue Commissioners do also have access to the pay and tax details as submitted by the employer in the annual P35 return. In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, I am advised that the pay and tax P35 details for 2002 to 2004 are readily available to Revenue and these have now been issued to the person concerned.  Regarding the years prior to 2002, these details have been archived. To facilitate the speedy retrieval of the details for the earlier archived years, Revenue have written to the person concerned requesting details of the person's employment(s) for each of these earlier years.

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying FÁS and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided.  The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. In addition, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of €1,650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of €4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and
increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.
 To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting. The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions. In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than €10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge. This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid. I have no plans to introduce any further tax reliefs for childcare costs. As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. As the Deputy will also appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-03-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	440	€3,174 is the amount of other income which a taxpayer, whose main source of income is taxable through the PAYE system, can earn, in certain circumstances, before becoming a chargeable person. In this regard, the Deputy's question appears to relate to an individual aged under 66 whose main source of income is from employment that is taxable through the PAYE system, who does not have income from a trade or profession and who is not, therefore, in the self-assessment system, but who is going to exceed the threshold of €3,174 in relation to income from investments for the first time and on a once-off basis.    In this situation, there is no liability to PRSI if the income from investments was earned in the tax year 2013.  As regards 2014, the individual will be liable to PRSI on this income and he or she must, therefore, pay and file for 2014 and 2015 under the self-assessment system even if the income earned from investments falls back below the threshold in 2015 because it was earned on a once-off basis.  However, he or she will not have to pay and file as a self-assessed individual for 2016 if the income from investments remains below €3,174 for 2016 and the individual's original income status is resumed.   In order to pay and file for 2014 and 2015, the individual must register as a self-assessed taxpayer and meet the various payment obligations associated with being a self-assessed taxpayer.  These obligations are set out on the Revenue website at http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/self-assessment.html. It should be noted however, that if the individual is aged 66 or over, he or she is not insurable, and therefore has no liability to PRSI.

The Merc Partners survey gives an insight into some of the reasons =some private sector executives would not be interested in applying for positions on State Boards. It is the Government's task to change these negative views and to highlight the benefits that come from having suitably qualified people serving on State Boards. It is also the Government's policy to encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for positions on State Boards.

It is important to note that schools themselves employ teachers and not the Department of Education and Skills. However my Department has issued a number of circulars addressing this issue in recent years. Under these circulars school principals must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have to engage a registered teacher who is retired. Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people. A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale. Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable. This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching. The first point of the teacher's salary scale represents the lowest point or starting salary for teachers. Thus it was decided that retired teachers would be placed at that point of the scale. I will arrange to compile the information regarding the numbers currently working and forward directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.

This Memorandum of Understanding fosters increased levels of cooperation and formalises the Local Authorities' part in identifying and securing sites for educational use. In that context, my Department is working in conjunction with Cork County Council towards securing a permanent site to meet the needs of the school to which the Deputy refers. Whilst I can advise the Deputy that options are under consideration, due to the sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally I am not in a position to provide further information at this time. Once the acquisition of a site is finalised, it is envisaged that a design team will be appointed and the project will be progressed towards tender and construction stage.

The nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2013. In all cases, to qualify for a student grant, it is the grant applicant, and not his/her parents, that must meet the nationality or prescribed immigration status requirements in their own right. The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as proof of their nationality or immigration status to the relevant grant awarding authority. Article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2013 provides for the review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of changes of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status. This means that where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation, or is granted permission to remain provided for in the Act or Regulations during the course of their studies, he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed.

There are two Gaelscoileanna in the Lucan feeder area. While Palmerstown does not currently have a Gaelscoil, it is open to pupils from Palmerstown to apply for places in the Lucan gaelscoileanna. The total enrolment in the schools was 787 in 2011-12 and 882 in 2012-13. The number of pupils enrolled in individual schools is provided in the National School Annual Census. Results from the Census for the current school year, 2013-14, are being finalised at present. Publication of all data at primary level and a final list of schools and their enrolments will be on my Department's website by the end of the school year. My Department is currently analysing demographic data across the country, including that for the Lucan and Palmerstown feeder areas, to ensure any additional demand for places can be met in a timely manner. In the intervening period, it is, of course, open to schools themselves to apply for funding for additional accommodation where they consider this is warranted. Earlier this year, one of the schools was approved funding for an extra classroom. I understand that there are no further applications on hands for capital funding from the schools.

This is in addition to the existing 16-classroom Gaelscoil in Lucan. As the Deputy is aware, my Department's over-riding objective is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. This must remain our priority. However, my Department will continue to provide improved accommodation in our schools within the funding available. In the case of schools with purchased prefab accommodation, which is in urgent need of repair, it is open to such schools to utilise their capitation grants or minor works grant in the case of primary schools to undertake such repairs. Where prefabs have significant structural issues, it is open to the schools to submit an application to my Department for the replacement of such prefabs and each application will be considered on a case by case basis within the funding available. My Department would request that a technical report and supporting evidence relating to the condition of the prefabs and outlining the works required should accompany any submission. Due to constraints on available funding imposed by the need to provide additional accommodation to meet demographic growth, my Department will deal with applications from schools for devolved funding for the replacement of purchased prefabs on a case by case basis in the context of available funding and the immediate accommodation needs of the school.

The factors include, but would not be limited to, the number of applications, the number of students directly transitioning from second level to third level, the number of mature students entering the system for the first time or re-entering after a break in study, the increases in population in a particular age–cohort, or area be it rural or urban, the economic circumstances and developments in a particular area, the financial circumstances of individuals and their parents and the increases in attendance at third level generally.  In the 2012-13 academic year new applicants applied to Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) and renewal applicants remained with their previous grant awarding authorities (Mayo County Council and Co. Mayo VEC in this instance). The table details the number of awards (new and renewal) in Mayo for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 academic year. Mayo2011/122012/13% ChangeNew1,6151,679+4%Renewal2,2121,783-19%Total3,8273,827 -9.5%The above shows that while there was an overall decrease of some 9.5% in total awards in Mayo in 2012-13, the number of new awards made by SUSI actually represents an increase from 2011-12 of some 4%. The creation of SUSI, a single grant awarding agency, and the electronic compilation of data will enable greater visibility and analysis of trends in this area in coming years.
