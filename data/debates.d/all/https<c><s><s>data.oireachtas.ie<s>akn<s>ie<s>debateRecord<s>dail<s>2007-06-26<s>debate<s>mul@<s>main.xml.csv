#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.The period since the dissolution of the 29th Dáil has seen tremendous progress in Northern Ireland, with the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive and the appointment of Dr. Ian Paisley and Mr. Martin McGuinness to the positions of First Minister and Deputy First Minister, respectively.  The North-South Ministerial Council and the North-South bodies have also been restored to full operation.I expect the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in plenary session to take place shortly in Armagh, with the next summit meeting of the British-Irish Council also to take place shortly in Belfast.  Final arrangements for the two meetings are currently being made.I have met Prime Minister Blair on several occasions recently.  On 8 May, we met in Belfast, when we attended the restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland.  We met again on 15 May in London, when I addressed the joint Houses of Parliament in Westminster.  We also met on the margins of the European Council in Brussels last week.Prime Minister Blair is leaving office tomorrow.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him for his immense contribution to the improvement in relations between Ireland and Britain and his historic role in helping bring peace to this island.  He has earned the eternal gratitude of the Irish people and, I am sure, of all sides of the House for that work.I have not yet made any formal arrangements to meet his successor, Mr. Gordon Brown.  I extend my best wishes to the new Prime Minister as he takes office and look forward to maintaining and improving the excellent relationship that now exists between our two countries.On 15 May, I had the honour of addressing the joint Houses of Parliament in Westminster.  In my address, I spoke about the significance of putting the past behind us and laying the foundation for the future.  I emphasised the importance of moving forward and building on the new partnership between Ireland and Britain.  I offered the view that this was not only a partnership of peace but also other common interests — of people, culture, business and sport.I met Dr. Ian Paisley on a number of occasions recently.  We had a very businesslike and friendly discussion on a range of matters of mutual interest at Farmleigh on 4 April.  The meeting represented a very significant demonstration of how the relationship between our two traditions has developed.  On 8 May, I met Dr. Paisley with Mr. Martin McGuinness in Stormont for the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and their appointment as First and Deputy First Minister.  I then met the First Minister on 11 May at the Battle of the Boyne site.  The event was also attended by representatives of both traditions on this island and public representatives from North and South.Prior to the restoration of the institutions, I met Dawn Purvis, MLA, the leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, on 24 April.  It was my first opportunity to discuss the situation with Ms Purvis since her appointment as leader.  I reiterated my determination that the peace process should leave no one behind and my hope that loyalism would now move on.  I welcomed the subsequent statement by the UVF that all its active units have been deactivated, all weapons have been put beyond reach and that targeting has ceased.  I also made clear the need to see progress on the issues of criminality and decommissioning.There have been suggestions in the past that we reconvene the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, or a similar body, so that it can focus on reconciliation and the plight of victims on all sides.  The question of dealing with the past is crucial and requires our ongoing attention.  I am open as to the best means of making progress.  I welcome the establishment of the independent consultative group to be jointly chaired by Archbishop Robin Eames and Denis Bradley.  While our focus must be on building a better future for this island, it is right that we think again about how we try to address the human legacy of an appalling conflict.Looking to the future, the Government will continue to maintain close contacts at different levels with the British Government, with the Northern Ireland Executive, with the political parties and civil society in Northern Ireland.  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with officials from Office of the First and Deputy First Minister through official channels.  Several meetings have been held since the restoration of the Executive and these contacts will continue.  There are also formal procedures in place for liaison on the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.We will also continue to work closely with the US Administration.  I was very glad to meet a high level delegation from the United States, led by Senator Edward Kennedy and Special Envoy Paula Dobriansky, in Stormont on 8 May.  I expressed my continuing gratitude for the US contribution to the peace process.  The special envoy has since had a number of meetings with officials to discuss the future US contribution, which I expect to be mainly in the economic arena.  I have no formal plans to visit the United States this year, although it is possible I will visit there in September on UN business.I normally meet the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board during my visit to the United States for St. Patrick's Day and I expect there will be a further meeting on that occasion next year.  The Government maintains ongoing contact with the board, primarily through the embassy in Washington.

Has the Taoiseach raised the issue of total demilitarisation with the outgoing British Prime Minister?  Has he immediate plans to address this issue with the new Prime Minister taking up office tomorrow?Will the Taoiseach raise as a matter of urgency the decision announced yesterday by the Public Prosecution Service in the Six Counties not to press charges against any British soldier or RUC officer for the murder of Pat Finucane with the new British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown?  Given that decision, what renewed efforts do the Taoiseach and his Government propose to take to see the establishment of the international independent public inquiry which has been sought by the Finucane family and which was, as he will recall, unanimously backed by all parties and Members in this House during the last Dáil?  Does he agree that the refusal of the British Government to act on this issue is most likely out of the desire to protect named individuals and others unknown, including Brigadier Gordon Kerr, the former head of the force research unit which ran the loyalist paramilitary agents who is now a senior British army officer serving in Iraq?  Does the Taoiseach share the strongly held view that the British Government's refusal to act in line with the Finucane family's demand is in order to protect Brigadier Kerr and out of fear of the information he might disclose if subjected to scrutiny and questioning on collusion during his years serving in the North of Ireland?The Taoiseach referred to the all-Ireland ministerial council.  When does he expect the first meeting of the council will take place?  Will the Taoiseach initiate in the new Dáil a report-back procedure to provide Members with an opportunity to participate in and ask questions about the workings of the council?  Does the Taoiseach agree it is extremely important that the House recognises the importance of the all-Ireland ministerial council?  As the elected voices of the people in this part of Ireland, Members should have the opportunity to be fully apprised of the council's work and make direct contributions to assist it in the conduct of its business and to help it reach its full potential as an all-Ireland council of Ministers.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Like the Ceann Comhairle, I am glad to see that Deputy Ó Caoláin is well.On the closure of Bessbrook, the demilitarisation process continues and I am very pleased to see this.  On Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, demilitarisation is raised on an almost daily basis by either myself, more often the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, or officials.  It is a weekly if not almost a daily item of business and will continue to be.  It has especially been the case throughout the year as we have moved towards normalisation that the issue has been raised daily in respect of various bases and infrastructural projects we wish to see dismantled and moved on.  We note the significant and continual progress that is being made and will continue to emphasise that.It is disappointing that the Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland has found there is insufficient evidence at this time for further prosecutions arising out of the third Stevens report on collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces.  It is a disappointing development not least, as Deputy Ó Caoláin said, for the Finucane family.  The finding does not alter the need for an independent inquiry and to allay any other concerns surrounding this case as I documented here during the life of the last Dáil time out of number.  That will continue to be our stated position.  It is the Government's view that the finding adds to the case for an independent inquiry.  It is the attitude we will persist with.  The House passed a very clear motion in support of the Finucane family in the last Dáil and called for a full, independent judicial inquiry.  I am sure that is also the view of this Dáil.  It has been a long-standing position of the Government and remains so.  We remain in touch with the Finucane family and will continue to offer our full support in every way at home and abroad, especially in the USA and Europe.We are at the final stage of preparations for the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  While the North-South Ministerial Council and the intergovernmental British Irish Council meetings will take place close in time to each other, it has not yet been possible due to the change of Prime Minister in the UK to tie down dates for the latter.  We hope to do so shortly and to be in a position to move on both dates.  The hope that the new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, would attend the BIC has been the reason for waiting for a sign-off date.We are ready and the agenda and work of Ministers across Departments has been finalised on our side and is fairly close to finalisation on the Executive side.  It is hoped the meeting will take place as soon as possible.With regard to reporting on it, I have no difficulty with what Deputy Ó Caoláin stated.  Obviously, during questions on Northern Ireland here, I will give a report from my perspective as I used to do previously when it met.  It will also involve detailed work by most Departments so the relevant Minister should also answer in his or her area.  The preparatory work has been done and there is an enormous, exciting and dynamic agenda across Departments.  It is necessary and important that it is debated here and that colleagues answer questions here on the progress which takes place between them and the Executive on an ongoing basis.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Taoiseach will recall that, following a proposal put forward by the Fine Gael Party last year, the House unanimously supported the call for a public inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane.  His family live on and a grave injustice was done.  Judge Cory recommended that a full-scale public inquiry should take place.  Does the Taoiseach accept he failed to convince Prime Minister Tony Blair of the need for a public inquiry in this case where a glaring injustice must be rectified?In accepting this failure to convince Prime Minister Blair, will the Taoiseach tell the House that he will take it up as a priority with his successor, Prime Minister-elect Gordon Brown, to be appointed tomorrow?  The proposal was unanimously supported in this House by all parties and none.  This is a glaring injustice in the background to the Northern Ireland Troubles, which have evolved to the peace we have today.In the context of the North-South Ministerial Council, what is the status of the Taoiseach's proposal to allow Seanad speaking rights to Northern Ireland representatives in view of the fact an all-party Oireachtas committee will deal with this issue?  When does the Taoiseach expect the council to commence its first meeting?  Is the Taoiseach's Seanad speaking rights proposal now withdrawn?According to Queen's University, Belfast, young boys and men appear to be far more prone to suffering the effects and after-effects of sectarianism in Northern Ireland.  What efforts is the Government making to support combatting sectarianism and dealing with its consequences?  A group was established to examine the legacy of the Troubles in terms of its social effects on young men and women and the population in general and former Primate Robin Eames, Denis Bradley and others were extremely vocal on this issue.  What is the Government's view in this regard?At the Taoiseach's recent meeting with Archbishop Tutu of South Africa, the possibility of a peace and reconciliation forum was discussed at some length.  Is this a runner or will it supersede the forum dealing with the legacy of the Troubles?The corporation tax rate is an incentive for this country and has been for a long time.  Big and small business and business interest groups throughout the country have suggested an equalisation of corporation tax rates North and South to build an Ireland economic entity of which the Taoiseach spoke and which we all support.  Has the Taoiseach put any initial proposals to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and will he raise this matter with him when he becomes Prime Minister tomorrow?  The Northern Ireland economy is referred to as a "basket case" during the doling out of the grant from the British Government every year.  If the island is to become attractive economically, surely this should be of critical importance to the incoming British Prime Minister.  Has the Taoiseach raised that issue and will he ensure it is a priority when he next meets with the British Prime Minister?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	5	In regard to the first question, the British Government's position is not that it will not offer an inquiry.  It has offered us an inquiry and amended the legislation on the Finucane case but the family, the Government and others rejected the form of that legislation.  We do not accept the kind of inquiry the British Government has offered — it is its right to offer it.  The British Government gave way to us on the basis of an inquiry but in our view that inquiry, under that legislation, would not be full and open and would allow for protecting people in a way that would get to the truth.  It is not that the British Government did not offer an inquiry.  It went further than that and changed the legislation and offered the resources and the staff.  That inquiry is not one that we believe is open and satisfactory.  The British Government's position is that it will go no further under its jurisdiction than that type of inquiry.  There rests the issue.  Our ongoing campaign has argued for a full transparent inquiry that will bring the people who were involved in this case to heal in a way the family and all those who campaigned for it want.On the issue of sectarianism, it was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who met Archbishop Tutu.  Previously I had looked closely at the South African model.  The Deputy will remember some years ago when we had the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation we looked very closely at how that would or might work.  There was not a great interest in or take-up of that by the parties or other groups in Northern Ireland but that does not change the need for us, as set out in the programme for Government and many of the programmes under the Department of Foreign Affairs, to try to help in every way possible in projects, examinations, pilot surveys, cross-Border initiatives and education promotions to deal with the issue of sectarianism in a way that can ease the tensions and particularly in the areas where sectarianism is rife.  I acknowledge the enormous amount of good work being done by universities, education institutes, cultural bodies, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and many other bodies.  In the programme for Government there is provision for the continuation of this work and the setting up of a fund to assist in this area.In regard to the North-South bodies we are ready to have those meetings but are waiting for finalisation of the date, which is held up because of the change in the UK this week but, hopefully, it will be cleared.  There is a provision whereby the North-South Ministerial Council will be held fairly close to the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  Obviously we hope the British Prime Minister will attend, at least on this occasion.  It is not a question that the British Prime Minister always attended or that I always attended, but it is a matter of attending the first meeting.On corporation tax, last year I worked with the groups in the North to put that case.  We had done much to assist and press that issue.  I worked with Dr. Quigley and many of the other business leaders to put forward a case.  Out of that the British Government initiated a review by Sir David Varney to examine the issue of corporation tax reform in Northern Ireland.  They did not pin themselves down as to what they would do.  Officials have been assisting Sir David and have been in consultation with colleagues in Belfast.  We support the proposal, although, of course, we understand that it creates a range of issues in the UK context.  Alex Salmond, when he was in Northern Ireland recently, also highlighted the issues for Scotland and a number of people in Wales have done so as well.Some in Northern Ireland, including some eminent economists, who obviously would be of the Unionist tradition, would argue very strongly that this is not in the interest of Northern Ireland.  They would resist the Deputy's comment that their economy is a basket case.  They do not accept that the level of public sector involvement is dangerous.  I agree with the Deputy, I think it is.  There are a number of fundamental problems and difficulties but they fairly trenchantly resist this analysis by us.  I obviously respect their position, but those who have argued for more private sector involvement, more capital into Northern Ireland and more inward investment are on the right side of what seems to be the logical economic argument for the future.  It was on that basis — we have said this for several years — that we were in favour of moving to an all-island economy in a whole range of areas, the corporation tax issue being one.  There are many other initiatives, fiscal initiatives and others, that were raised, at least in a preliminary way, with the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, when he was in Belfast.  These are initiatives on which we should follow through.I do not think this will be an easy case.  Obviously the man who tomorrow will become British Prime Minister, Mr. Brown, will be very familiar with the arguments of the Treasury.  Most, but not all, senior business people in the North would agree that there is a substantive case at least to examine.  I hope that the work Sir David does takes that into account.  We will give our input into that.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that he does not believe that the South African-style truth and reconciliation commission would be the appropriate one for Northern Ireland?  Have the British authorities consulted him or the Government about the remit, personnel, timeframe etc. of the independent group announced to examine the legacy of the Troubles?  If the Taoiseach's view is that the South African model is not the appropriate one, does the Government have views on what the appropriate model might be and will that be exchanged with the British Government?The Taoiseach said that the North-South Ministerial Council is likely to be convened at an early date to meet in Armagh.  Does that mean there will be regular meetings between him and the First Minister?  Is such a meeting planned?  In that regard what is the status of the Government proposition made during the last Dáil for an Oireachtas committee on North-South co-operation?  Does he agree that no steps ought to be taken that would destabilise the institutions in Northern Ireland?  Does he agree that priority ought to be given to the North-South parliamentary forum as envisaged in the Belfast Agreement?In respect of the assassination of Pat Finucane, was he surprised at the decision of the prosecutorial service in this regard, having regard to the clear conclusions of the Stevens inquiry that there was collusion between security services and paramilitaries in Northern Ireland?  Will he raise with the new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, the imperative of a truly independent and proper inquiry into that murder?Does the Taoiseach agree it is an irony that, as we approach a peaceful marching season in Northern Ireland, which we all hope will continue through 12 July and thereafter, there is in prospect a potentially contentious parade in Dublin by the Love Ulster organisation?  The parade on the last occasion had unfortunate consequences.  What is the Government's view on that?  Is there contact between the organisers of the parade and agents of the Government?  Does the Taoiseach think it will or it ought to go ahead?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	7	A truth commission was discussed more than ten years ago in Dublin Castle and at that stage we had examined the South African situation.  There was not an appetite for a commission then or since during various discussions with representatives of political parties and other non-political organisations who would have been able to assist in making it workable.  The reason it was a success in South Africa is people were prepared to come forward and follow through on incidents by bringing the various victims, witnesses and others to the table.  I pressed for a commission at that time and on several occasions since, on the basis that more and more individuals, families, organisations and communities have come forward to try to find out the truth about what happened in the circumstances where after the atrocity or killing and other incidents that occurred during the 28 years of the Troubles there was very little investigation.  As I have stated previously in the House, the groups and families involved paint the picture of these events honestly and truthfully as if they happened yesterday.  This does not go away and it makes things very difficult for them.  I have always seen merit in having a way in which they can register formally their feelings other than approaching me, a Minister or a British Minister.  While this would not resolve their problems and give them closure, it would at least give them some satisfaction.  That is all many of the families need and there is merit in establishing some mechanism.  The South African mechanism is the best and no other mechanism has been as wide, broad and successful as it.  The British Government consulted us on the group that was announced and its format and we will co-operate on that.  The two people, Denis Bradley and Reverend Eames, have been involved in different ways in the peace process and the Troubles for many years and they are very much aware of what I have outlined.  It is worth having a look at what we can do on this.While we have had several inquiries, including the Cory inquiry, and there was much engagement between the Government and many of the families and groups, the historical inquiries team within the PSNI is examining the cases and significant resources have been invested in its work.  These initiatives have been very useful but very many of the families still need help.  I have only met a fraction of the large number of families requiring some process to be put in place.  This group, which will look back on the issue, will consider what we can do and engage everyone in the process.It is a useful and worthwhile exercise, and I very much appreciate that Prime Minister Blair initiated this before he left office.  We had made the case time and again that some process had to be put in place, and it is an area he understood very well.  I hope we can take it forward from that position.We are ready to move on the North-South Ministerial Council and I will not repeat myself on it.  As the Deputy stated, I proposed in the previous Dáil to establish a joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and allow Northern Ireland MLAs attend on a similar basis as MEPs on the committee for European affairs.  We did not reach all-party agreement on that but we are clearly in a far more positive environment now.The question of a North-South parliamentary forum is contained in the St. Andrews Agreement, and that is more realistic now the Northern Ireland Assembly has been restored.  However, I understand there may be mixed views in the Northern parties on the issues.  I will consult with my Government colleagues and Opposition leaders on how we might progress from here.On the proposed Love Ulster parade, I am aware there has been ongoing contact between the Garda Síochána and Families Acting for Innocent Relatives, FAIR.  Although discussions are at a very early stage and no decisions have been made, the group has put its points of view and the Garda has explained its position.  As a general rule, the Garda tries to facilitate orderly demonstrations while minimising disruption to ordinary people going about their business.  Public safety and the protection of lives and property must be a priority.  Contact between the Garda and FAIR will continue.  I do not want to prejudice the issue, as the Garda has explored the issue and given its views, as well as its opinion on what happened before.  We should all reflect on whether a march along the lines of the previous march is the most appropriate way to remember victims.If the purpose is to remember victims, we should keep that issue in focus and consider the most appropriate way to do this.  The events surrounding the last march did not do much to help that cause.  It may also be an issue elected representatives North and South would have views on in the wider context of our improving relationships.  It is very early on and my information from the Garda Síochána is that it saw the meeting as a preliminary stage.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Has the Taoiseach been invited to address the Northern Ireland Assembly?  Is it his intention to invite the First Minister to possibly address Seanad Éireann, in view of regulations for the Houses regarding a head of government addressing the Dáil?Is the Taoiseach aware of the organised crime task force report from Northern Ireland in which Mr. Paul Goggins, a minister in the Northern Ireland Office, calls for public support from both governments in the fight against organised crime?  In it he makes the point that oils fraud across the border is the equivalent of approximately £280 million.  He also indicates that there are clearly fraudulent activities going on with at least 50 different denominations of bank notes in circulation.In the report, he goes on to indicate that the big threat in future will be armed threats to cash in transit, drugs, excise and tax frauds, extortion, blackmail and intimidation.  In view of that litany of serious crime, has the Taoiseach spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about co-operating with the Northern Ireland authorities in attempting to deal with these serious areas of economic fraud?Is there any update on the ongoing investigation into the Northern Bank raid?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	9	In regard to addressing the Assembly, Deputy Rabbitte asked if we would have a meeting.  We will have a meeting around the North-South Ministerial Council meeting but we have no formal arrangements yet.  I am very anxious to get the institutions up and running fully first before we do anything else.  It is important that the provisions of the Agreements, the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement, are fully operational.  Then we can consider other matters, but for the remainder of this year the focus will be very much on getting all the institutions to not only hold their formal meetings but arrange the agendas.I should have said earlier that in our preparatory work for the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council we have a work programme through to the remainder of the year across Departments, agencies and areas of ministerial responsibilities.On the issue of organised crime, Deputy Kenny will be aware that as we have seen the end of organised paramilitary activity in some areas, we have seen an increase in other criminal activity, as we have in every normalised society in the world.  This has created its own problems and difficulties.There is ongoing co-operation between the agencies here and close co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI, and that will continue where necessary.  It is a daily issue.  I do not believe there is any need to do anything new in that respect.  It is a matter of tackling those individuals who are involved in criminal activity.  Much of this problem, as in most other parts of Europe, relates to drug activities.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I do not want to invite the Taoiseach to comment further than is prudent on the question of the proposed Love Ulster demonstration, but on the discussions on the North-South institutions, is he saying that the proposal of the last Dáil in respect of an Oireachtas all-party committee is now withdrawn in favour of establishing the North-South Parliamentary Forum that is provided for in the Good Friday Agreement?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	11	As I said, the question of the North-South Parliamentary Forum is contained in the St. Andrews Agreement.  With the Assembly restored, it would seem more realistic to get that up and running.  I will again consult the party leaders on how we might make progress on that.  Some of the difficulties we had in the past should now be removed and the North-South Parliamentary Forum will allow us to move on.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	12	On the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, we saw the 33rd anniversary recorded at the height of the general election campaign, a week before polling day.  In light of the MacEntee report and the further deliberations of the Oireachtas sub-committee, has the Taoiseach moved forward in any way towards the central demand of Justice for the Forgotten, representative of the victims and the survivors of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 17 May 1974?  Where does he stand now in regard to its call for a full, cross-Border preferably, cross-jurisdictional public independent inquiry?  Will he advise where he stands on that matter and how he intends to progress towards that requirement?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Separate questions are tabled on the MacEntee commission report and I will deal with that issue then because there is extensive detail on that and on the follow-up on the other Barron inquiries.  I would prefer to take those questions at that stage.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Exchequer tax receipts to the end of May were, at €18.603 million, just €19 million or 0.1% below profile.  They were 9.6% up on the same period last year.  This compares with a budget day target of an increase of 7.8% for 2007 as a whole.While overall tax receipts were almost exactly on target at the end of May, there are some variations under particular tax heads: corporation tax receipts are €221 million or 17.5% above profile; customs receipts are €4 million or 3.6% above profile; VAT receipts were €28 million or 0.4% below profile; income tax receipts are €56 million or 1.1% below profile; excise duties were €120 million or 4.7% below profile; stamp duties were €16 million or 1.1% below profile; and capital taxes were €71 million or 5.8% below profile.  Of these, capital gains tax was €79 million or 7.2% below profile and capital acquisitions tax was €8 million or 5.1% above profile.Given the significance of tax payments in the latter part of the year, it would be unwise to attempt to draw conclusions about the performance of the economy based on tax receipts at this early stage.  The latest available economic estimates show that the economy continues to perform well.  Preliminary CSO data for 2006 as a whole indicates that GDP growth was 6%, while, in GNP terms, the growth rate in 2006 was estimated at 7.4%.In the circumstances, I do not see a need to revise our forecast at this stage.  However, my Department monitors tax receipts on an ongoing basis and, as more data become available, any significant changes to the expected end of year receipts will be signalled once the position becomes clear.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Is the Tánaiste aware that the data relating to housing starts suggest that they are 30% down on their peak?  Commentators for Davy have indicated that this could lead to housing completions falling from 95,000 to 65,000.  Do I infer from the Tánaiste's reply that he sees such a fall-off in housing activity as having no impact on tax revenue?  Has he considered the likely impact of such a fall in housing construction on employment in the sector?  Davy suggests that as many as 28,000 jobs could be lost in the construction sector as a result of the decline in activity.  Does the Tánaiste believe that Exchequer revenue will be immune to this decline or is he of the view that the data relating to housing starts are wrong?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Housing market activity impacts primarily on VAT, stamp duty and capital gains tax.  It also impacts on income tax and PRSI receipts and corporation tax from construction sector company profits.  While revenue from housing market activity, such as that relating to stamp duty and capital gains tax, has made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, we are not overly reliant on receipts from this source.  Taken together, for example, the stamp duty and capital gains tax heads are forecast to contribute approximately 15% of total targeted tax revenues in 2007.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I did not inquire about that matter.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	18	It is worth noting that a significant proportion of receipts from these tax heads comes from sources other than residential property.On housing starts, a correction has been taking place in the market since last autumn.  This has resulted in an easing in house price inflation.  The latter is a welcome development because continuing double digit house price inflation would not be sustainable.  There is also the question of trying to ensure that we achieve a soft landing for the housing sector, particularly in view of the fact that the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, the ESRI and others forecast over a period that there would be a reduction in housing starts and completions to a level of approximately 65,000 to 70,000 per annum in the next few years.We need to ensure there is stability and certainty in the market.  That is one of the reasons we have decided to bring legislative proposals before the House this evening.  We want to maintain confidence in the housing market.  The question before the House relates to the impact on revenues.  At this stage, we do not think there is any reason to believe we will be below profile in our overall tax receipts, under all the tax heads.  We will continue to monitor the situation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Tánaiste has not answered the questions I asked.  He devoted most of his time to answering questions which were not those I asked.  Davy, which is not regarded as reckless, has indicated that tax receipts in 2008 will decrease by €1.3 billion on the basis of the existing figures for housing.  Does the Minister intend to stick his head in the sand, like an ostrich, by pretending that is not happening, or will he try to anticipate the impact of the predicted decline on public financial planning?  That is the question I would like him to answer.  He seems to be pretending that it would be unwise at this stage to anticipate such a fall.  That suggests that he believes such a reduction will not happen, or that he believes such a reduction will have no impact.  There is no sound basis for either belief.  How will the Minister cope with the likely decline in revenue of over €1 billion in 2008?  What impact will such a decline have?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	20	In the past, returns in this area have exceeded those which had been forecast.  Such forecasts were not based on windfall gains.  There continues to be a prospect that our estimates will come in on target, even if there is a downturn.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	21	On budget day, 6 December 2006, the Department of Finance forecast that consumer price index inflation would be 4.1% this year.  That forecast was based on the normal technical assumption of unchanged interest rates.  The budget day forecast for the harmonised index of consumer prices inflation — the EU inflation measure — was 2.6% this year.  As usual, the Department will publish updated inflation forecasts in the pre-budget outlook, which is due in the autumn.  There have been three interest rate increases of 0.25% since budget day, the latest of which was earlier this month.  CPI inflation has averaged 5%, year-on-year, in the first five months of this year, during which two of the three increases took place.  As interest rates are a matter for the governing council of the European Central Bank, they are outside the control of the Government.Mortgage interest accounts for approximately half of Ireland's rate of inflation.  If the effect of mortgage interest is excluded, the year-on-year CPI average is 2.6% so far this year.  The CPI excluding tobacco has averaged 0.2% lower than the full CPI so far this year.  If one maintains the normal assumption that there will be no further interest rate increases, the rate of inflation is expected to moderate as the year continues.  The EU comparable measure of inflation — the harmonised index of consumer prices — is the best measure of underlying inflation.  It is used by the ECB because it removes the effect of interest rate increases which are made to reduce inflationary pressures.  Therefore, it is important that we do not seek to compensate ourselves for such rises in interest rates, as that would lead to a wage inflation spiral and would reduce our competitiveness and, ultimately, our real standard of living.On foot of a statement made by the Taoiseach on 7 June last, it is planned that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I will meet representatives of IBEC and ICTU this week to discuss how we can tackle inflationary pressures together in line with our shared commitments.  Where possible, we will take action to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies.  Indirect taxes, with the exception of tobacco excise which I increased for sound health reasons, were not raised in the last three budgets I brought before the House.  The decision of the last Government to abolish the groceries order is helping to reduce food price inflation.  The stable macroeconomic environment created by the last two Governments through the pursuit of sound public finances, which this Government fully intends to continue, will help the economy to remain competitive and will provide the basis for achieving further economic and social policy objectives in the long term.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	22	What does the Minister have to say to families and people at work who are receiving very little in the way of wage increases?  Their wage increases are, to use the Minister's term, heavily moderated through the social partnership process, but they are living in an economy with an inflation rate of 5%.  For most workers and their families, the cost of living in Ireland, compared to most European countries, is astronomically high.  I accept what the Minister is saying, namely, that much of the rise in inflation is attributable to interest rate increases.  Nonetheless, many Irish people who go on holidays to other EU countries this summer — to get away from the rain — will marvel at the cost of a meal out or a basket of shopping in places like Spain or Greece and throughout the EU.  Even countries like Sweden which were once regarded as extraordinarily expensive are now good value when compared to the Republic of Ireland.What will the Government do under the programme for Government to bring down the rate of inflation?  Has the Minister any concrete proposals to tackle the rising cost of services?  Most of those price rises are driven by Government policy and the fact that in the housing market it is extremely difficult for young families to purchase an affordable home.  Leave aside the millionaires — we are simply talking about ordinary families who are trying to put a roof over their heads and service the cost of a mortgage in an economy which is now at the top of the inflation league.  What has the Minister to say about this and what is he going to do?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	23	In looking at the causes of Irish inflation over the past year, it is important to distinguish between external factors, which are beyond domestic policy control, and internal factors.  Externally, the main cause is higher mortgage interest payments due to ECB interest rate increases.  Excluding mortgage interest repayments, as I have said, the rate of increase in the CPI inflation rate last year would have been2.6%.  Mortgage interest is currently adding approximately 2.5% to inflation.There is no room for complacency in terms of internal factors.  As the Deputy said in respect of services inflation, this is a cause for concern.  We must continue to increase competition in that market.  This Government has committed itself to reviewing all of the regulatory environment in which we do business in this country to try to ensure that we provide the best prospect for a competitive situation in services.The goods inflation issue is not causing us much concern.  For example, when one looks at the impact of the abolition of the groceries order, one can see that those items which were subject to the groceries order increased by only 0.1% last year, while groceries items which were never covered by the order increased by 2.4% in 2006.  That, in addition to expanding the productive capacity of the country to improve our transport and other areas, are the medium and long-term issues under the national development plan, along with our investment in research and development and productivity increases.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Minister said that he, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will meet with, I understand, IBEC, the trade unions and the rest of the social partners to discuss inflation.  Is this a partnership Government?  Are any of Fianna Fáil's partners in Government — the Progressive Democrats or the Green Party — invited along to meet the social partners, including the trade unions and IBEC, or is this a Fianna Fáil solo run on inflation?
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	27	That question must be asked at another time.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Tax relief is provided at an individual's marginal income tax rate on amounts contributed to pension schemes, subject to limits.  Relief is also provided on contributions made by employers to such schemes and on the amount of profits and gains generated by the investments held by the pension schemes.  Pension benefits payable on retirement are taxable subject to an entitlement to take a tax-free lump-sum cash benefit.Over half of all people in employment are covered by voluntary private pensions and the tax relief arrangements described have assisted in this regard.  For people in employment aged between 30 and 65 years, the pension coverage level in the fourth quarter of 2005, according to the Central Statistics Office's quarterly national household survey, was approximately 62%.  This compares to a target of 70%, to be met sometime after 2013, suggested by the national pension policy initiative.The 2006 budget and Finance Act took steps to address some important equity issues and to limit the cost to the Exchequer of tax relief provided to higher income earners.  Among several commitments in the new programme for Government to improve pensions, there is a commitment to develop proposals, in the context of the Green Paper on pensions and in consultation with the social partners, to provide an SSIA-type scheme in an effort to make supplementary pension provision more attractive to those on low incomes.  This would further address pension adequacy and equity concerns and be negotiated under the aegis of the social partnership agreement.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Is the Minister aware that each year some well-placed individuals can receive a subsidy of €50,000 into their pensions from the taxpayer while under half of people in employment get nothing from the scheme?  Does this tally with the Minister's idea of fairness in a tax relief scheme?  It certainly does not tally with mine.During the course of the general election, proposals were made for a one-for-one pension scheme for those on low incomes.  Has financial provision been made in the programme for Government for the introduction of such a scheme?  During the course of the election, the Minister quickly withdrew that proposal when it was floated by the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.  If this scheme is to come from a Green Paper process, will it have to wait in a queue after all other tax code commitments have been met?  Will it be pushed to the end of the new programme for Government and only supported if there are enough resources left?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	34	During the general election, we stated we would give consideration to the introduction of an SSIA-type scheme that would have to be negotiated with the social partners.  In the absence of those negotiations, therefore, it is meaningless to outline the prospective costs of it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The then Minister for Social and Family Affairs outlined it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	36	During the election, as Minister for Finance, I clarified, without any equivocation, the issue.  It would be considered in the context of the cost of pensions in the tax system as pension relief schemes work.  There is considerable room for manoeuvre to see what changes can be made to pension arrangements that could accommodate, on a revenue-neutral basis, an SSIA-type scheme in the context of the full panoply of incentives available.  Taking into account the limited resources of low and middle income earners, there is a need to provide some other means of attracting them to supplementary pension provision beyond the tax incentive schemes available at the marginal rate.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Will the Government only introduce an SSIA-type scheme, which might offer some equity in pensions to people on low incomes, if savings can be found elsewhere?  Will this scheme be put to the back of the queue and only funded if savings are found in other Government programmes?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	38	It is not a question of being put to the back of any queue.  As proposed in the Green Paper, it is a question of examining the cost of pension provision and how the provision of further improved incentives would be taken up by people who do not regard current arrangements as sufficient for supplementary pension provision.  That is what I am talking about and ideally from the State's and the Minister's viewpoint, to do so on a revenue-neutral basis in the context of the significant billions already being spent in this area, should be the way forward.  However, this is subject to negotiation and discussion.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I confirm the Government's commitment to the decentralisation programme which has been included in the Agreed Programme for Government.  The Deputy will be aware that the decentralisation implementation group, DIG, was appointed to oversee the implementation of the programme.  It might be helpful to give a brief update on progress with the programme under a number of headings.To date, more than 10,600 people have applied to decentralise through the central applications facility, CAF, and despite consistent negative commentary, no political spokesperson has said that any town or county should be dropped from the programme.  Progress reports by the DIG are submitted to me on a regular basis.  The group reported in its last report, October 2006, that implementation of the decentralisation programme is progressing satisfactorily.  At the end of April 2007, more than 2,700 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts.  It is expected that more than 1,000 staff will be in place this summer in more than 20 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location as soon as accommodation is available.It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 33 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred.  The precise numbers moving within that timeframe will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit-out and installation of necessary information communications technology, ICT, and telecommunications cabling and equipment.  The property programme is well advanced.  The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis.Some 30 State agencies are due to relocate under the Government's decentralisation programme, with 2,340 posts involved, or just over 22% of the programme.  The DIG noted in its latest report that while progress has been made by some State agencies, there has been a marked lack of action in others.  The group has met with CEOs from a number of State agencies to get an overview of progress to date and to identify the challenges remaining in implementing the Government policy.The main issues facing the State agencies are those relating to the filling of posts in undersubscribed locations, the placing of staff choosing to remain in Dublin and promotion arrangements.  These issues are the subject of ongoing contacts between my Department and ICTU.  An approach based on negotiations and agreement has enabled significant progress to be made as regards the Civil Service moves and it is the intention to continue with this policy regarding the professional and technical grades in both the Civil Service and the State agency sector.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Does the Minister for Finance agree that it is both cynical and dishonest for Ministers who introduced this proposal to hide behind the implementation agency and pretend that all the difficulties being encountered in the movement of the various groups have nothing to do with them?  Is it not the case that there is no system for people who work within State agencies to move voluntarily from their organisations to any other?  Four years on from the introduction of this initiative Deputy Brian Cowen as Minister has not produced any proposals to deal with that.  As a consequence there are bodies such as Bord Fáilte where nobody has indicated a willingness to go, the National Roads Authority, where one person was willing to go and the Irish Aviation Authority where two people indicated they were willing to go.  There are many agencies such as FÁS, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the HSA and the Valuation Office Ireland, where tiny numbers are indicating a willingness to move.  There is an onus on the political masters who introduced this scheme to take responsibility and come up with proposals to deal with this issue.It is cynical and dishonest to continue the pretence that some independent group has responsibility for this, letting Ministers run away from it.  It has been an ill-conceived proposal and we need to have proper policy to implement a viable decentralisation programme rather than the type of carry-on we have seen.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The only people talking out of both sides of their mouths have been Members of the Opposition, depending on what bench they sit on and what Question Time is taking place on any given day.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	42	There is nothing cynical about a Member of the Opposition saying he or she would like to see decentralisation in the community, but we have nothing but a Government full of cynicism and dishonesty, which will not produce a strategy to do it.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	44	That is because people believe Governments honour their promises.  The present Government does not, where decentralisation is concerned.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I have not yet heard Fine Gael or Labour state one town or county that should not be included.The scheme is voluntary and there are industrial relations procedures in this country.  The implementation group makes it quite clear that a breakthrough will be required regarding the State agencies to try to get the programme up and running to match the headway made in respect of the Civil Service.  In this regard, there is already a culture of staff crossing from Department to Department.  They are retrained when they cross over and are very anxious to move to the various locations.We are aware that some parts of the programme are moving ahead more speedily than others.  I agree that one of the roles of Ministers in their line Departments is to continue to push for the implementation of the programme subject to respecting its voluntary nature and working with the unions concerned.  The industrial relations machinery of the State should be used as creatively and constructively as possible to bring about solutions to problems regarding which there has not been progress.  This has been acknowledged by me for some time but that is not to say the decentralisation programme should not go ahead as quickly as possible in all areas with a view to dealing with the more intractable problems that resulted in a major delay in progress, particularly in some State agencies, on the basis of industrial relations procedures.  Such procedures are the best means of dealing with the problems.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The onus is on politicians to come up with responses.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The programme for Government contains certain commitments in the area of taxation policy, including a commitment to establish a commission on taxation that will have a wide remit to consider the structure of the taxation system.  It will be charged specifically with considering and making recommendations.  For example, it will examine the balance achieved between taxes collected on income, capital and spending and report thereon; review all tax expenditures with a view to recommending the discontinuation of those that are unjustifiable on cost-benefit grounds; and consider options for the future financing of local government.  Furthermore, in the context of maintaining a strong economy, the commission will investigate fiscal measures to protect and enhance the environment, including the introduction of a carbon levy or tax.I will bring proposals to Government in the near future on matters relating to the establishment of the proposed commission, including its membership and terms of reference.  Pending consideration by the Government of these proposals, I am not in a position to elaborate further on matters pertaining to the commission or its work programme.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	50	This proposal was made in some detail by the Labour Party.  I am glad that, in the context of the formation of the new Government, the Taoiseach accepted, however reluctantly, that there should be a commission on taxation.  I am aware that the Tánaiste has been an opponent of the idea of achieving tax justice, particularly for ordinary PAYE workers.  He obviously had to bow to the exigencies of the situation and accept that there would be some form of commission on taxation.It is important that there be some discussion on what the commission will do.  In this context, it is very important that the Tánaiste outline to the House his thinking on who will head the commission and who its members will be.  If they are simply those with vested interests, such as those in the Irish Taxation Institute and tax accountants, who make a lot of money advising very rich people on how not to pay tax, it would be unacceptable.  Will ordinary PAYE taxpayers, who are the people who need tax justice, be represented?  Will the commission be composed mainly of those who help rich people to pay little or no tax here?  That is the critical question and I would be grateful if the Minister would elaborate on his proposals.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	51	First, I wish to disabuse the Deputy of a few notions she put forward as if they had a factual basis.  I assure her that in my discussions — I headed the negotiations on behalf of my party regarding the formulation of the programme for Government — I was not aware of the Labour Party's proposals.  They certainly did not form part of my discussions since the Labour Party was not prepared to take our calls at any time over the past few weeks.  That is a matter for the Labour Party to figure out.I do not know where the Deputy got the idea that I opposed the establishment of the commission on taxation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The Minister was also opposed to the reform of stamp duty and this fell into the same category.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	53	May I reply to the assertions made in this question?  The Deputy suggested that I was an opponent of the establishment of the commission on taxation.  That is groundless.  I negotiated with others the terms of the programme for Government that was unanimously adopted by the parliamentary party and I welcomed that vote of confidence.  The suggestion by Deputy Burton that I opposed this commission is totally at variance with the facts since I negotiated its establishment.  We have not had a commission on taxation for more than 30 years and I felt it would be timely to set up one.  I would also point to the previous budgets and Finance Bills I have introduced into this House that have greatly assisted working families, to a much greater extent than was done by any of my predecessors, as the facts show in terms of disposable income and those who now pay tax, and the fact that capital taxes now pay almost four times more as a percentage of total tax revenue than when the Labour Party was in government.  I could go on all evening but I do not have time because I want to answer some questions.  I disabuse the Deputy of all those notions, wherever they came from.I will bring forward proposals on the membership of the commission.  I must discuss the matter with my advisers and officials to decide on the best thing to do.  They are good, qualified people who are competent to do this work.  I will then go to Government and when Government makes a decision I will come to the House to be held accountable for it all.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Is the Minister implying, as with other studies carried out by his Department on taxation, that the majority of people on this commission will come from the tax avoidance industry, as opposed to people interested in tax justice for PAYE workers?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	55	There are no grounds for that assertion.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	56	To recall the Minister's history, in the last four Finance Bills the Labour Party tabled amendments proposing the establishment of a commission on taxation and on each occasion, to put it inelegantly, the Minister rubbished the proposal.  He is a late and reluctant convert to the idea.  This is welcome, however, provided it is a serious attempt to achieve tax justice.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	57	As usual there is no basis to the Deputy's speculation about the composition of the commission.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the scope for reducing the VAT rate on environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate of 21% to the reduced rate of 13.5%.  This is just one of a number of initiatives in the programme aimed at delivering a cleaner environment.In carrying out this examination, account will be taken of the growing range of environmental and renewable energy products which present opportunities to reduce our dependence on conventional energy systems and can make a contribution to tackling climate change.  For example, energy efficient insulation materials, renewable energy systems, including wind, solar and geothermal systems, and the options arising in the bio-energy crop sector will be examined.In considering a change in VAT arrangements for these, or indeed any other, goods and services, it is important to bear in mind that the treatment of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.It is important, however, to point out that the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5% may currently be applied to insulation materials and renewable energy systems where these products are supplied and installed as a single contract and where the VAT-exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two thirds of the total VAT-exclusive charge to the customer.  The bulk of supply and install contracts are likely to meet this so-called "two thirds" rule, resulting in the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% being applied.  Consequently, under existing VAT arrangements, the reduced VAT rate can apply to environmental products where they form part of such a supply and installation arrangement.The reduced VAT rate of 13.5% also applies to the supply of all fuel products, including wood pellets, used for home heating and light.  The Republic of Ireland is one of only eight member states that apply a reduced VAT rate to the supply of fuel products used for home heating and light.The purpose of our proposed VAT review is to examine whether there is scope within EU VAT law to further extend the application of the reduced VAT rate in the area of environmental goods and services.  This and other measures under the programme for Government clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to addressing the environmental challenges that we face.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Will this review be completed in time for the 2008 budget so that we will see some of these proposals reflected in next year's Finance Bill?  The Minister seems to be watering down expectations on the basis that most of the VAT concessions are already available if allowed for within certain contracts.  Is the Minister considering green spot rating of products to allow for differential VAT rates on products according to their energy efficiency?  Many products already have differential rating.  Is this what the Minister has in mind to allow consumers pay a lower VAT rate on the same product if it has a lower energy use rating?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The examination can consider all these issues.  The law on VAT is a very technical area.  EU VAT directives are the determining and over-arching legislative basis upon which these VAT issues are dealt with and we cannot take unilateral action to do what we wish regarding reductions in VAT, even though the public sometimes thinks we can.  We must be in compliance with VAT law and that is often determined by the state of our VAT law in respect of goods and services at the time of the implementation of the directive.  This explains the differing rates of VAT applying to various goods and services in different jurisdictions and which can often be a source of confusion to the public who question the reason we cannot move to those rates at this stage.The examination will be comprehensive and will seek out the best way forward.  As regards its timeliness, I will seek to have the examination completed as soon as is possible and practicable.  In respect of any changes in our taxation arrangements, these are matters to be considered in a budgetary context, taking into account the overall state of the economy, and I will deal with them in the normal way.

What is the Minister's reaction to the proposal by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that in order to combat the pressures on workers of cost of living increases, particularly since the advent of Towards 2016, the Government should reduce the rate of VAT from its current level of 21%, which is the second highest indirect tax in Europe?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	62	There are various rates of tax in existence and I refer to the rate of 0% on foodstuffs which is an important protection for Irish consumers and a rate which is not available in every other jurisdiction in the EU.The question refers to a programme for Government commitment specifically in respect of environmental goods and services.  It is in such a context that the examination will take place.  It will be limited, being directed at that commitment, with no wider review envisaged.  These are matters for consideration at the time of every budget.  I continue to emphasise that it is not merely a case of asking why we should not change specific rates.  There are considerations to do with EU law on VAT with which we must comply.  The area is very technical and requires expert advice before one makes any moves.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Is the intent behind the Minister's proposal to favour activities, services or goods that help reduce energy consumption or carbon emissions and, correspondingly, to punish or penalise those activities that result in excessive carbon pollution or are excessively inefficient from an energy perspective?  What is the fundamental purpose of the proposed review of VAT?  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The purpose will be to encourage changed behaviour and the greater utilisation of more energy-efficient means of providing goods and services as a means of contributing towards greater energy conservation and raising public awareness of the importance of avoiding unnecessary energy use.  That is the background to the review.I am aware that Mr. Gordon Brown, in his capacity as British Chancellor of the Exchequer, has written to the EU Commission suggesting that it formulate a proposal whereby member states might apply reduced rates of VAT to energy-efficient products and energy-saving materials as an incentive for the private consumer to make more sustainable decisions.I have no difficulty with the Commission examining such an approach and introducing proposals to the ECOFIN Council on the matter.  It is in line with such efforts to establish policy initiatives.  Upon examination, what can be done to facilitate far greater use of such technologies will be done.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Does the Minister for Finance have proposals regarding those suffering from fuel poverty, for example, the elderly, most of whom must use coal and other high-carbon fuels?
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	67	That is outside the scope of this question, which deals with VAT.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Will the Minister take that into account?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	69	We have ensured that income support for people on social welfare and pensions has risen well in excess of inflation, the figure for last year being between 8% and 12%.  We were able to consider such increases to assist people.  There have been changes to fuel allowances and so on, for example, by extending the period for which people are eligible for such supplementary schemes, in an effort to deal with fuel poverty.  That includes what has been happening with community-based initiatives for the insulation of social housing, elderly people living alone, and disabled persons' grants.  All those are efforts to ensure that those most vulnerable to fuel poverty receive the necessary assistance so that it is not a serious problem for them.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The value-for-money and policy reviews process encompasses formal value-for-money reviews, as well as all other policy reviews conducted and commissioned by Departments which have an impact on value for money.  Under the new arrangements, the Government approved some 90 formal value-for-money reviews to be carried out for the period 2006-08.  That programme of reviews focuses on significant areas of expenditure and major policy issues.Details of the programme of reviews have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I also wrote to the Chairman of each select committee on 5 October 2006 setting out the reviews to take place relevant to that committee's remit.  The reviews, when completed, will normally be published and submitted to the relevant select committee for consideration.  Responsibility for carrying out each review and for publishing and submitting it to the Oireachtas committees rests with the individual Departments and offices.To date in 2007, seven reviews have been completed under the new arrangements.  These are:Department/OfficeReport TitleOffice of the Houses of the OireachtasExpenditure Review of the IT Service Level AgreementEnvironment, Heritage and Local GovernmentOnline Motor TaxAgriculture and FoodLaboratory Testing for Plant Health, Feedingstuffs, Fertilisers, Forestry and CropsFinanceGrant-in-Aid to Ordnance Survey IrelandSocial and Family AffairsUnemployment Benefit/Assistance for atypical workersCommunications, Marine and Natural ResourcesPublic (Exchequer and EU) Supports for Aquaculture 2000-2005Justice, Equality and Law ReformIrish Prison Service Capital Expenditure ReviewI am also informed, based on the latest information available to my Department, that 69 of the 92 reviews scheduled for completion under this current round to end at the end of next year are either completed or under way.  Of these, 20 reviews have been completed while a further 14 have reached the stage where they are quality assessed by an independent party before being finalised and published.If the Deputy wishes to receive information on progress in regard to individual reviews, I suggest he pursue the matter with the relevant Minister.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Does the Minister agree this is a totally pathetic outturn from what was to be a very important element in getting value for money?  That only seven reviews out of the requirement of 30 per year have been completed, in even the very unambitious programme the Minister published, is way behind schedule.  The Minister read out the topics which I conservatively guess represent approximately one quarter of 1% of public spending which is under scrutiny in these reports.  This is not scrutiny in any meaningful sense.Will the Minister immediately lift the embargo on any value for money reviews being conducted in the Department of Health and Children, one of the Departments which spends the most money in this State, much of which is not giving the value we should get from it?  Will he also lift the embargo on examining value for money in the Office of Public Works?  Again, the fact it is involved in decentralisation is offered as a spurious reason why it should not come under scrutiny.Will the Minister implement, as was intended when this legislation was introduced in the Dáil, the proper mandate to have a rolling programme of expenditure review which considers at least 25% of public spending each year?  Let us have meaningful scrutiny in the House.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	72	That is available to committees anyway.  Taking this specific structured review of value for money, we are talking about approximately €6.5 billion of expenditure being reviewed.  We can have ambitious programmes of reviewing 25% of public spending and not get it done properly or we can do it properly in respect of what is achievable and what should, and can, be done.  It is not exclusively through this structured review that review of value for money continues when we have capital appraisal guidelines and the output statements from Departments.  They will be set against performance next year as against outputs — what people expect to get for the money they spend.  I have put budgetary reform processes in place which would generally be regarded as improvements as well.We discussed this issue before and I took it up with Departments but I expect the areas which have been agreed will be dealt with within the timeframe about which we are talking.  As I said, 69 of the 92 are in place at present.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The testing of plant is hardly a mainstream concern of people worried about value for money.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I have answered the Deputy's question.  The total area——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Minister should look at the answer he has given.  It is ridiculous.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The total area under review — the 92 areas — covers over €6.5 billion.  That is a significant amount of money.  It is open to the committees and I have invited the Chairmen of the committees to monitor this process.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	77	One cannot monitor plant testing.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	78	That is only one of 92 areas.  The Deputy should not suggest that is the issue.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The whole list is of that nature.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The issue is the €6.5 billion.  The point I make is that there have been reforms in the budgetary process which are bringing greater accountability and a greater sense to the Oireachtas as to the outputs expected for the money being spent and which also ensure that during the course of next year — the first full year — we can mark that performance against the proposed outputs.  Then we can have a really beneficial discussion beyond rhetorical counterblast about what we are doing in regard to these areas and where we are and are not getting value for money.  These are important reforms in addition to these internal departmental reviews which take place.  Important as they are in respect of €6.5 billion of expenditure, we also have the output statements from each Department and the performance targets set against them in regard to all areas of expenditure which will be available for committees to examine, detail and work on once they are published and people are brought before them to answer for the performance.That is a fairer indication of the total value for money effort being made because it is in all our interests that taxpayers' money is spent, to the greatest possible extent, efficiently and effectively.  Everyone is agreed on that.  We use the committee system, the Oireachtas and these internal departmental reviews as the mechanism by which we can chart to what extent we are getting the outputs we expect for the money we spend and to hold people to account thereafter.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	81	In the context of the review, has the Minister been able to give guidance to the HSE on the distinction between capital expenditure and revenue and current expenditure?  Embarrassingly, the Minister had to come to the House some years ago to correct errors in the HSE's capital budget.  In recent days, we have again seen the HSE underspend its capital budget by €90 million only to deny it is a problem as the money can be switched over to revenue.  The difference between capital and current expenditure is fundamental.  Leaving aside all this other fancy stuff, has the Minister been able to talk to the HSE to establish whether it has made another multi-million euro error in its distinction between capital and revenue?  Has the Minister managed to ring and sort it out for them?  There is no point talking about reviewing public expenditure if the HSE, which spends nearly €13 billion and rising per year, cannot distinguish between what is capital and what is current.

Would the Minister support the initiation by the Comptroller and Auditor General of a full review of current and previous PPPs to compare Revenue costs and wastage to the long-term projected costs and potential costs of the alternative approach to such projects?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	88	To answer the questions in reverse order, I am aware of Deputy Ó Caoláin's outright opposition to public private partnerships.  PPPs can be and are used to meet public sector benchmarks.  We establish if there is a way to carry out a project through public private partnership which is better than through the traditional procurement method.  There is no doubt that the private sector is in a position to deliver projects far more quickly, unfortunately, than the public sector currently can.  It is a reality those of us who support public services must ensure we deal with to get the efficiencies required.  Taxpayers are agnostic in Tubbercurry and everywhere else about who builds a school as long as they get one.  It is our job as the people who are accountable for taxpayers' money to ensure the process we use, whether traditional procurement or PPP, and the mechanisms we put in place confirm for taxpayers that we have adopted the most effective approach.PPPs are a feature of our multi-annual capital programme and will remain so.  I would hate to think where our roads programme would be were we simply depending on traditional public sector procurement and interaction between local authorities to build a motorway system.

We have put forward reforms and improvements, like the public sector benchmark requirements, which deal with a great many of the issues.  We cannot continue to roll the matter over, argue repeatedly and expect that people will find schools on their doorsteps while we are here talking about it.  Let us get on with the business we have been told to engage in.  While we look at reviews and listen to what people have to say, Government has to govern and make decisions.  I am satisfied the improvements in public private partnership processes are such as to provide the best possible value for the taxpayer.  The public sector benchmark is our best guarantee of that.  Where a PPP proceeds, it proceeds on the basis that it beats those benchmarks.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 96 together.The programme for Government indicates the Government will mandate the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance to present an outline carbon report in conjunction with the annual financial budget.  As the programme for Government suggests, the content of a carbon budget will be a matter for the Government to decide.As the Deputy is aware my colleague, Deputy John Gormley, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has primary responsibility for the issue of climate change and so will have a major input into the establishment and configuration of the carbon budget.  My Department will consult the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on all aspects of this.The data collated for the carbon budget will be obtained from several agencies.  Accordingly, it may take some time to put all this data together.  The Government will consider the parameters of a carbon budget and will report in due course.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	113	With regard to the carbon budget, will the Oireachtas be presented with choices in the same way as it is for the Estimates in the ordinary budget process whereby we can make decisions on various policy approaches?  Will it be a dynamic process of this nature or will it record in a dead way what happened in the previous year?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	114	As the programme for Government points out, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has primary responsibility for the issue of climate change, will produce an annual report outlining our use of energy in the preceding year, the progress made in meeting reduction targets and Government plans to meet the targets of the following year.  An effort is being made——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The Minister for Finance will introduce this under the programme for Government.  He cannot say it is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It is his carbon budget.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I will outline the general position but under the programme for Government the detailed issues of how we will proceed to meet the target for the following year will be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	117	It is suggested in the Programme for Government that the Minister for Finance will do it and not the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	122	It does not sound like the Minister has internalised this idea.

Governments purchase carbon offsets every time they take a long-distance hike and they invest in a tree somewhere.  I invite the Minister to have an entire rain forest named after him——

We know the Minister for Finance is unlikely to be one of them.  It would be interesting to know what it is.  Do the Minister's Green Party colleagues have him making a note of his carbon footprint on a weekly basis?

The standing order allows for a brief question on a matter of topical public importance from the leader of the Fine Gael and Labour parties.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I wondered for a moment if the Deputy had been appointed to the job of Ceann Comhairle.  I wish to raise a matter that is of topical importance and of public interest, that is, the fact that in recent weeks we have seen the Taoiseach do a number of deals on behalf of the Government with a number of Independent Members in return for supporting him as Taoiseach.  A number of these Deputies have said that these deals have cost hundreds of millions of euro.  The Taoiseach is well aware that we have an established procedure here for the disbursement of public funds.  Estimates are introduced, debated, discussed and passed.  This is public knowledge.  The taxpayer is entitled to know how every euro of taxpayer's money is spent.  The taxpayer is entitled to know the decisions that underlie that process in the public interest and is entitled to know any agreement that is reached in respect of the use of public money for any such deal.  One of the Deputies involved, Deputy Finian McGrath, has said that pressure is on him from Fianna Fáil sources not to publish the details——

Deputy Lowry has said that his deal involves access and very substantial moneys.  Following an extraordinary statement by the Taoiseach, in advance of a court case that is being taken about another Independent Deputy, he has given what I understand amounts to a verbal commitment of very significant value.

The Standing Order provides that the question from the leader of Fine Gael may last two minutes, that the reply by the Taoiseach may last three minutes, that the supplementary question from the leader of Fine Gael may last one minute and that the final reply by the Taoiseach will be of one minute's duration.  The same facility and courtesy will be extended to the leader of Fine Gael.  That is the Standing Order and it is only fair to other Members of the House that the Standing Orders should be enforced.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	194	In view of the arrangements that have been made between the Taoiseach, either as head of Fianna Fáil or on behalf of the Government, with a number of Deputies in the House — including Deputies Finian McGrath, Lowry, Healy-Rae and Flynn — and given that these involve substantial amounts of public money, changes to the national development plan, details of international significance and unknown verbal commitments, will the Taoiseach see to it that these arrangements are published in the public interest?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I confirm that as leader of Fianna Fáil I entered into political arrangements with Deputies Lowry, Healy-Rae and Finian McGrath.  I have no arrangement with Deputy Flynn.The issues discussed, as is normal and appropriate, are covered in the national development plan, Transport 21 and the multi-annual capital programmes for public expenditure.  I have committed myself through my best endeavours to implement priorities for these Deputies over the next five years.  The projects are not outside planned current or capital expenditure in the years ahead.  I have endeavoured over the past ten years in good faith and as best I can to deliver on political commitments I have made during the lifetime of the Government.  The issues are not outside what we are trying to do.  Several times I have tried to bring forward initiatives more quickly and efficiently and I intend to honour these political commitments to the three Deputies.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Can I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that he has allocated sections of the national development plan that might be geographically based to individual Deputies who are or were Independent?  If so, will he publish and indicate the sections of the NDP allocated to Deputies Healy-Rae, Lowry and Finian McGrath?  Will he confirm that he has no agreement whatsoever with Deputy Flynn in view of the fact that it has been announced that he gave a verbal commitment to the good Deputy after making a truly extraordinary statement?  It appears as if what the Taoiseach has announced is nothing more than regurgitated sections of the NDP and the deals or arrangements with these Members are political and nothing extraordinary.  Will he confirm that none of the deals involves direct access to him or Ministers without hindrance?  If that is not the case, Fianna Fáil backbenchers, including the Ceann Comhairle, will find that access to Ministers has been given to these Members to prioritise sections of the NDP and the Ceann Comhairle might be concerned about this in view of events in Kerry.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the position?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I am glad to clarify it.  I have entered into political commitments that concern priority issues for the three Members concerned.  I have made political commitments to three Members, not four.  The issues are covered by the programme for Government, the NDP, Transport 21 and other Government documents.  These Members have issues they want progressed, delivered and implemented and, as I have done for the past decade, I will do my utmost to do that.  Sections of the NDP will not be allocated.  Members have a particular interest in issues in their own constituencies or on a wider basis, such as Deputy Finian McGrath who has a special and long-standing interest in disabilities.  He wants issues progressed and delivered and he will be able to do that.With regard to contact, the Members concerned will have direct contact with the Whip's office, as has been the case for the past decade.

Is there a record of these agreements?  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to publish them and, if so, when will they be published?  I have a sheaf of papers, which the former lenient occupant of the Chair might have given me time to read out, but I will rush through one or two of them.  Deputy Healy-Rae stated he had secured commitments worth tens of millions of euros for his constituency and Deputy Finian McGrath said what he had agreed was worth hundreds of millions of euro nationally, including €300 million for services for people with disabilities.  Deputy Healy-Rae stated it is a private, personal document and that there is no hope in the wide earthly world of us seeing it.  This is all taxpayers' money and I would like the Taoiseach to indicate whether these will be published.We have a number of Independent Deputies running around the House waving bits of paper, admittedly fairly opaquely.  We know Deputy Healy-Rae seems to be ferrying around a piece of paper like the third secret of Fatima and all one can see is that the deal is with Fianna Fáil.  We seem to have an extraordinary situation where there are four Independent Deputies in the House who think they have written deals with the Taoiseach and the Progressive Democrats, a party in Government, has no deal at all.  The Taoiseach will not publish the four deals these Deputies have said are worth hundreds of millions of euro.Is the Taoiseach stating these Independent Deputies are fools and they got nothing at all, as it was all in the national development plan, the multi-annual programme for the budget or Transport 21?  If that is the case, what is the problem?  What is it all about?

They want to prioritise those issues and they have made a political agreement with me on them.  From the experience of some of those Deputies and other Deputies who have entered into a similar arrangement over the last decade, it can be seen that I do my utmost to deliver on the issues, perhaps not to every last degree, but to a very good extent.Deputy Rabbitte was right on practically every issue except one.  The programme for Government outlines the deal the Green Party, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats entered into.  That programme has been published and is well-documented.  The political agreements I entered into are not published but I will give my best endeavour to them.

In today's newspapers he is quoted as saying he may not be given enough time today to read them all in.  Will he be given a second bite in the event that they do not all fit on the first day?Is the Taoiseach stating that the Government is embarking on a programme for Government which gave the Green Party, by its own admission, nothing?  Is he stating that the Progressive Democrats sought and got nothing and that he now has the support of four Independent Deputies who were fooled into believing they got something, when it was already in the national development plan and existing programmes?Is that the case?  It is amazing that one cannot turn on a radio station but Deputy Finian McGrath is insisting he wants to tell us what he got.

The election of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle is a matter of considerable public importance.  There should be a debate, not exceeding 30 minutes, on the manner in which the Government has gone about its business in this instance.  Electoral mandates should be respected.  Given that one third of the Members of this House are Fine Gael Deputies, we should be able to discuss and debate how this process has gone ahead.  Since the Government was appointed some weeks ago, the Taoiseach has been prepared to reward parties with Cabinet seats in return for their support for him.  Secret deals have been agreed with a number of Independent Members, involving unknown quantities of public moneys.  It seems that the details of these political arrangements will not be published, which is confusing for the electorate and especially for taxpayers who are footing the bill without being told how their money is spent.  The Taoiseach has publicly anointed his own successor.  He has publicly praised and wooed a Deputy who was being pursued by a State agency for a considerable amount of money.  He has promised that Deputy a Ministry.

If, as it seems, he is being extremely generous in allocating the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle to the Opposition, he should have shown the courtesy of informing the leaders of the Opposition parties that he intended to allocate the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle to a Member of one of those parties.  He should have allowed us to discuss among ourselves the men and women who might have been suitable nominees as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  To do business in such an inappropriate way is to fail to respect the electoral mandates of the Opposition parties.  The Taoiseach is now the new emperor of Ireland. L’état, c’est moi.  Una duce, una voce.  It appears that the Taoiseach can implement and do whatever the hell he likes from now on.  My amendment proposes that No. 4, which relates to the appointment of the new Leas-Cheann Comhairle, should be the subject of a debate not exceeding 30 minutes.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I would like to propose an amendment to the Schedule to No. 5 on today's Order Paper, so that the reference to "Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 — Order for Second Stage" is deleted.  This motion is similar to motions tabled in the House after previous general elections, seeking to restore to the Order Paper Bills which had commenced progress or had been published in the previous Dáil.  The list of Bills before the House is not controversial, with one exception — the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005, which would enable the Government, for stated reasons and following a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to suspend or dissolve a tribunal of inquiry.  The Labour Party believes the Bill should not be restored to the Order Paper at this stage.  The Bill was originally published in November 2005.  Nothing was done with it and no effort was made to progress it until suddenly in October of last year in the immediate aftermath of the disclosure that the Mahon tribunal was investigating a range of payments received by the Taoiseach from wealthy businessmen when he was Minister for Finance in 1994, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, decided that the Bill was urgent and should be taken.  As a result of strong objections raised by the Labour Party and by the Green Party, the Government was forced to drop its plans to take the Bill last October.  Nothing has been done with it since, but as it is included in the list of Bills to be restored to the Order Paper, it now appears that the new Government is determined to go ahead with it.Restoring the Bill to the Order Paper at this stage would send out all the wrong messages to the public.  It will rightly ask why the Bill is being taken now at a time when the Taoiseach is about to give evidence before the Mahon tribunal.  The Bill must also be seen against repeated complaints by the Taoiseach and his supporters of unfair treatment at the hands of the tribunal.  Last year, Fianna Fáil Ministers made totally unfounded allegations that the tribunal was involved in the leaking of documents relating to the Taoiseach's finances to The Irish Times.  Some people might also see the restoration of the Bill at this point as an attempt to influence or even intimidate the tribunals and those working for them and the Bill will be seen as a sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of the tribunals.Public confidence in politics and political standards is already low.  At this point, we do not need the pressure in respect of this measure.  The Labour Party strongly recommends to the Government that the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 be deleted from the list of Bills to be restored.  I will move my amendment.

When Deputy Kenny talks about respect for mandates, I hope that will be a universal respect here and that the Sinn Féin mandate and that of Deputy Tony Gregory will also be respected.  In respect of whether a debate should be held, I have no issue with Deputy Kenny's proposal, but I wish to record at this point that I have no issue either with the nominee for the position and wish him well.In respect of the second proposition from Deputy Burton, on behalf of the Sinn Féin Deputies, I absolutely concur with the proposal before us.  Looking at the list of Bills to be restored to the Dáil Order Paper, the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 stands out and absolutely jumps off the page.  This Bill should not be restored to the Dáil Order Paper.  We in Sinn Féin are calling again for it to be withdrawn by Government.  We recognise — and it is important to say so — the need for spiralling costs to be tackled, but no legislation should be introduced that would hinder the work of tribunals in terms of limiting their abilities to uncover the truth.  This Bill has many serious shortcomings.  We have already put on record in the House repeatedly our concerns in respect of this legislation.We have pointed out the similarities between the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 and the British Inquiries Act.  The Taoiseach will recall that during Question Time we both addressed this issue in the context of the murder of Pat Finucane.  The British Inquiries Act is standing in the way of the Finucane family's quest for justice.  We believe the proposals contained in the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill are equally flawed.  There will be a difference of opinion on that matter but there is no question that the similarities are stark.  There is no way that Bill should be restored to the Order Paper at this time, as has been indicated, or in this form at any time.I fully concur with Deputy Burton's amendment on behalf of the Labour Party and the Sinn Féin Deputies will support it.  I call on the Taoiseach to accede to the request to have that obnoxious legislation removed from the list of those Bills to be restored to the Order Paper.

I have already made it perfectly clear in the previous Dáil and at the start of this Dáil that we will not stand for the Government, off the top of its head, declaring that the guillotine will be used on every one of these Bills.  The time should be open-ended.  This matter is to do with stamp duty, in respect of which the Fianna Fáil party had no interest for the past ten years.  It was provoked by the then leader of the Progressive Democrats who stated that the billions of euro collected in stamp duty were not required at all.  The Green Party and others were very vociferous about these matters.  The Government proposed relief for first-time buyers and this is supportable but a whole range of other areas need to be dealt with.  For this reason and because of the number of Members who want to speak on this Bill, I object to a guillotine being proposed.

This is the second guillotine proposed today.  The purpose and reason for our presence in this House is to hold the Executive to account.  If debate is stultified to the degree proposed here, only one of the 20 Labour Party Deputies will be allowed speak, and that will be for a short and curtailed time of 15 minutes.  This is a very short speaking time on this type of issue.  We are opposed to the use of the guillotine as a routine parliamentary measure.  We accept it may be required and necessary on occasion but not as a routine measure where every debate would simply stop when the Government decided it should.I ask that Standing Orders be examined under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle in committee to see how the Government can be prevented from abusing the House in this manner.

The proposal is to guillotine Second Stage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill at 7 p.m. but when is the debate to commence?  There will be very little time for debate.  While other parties can refer to limited opportunities, as this is ordered, the Sinn Féin Deputies will have no opportunity.  This is fundamentally wrong as we have the right to participate and to offer our opinions and suggestions as to how this Bill could be better formulated and moulded to suit the needs of those who need the supports most.  Sinn Féin will oppose the proposition that Second Stage be guillotined at 7 p.m.  I question whether there is any precedent for the guillotine being utilised on the first sitting day following a general election.

The first relates to the Order of Business today.  Yesterday, people protested against the M3 motorway outside the office of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  A spokesperson on the Minister's behalf stated he could not meet them because he was preparing for parliamentary questions today.  Did they fall off the schedule?  I do not believe he is due to answer until October.The second matter concerns the Bill to increase the number of people who may serve as Ministers of State.  I notice an explanatory memorandum was not circulated with the Bill.  According to the Cabinet handbook, an explanatory and financial memorandum is not only necessary in the case of major Bills but is a mandatory requirement in the case of Government Bills other than consolidation Bills.This Bill is listed for tomorrow and there is no explanatory memorandum or commentary as regards the cost of this measure which seeks to increase the number of Ministers of State.  When one adds chairpersons of committees, anybody in Fianna Fáil who does not get one or the other will need counselling given the number of positions we will create.  Before we start the debate I wish to know whether an explanatory memorandum will be circulated.

The explanatory memorandum states the purpose of the Bill is to increase from 17 to 20 the statutory limit on the number of Ministers of State the Government can appoint.  The office of Minister of State was first set out in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1977 which provided for a maximum number of ten Ministers of State.  This number was increased to 15 under section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1980.  It was further increased to 17 under section 1 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1995.

It is something of a hodgepodge at present whereby one Deputy constitutes a party for party leaders' fund, two party members is a sufficient quota for committee members and the recognition of a whip and it takes seven party members to obtain speaking rights in debates and Leaders' Questions in the House.

He has been a distinguished Member in many respects and has held ministerial office both as Minister for Health and Children and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and has been engaged in most positions in the House and in most committees.

We cannot have a debate on it because that has already been agreed to.  What I will allow, in accordance with Standing Orders, is a brief debate on Deputy Howlin's elevation to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

It was because Deputy Ring imputed unfairness to the Chair.  No such allegation can be made in the House against the Chair.  It is my function to be fair to every Member of the House, irrespective of his or her political persuasion or none, and I have sought to do this.  The difficulty is that Deputy Ring persisted in saying I was making the rules up as I was going along.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The position is set out very clearly in Standing Order 9.  I could not take the amendment proposed by Deputy Kenny.  I again reassure Members that it is not possible for the Chair to accept an imputation like that.  It is not possible to have the integrity of the Chair undermined in that way because if that were to happen, the integrity of the House itself would be undermined and I could not stand for that.  I must again ask Deputy Ring to leave the House.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I will leave the House.  The Ceann Comhairle already named a Member of this House today three times and did not ask that Member to leave the House.  He did not quote to me the Standing Order he used in respect of the imposition of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I will leave this House under protest on the basis that if the Ceann Comhairle continues in the way in which he has been continuing, there will be a vote of no confidence in him quicker than he knows.  I am leaving the House under protest.  I did nothing wrong and was treated unfairly in this House today.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	381	On a point of order, it would seem that in the excitement the Ceann Comhairle inadvertently forgot No. 5.  It has not been dealt with.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	383	In respect of No. 4, Standing Order 9 states that notice is required, and I accept that.  However, today's Order Paper contains the nomination of Deputy Howlin, against whom I have nothing at all, as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Standing Order 30 states four days' notice must be given of a motion so that an amendment to it can be tabled with two days' notice.  Many of these matters are at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle.  If I am wrong — and I accept what the Standing Order states about notice — the notice on today's Order Paper was not circulated in accordance with the other Standing Order which requires four days' notice.  I am not proposing a new motion on the election of Leas-Cheann Comhairle but an amendment to what the Taoiseach wishes to speak about.  I would prefer to come back to No. 4 and deal with that.  Throughout the discussions I said I had objections to the motion before the House and I merely wish to clarify those objections.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	385	On No. 4, the Taoiseach said he wished to nominate Deputy Howlin as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Deputy Rabbitte did not have an opportunity to respond to that.  If Deputy Rabbitte wishes to respond first, I might then clarify my reasons for objecting to the motion in the manner proposed by the Taoiseach.

I do not know if Deputy Kenny heard me say that, but that is precisely what I said.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I was asked if I objected to the motion and I said "Yes".

I said "No, it is not and I object to it".  The Ceann Comhairle should then have put the question but you did not.

The Taoiseach confirmed that he wished the Opposition to hold the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  That being the case, the Leaders of the Opposition parties should at least have been invited to nominate a person whom the Opposition would put forward as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.The Taoiseach has made a magnanimous gesture in allowing the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to be appointed from the Opposition benches.  However, he has gone further and named an individual Deputy without any consultation with the Fine Gael Party which has 51 Members, almost a third of the Dáil Members.  That shows contempt and shows no respect for an electoral mandate given to us by more than 500,000 people.

I am sure many Deputies would fulfil the duties of Leas-Cheann Comhairle with great distinction.  I wanted to propose the name of Deputy Pádraic McCormack, a long-serving Member with a great understanding of the rules in local authority, Seanad and Dáil business.  He is a fitting person to hold this office.I do not mean to be disrespectful to any other Member but the way in which this has been dealt with by the Government bypasses the major party in Opposition.  The Taoiseach nominated a Member for the position while at the same time saying the nomination should be drawn from the ranks of the Opposition.  It has been a long time since this happened and in my view it amounts to contemptuous treatment of the Dáil.In speaking to my objection to the process by which this has been done, I put forward the name of Deputy Pádraic McCormack.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I will say a word in support of the Taoiseach's nomination of my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Deputy Kenny has quite rightly said there are a number of people in the House who could discharge the functions of Leas-Cheann Comhairle with distinction.  I am bound to say I can think of no Member of the House, however, who is more suited to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle than Deputy Brendan Howlin.  He has served with distinction in this House for 20 years, in different positions in and out of Government.  He is a skilled parliamentarian with a detailed knowledge of parliamentary procedure.  He is dedicated to enhancing the institutions of the Oireachtas.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to second his nomination for Leas-Cheann Comhairle.On the last day I made certain remarks on the election of the Ceann Comhairle about the departure of what is now becoming ancient practice, namely, a Member from the Opposition benches being installed as Ceann Comhairle.  These remarks preceded the election of Deputy O'Donoghue and in no way impute any motives to him, partisan or otherwise.  I do not do that but rather affirm the argument I made on the last day to the effect that it is important the practice of drawing the Ceann Comhairle from the Opposition side of the House should be reverted to.  I acknowledge that the Taoiseach's approach to Deputy Howlin goes some way to redress the imbalance.  However, all of us need to be concerned about both the relevance and perceived relevance of Dáil Éireann as regards its ability to respond to issues that preoccupy the public at any given time and about its agility in responding to issues of topical concern.  More and more nowadays we live in a political environment where the winner takes all.  I do not believe this is good for politics nor for the institutions of these Houses.In addition to some 35 positions of office holders in the last Administration, out of 21 chairmen, 18 were drawn from the Government benches.  I do not believe that is a sustainable position.  It is an honourable tradition in this House that there ought to be a vigorous Opposition.  The fact that positions predominantly go to the Government side of the House is not in keeping with that objective, however.  In conclusion, I do not believe it is adequate for the Ceann Comhairle, his immediate predecessor or any holder of that office to say, in effect, "If you don't like the rules, change them".  The truth is that unless the Government goes along with any proposed rule change, it will not happen.  Frequently in the bartering that goes on, Government will naturally seek to protect its position.  We therefore have to live within the rules as they exist.  It is not just a question of the fair and impartial application of those rules, but a matter of their fair, impartial and commonsense application.  Otherwise this side of the House is greatly constrained in its primary task of holding the Government to account.Having said that, I am delighted to second the nomination of Deputy Brendan Howlin.  It is an important gesture that there is somebody in the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle who is respected on all sides of the House, who has that knowledge of parliamentary procedure and who is dedicated to fairness.  On my behalf and that of my party colleagues I wish him well in the discharge of the functions of that office.

I hope that is what he meant and that he was not just referring to the two main Opposition parties.  It is important that all parties and Opposition voices have the right to be consulted on such an important appointment given that we are all answerable to the Chair during the course of debate and other matters in this Chamber.  It is important that we feel we are part of the selection process and are not just handed a fait accompli.
While I recognise that Deputy Kenny's nominee, Deputy McCormack, is a fine and able Deputy with many years of experience, it is unfortunate that Deputy Howlin finds himself in stormy waters that are not of his making in the passage of his nomination.

Accordingly, the Sinn Féin Deputies will support Deputy Howlin's nomination to the position in line with the nomination originally presented.  However, I ask that the points Deputy Kenny made on the future conduct of the selection process be taken on board by the Taoiseach — perhaps he will not be in a position to do so on the next occasion.  I hope that whoever holds the position of Taoiseach in the future will listen to the concerns of Deputies regarding this election to the role of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

When Deputy Kenny first made the proposal, I did not know the name of the Deputy concerned.  I merely pointed out then, and point out now that under the rules of the House it simply was not possible for me to accept, without notice from Deputy Kenny, a name by way of amendment to Deputy Howlin's nomination.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am glad to introduce this, my fourth Finance Bill to the House.  In my first Bill in 2005, I concentrated on reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners.  In my second Bill in 2006, I reformed and refocused the structure of investment tax reliefs and set a minimum tax which the well-off must pay.  In my third Bill earlier this year, I sought to ensure that the benefit of strong economic growth is shared by all taxpayers and, in particular, low and middle income earners.  In this, my fourth Bill, I am implementing a very specific stamp duty reform, as set out in the programme for Government, to exempt all first-time buyers from stamp duty.I will take a little time to review where we are now in regard to first-time buyers.  In my last budget I indicated it was the Government's aim to help first-time buyers directly and substantially, including those who were already paying their first mortgages.  I did this by increasing mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers from €4,000 single and €8,000 married or widowed per year, to €8,000 and €16,000 respectively.  This measure helped first-time buyers who were already in their first home, as well as brand new first-time buyers.This bill is the first instalment in the implementation of the programme for Government.  It is testament to the good faith of this Government that the first measure it promised to deliver for the people is the first measure it will deliver.  The proposals it contains are timely, affordable, targeted and will support one of the most important sectors of our economy.  It will do all this in a way that directly assists those without any housing equity of their own in their efforts to acquire their first home.Home ownership is one of the primary aspirations of the people.  It provides a secure environment in which to grow up and grow old, and it strengthens communities and improves the environment.  It provides parents with a valuable asset to pass on to their children.  As Minister for Finance, I have always supported home ownership through targeted policy initiatives and these proposed changes mark a continuation of a process of support for first-time buyers which I put in place in my first budget.The housing market has enjoyed remarkable growth in terms of both output and prices over the past decade or so.  We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of homes built.  In 1996, 33,725 new homes were built.  Last year, that number was 93,419.  Huge progress has been made in raising supply to meet very strong demand which has had a moderating impact on price inflation.  I welcome that moderation on both social and economic sustainability grounds.  I far prefer to see house prices increasing at a modest pace in line with changes in affordability.  These increases can be sustained in the long term; double-digit increases cannot be.  Therefore, it is in everyone's best interests, including first-time buyers, existing owners, construction workers and the population as a whole, that prices increase at a moderate rate which reflects fundamentals, which I remind the House remain sound.We have heard much speculation about the economic outlook in recent times, much of it of a negative variety.  I accept there are risks to the outlook but I believe our economy will continue to outperform most of our peers.  The residential construction sector is easing back towards more sustainable activity levels and this is having an impact.  However, it should be noted that commercial property activity remains very strong and that the roll-out of the national development plan will also have a positive impact on growth levels, not least in the construction sector.  At the same time, the external demand environment, most notably in continental Europe, is brightening and that is something which all exporters will welcome.  Certainly, the impact of tighter monetary policy is serving to dampen economic activity but a moderation of pace should not be mistaken for a substantial and sustained deterioration in our economy's performance.Our economy is set to enjoy strong growth rates over the medium term, albeit at a lower level than enjoyed over the past ten years.  By accepting that more moderate outlook now, we can make it a reality and enjoy the much talked of "soft landing".  It is essential that we adapt our expectations in the property market in relation to Government spending growth and in the wider economy to that calmer but still positive growth environment.  That is the best means by which we can secure our prosperity for the long term.The outlook for the Irish economy remains broadly positive.  The main impetus for Irish economic growth in recent years has been domestic demand which is set to continue this year.  Against that favourable background, in 2007 both GDP and GNP growth are forecast to be broadly in line with our sustainable medium-term growth rate of around 5%.  In addition, the labour market has performed very strongly, with employment growth of 4.4% in 2006.  Employment is expected to remain strong, with growth of over 70,000 jobs projected for 2007 while unemployment is forecast to average 4.4%.  Our economic success in recent years ensures we can face any future economic challenges from a position of relative strength.Construction has become an increasingly important sector of the economy in recent years.  Within construction, home building accounted for 11.4% of GDP in 2006, compared to 4.6% of GDP in 1997.  Driven by economic and demographic fundamentals, around 570,000 new houses have been built.  Despite this rapid growth in house building, the stock of houses per head of population is still one of the lowest in the euro area, implying there is still scope for a significant level of house construction.  However, the housing market has slowed in recent months, in part due to uncertainty relating to stamp duty.  In introducing this measure to reform stamp duty, I intend both to remove uncertainty from the housing market and to reduce the cost of home purchase for first-time buyers.  This will allow people to buy and sell their homes in a more stable market environment and help to restore necessary confidence to the market.In the past five years, the number of new homes being built each year has increased from 53,000 to around 90,000 last year.  At this stage we can see housing demand levelling with supply and this is reflected in a slowdown in house price increases.  This is clear evidence that Government policy is working.  With the market stabilising, we have to ensure that any changes that are made must be carefully thought through, given the importance of this sector for jobs in every community in Ireland.While leading indicators of future output, such as new house registrations, new housing starts, planning permissions and the number of new mortgages drawn down by first-time buyers, point to a lower level of completions this year, there is a general consensus that the level of new housing output will decline from last year's record levels, with the current market expectation at around 62,000 new housing starts this year, which is still a very high output by any standard.  Underlying demand remains strong, supported by demographic developments and the positive economic environment.The annual rate of increase in residential mortgage lending slowed to 21% in April, the lowest rate of increase since August 2002.  On the other hand, the rate of non-performing loans remains low, as does the level of repossessions.  In line with these trends, the rate of house price inflation has slowed.  The level of house prices are now back to the same as those in August 2006.The main factor impacting on the housing market is the rising interest rate environment.  This is impacting on affordability and hence on the demand for housing.  Eight quarter-point increases by the European Central Bank over the last 18 months have doubled the key official interest rate for the euro area from 2% to 4%.While property price increases have moderated, the cumulative increase in house values in recent years puts first-time buyers at a distinct disadvantage.  Those who are already on the property ladder have benefited from those increases in value and have built up their own property market equity.  First-time buyers do not share in their good fortune and our proposals are designed to help them as they compete with existing owners and investors in the property market.  In effect, the measures for which this Bill makes provision will level the playing field for purchasers by directly helping those who come to the property market without the advantage of the house price appreciation of recent years.  It will also level the playing field between new and second-hand houses and widen the choice available to first-time buyers with clear social benefits.As a result of the existing stamp duty regime, first-time buyers are incentivised to buy new homes which, in many cases, are considerable distances away from their families and support networks.  The changes that this Bill proposes will make first-time buyers indifferent between second-hand and new homes and will remove an existing financial obstacle to establishing their own homes in the neighbourhoods and communities in which they grew up.  This has obvious and desirable social benefits, which flow directly from the provisions of the Bill.Leaving aside the equitable and social impacts on the first-time buyer, our proposals are good for the property market as a whole because they will bring an end to the speculation and uncertainty about the evolution of policy in this area.  In addition, by making these changes retrospective on transactions executed on or after 31 March, we have minimised the potential for market disruption.  Where a person who has paid stamp duty becomes entitled to an exemption from that duty when the Bill is enacted, he or she will be entitled to claim a repayment of that duty from the Revenue Commissioners.  The latter will, in due course, publish details of how a claim to such a repayment is to be made when the Bill becomes law.We want to see the output of new housing remain strong in the interests of purchasers, construction workers and the wider economy.  We recognise how important the construction industry is to our success.  It directly employs 280,000 people across the country and many tens of thousands of others in related industries.  It is a major contributor to the health of our public finances.  A strong construction sector is vital to a strong economy and is in everyone's best interests.Let me be clear regarding my position on stamp duty reform.  First, what I have been saying is that, as Minister for Finance, I could not speculate on the specifics nor could I say what I would or would not do because the market reacts to what the Minister for Finance says.  Second, at all times I made it clear that I would do nothing that would disrupt the market, not that reform of stamp duty could not take place.  Third, I indicated that if people wanted to have an idea of how I would be thinking, I asked them to examine the two initiatives I had brought forward in this area in previous Finance Acts, both of which were exclusively for the benefit of first-time buyers.It is generally accepted that speculation in recent months about stamp duty has had a negative effect on the market.  Such speculation was not of my making.  In dealing with the situation as it evolved, I was obliged to handle it in a responsible manner in light of the extra attention drawn to comments of a Minister for Finance in this area.  The proposals before the House to introduce stamp duty reform with retrospective effect will restore stability and certainty to the market.The Bill contains two sections.  Section 1 provides an exemption for first-time owner-occupying house buyers and for the repayment of stamp duty where it has already been paid in respect of instruments executed on or after 31 March 2007.  Section 2 is simply the Short Title and construction of the Bill.We have planned further measures to support those who are about to buy their first homes or who have done so in recent years.  Our policy initiatives are designed to help young people and young families, not just those who are about to buy their first homes but all those who have purchased apartments and houses in the past seven years.  They will improve affordability, reduce the burden of higher interest rates and have a positive social impact.  Our initiatives pass the test because they are socially fair and economically appropriate, they support those who need State support most, they will eliminate uncertainty and they will support and protect our construction industry.I do not doubt that I will be asked why I am not introducing other types of stamp duty reform at this time.  The answer is simple, namely, I am doing what the Government said it would do in the programme for Government.  I am exempting first-time buyers from stamp duty in respect of all houses, regardless of whether they are new or second hand.  In doing so, I am removing any uncertainty regarding the stamp duty regime which may have arisen among house buyers during the election campaign.Taken together, the measures in the Bill, combined with the mortgage interest relief measures in budget 2007 and those proposed for 2008, provide real and tangible benefit to first-time buyers as they seek to purchase a home.  I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment.  It is somewhat ironic that his first action will be to preside over the unnecessary guillotine that is being applied to the Bill.  The latter is to some degree a measure of arrogance that has been evident in the Government since its re-election.  I again congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his election and I look forward to very fair rulings from the Chair during his stewardship.The origins of the Bill are deeply cynical.  It is not six months since the Tánaiste, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, informed those buying houses that reform of the stamp duty code was not justified.  Less than four months ago he voted down reforms designed to extend the thresholds at which stamp duty would apply to first-time buyers.  Sadly, many first-time buyers took him at his word.  I have received e-mails and letters from people who paid stamp duty of between €25,000 and €27,000 before 31 March last, confident in the belief that the Minister for Finance would stand by the word he gave at budget time.  This legislation will do nothing to cater for the needs of such people, who feel deeply let down.  The Bill is not part of any thought-out Government strategy aimed at helping those who are disadvantaged in the housing market or bringing stability and sustainability to the market.  This deeply cynical exercise is an example of the naked political ambition of Fianna Fáil, which wants to stay in power at all costs.  Fianna Fáil housing policy has not helped disadvantaged people within the housing market and it has not created a stable market.  Where is the equity in the Government's provision in this regard?The Government is masquerading, like a wolf in sheep's clothing, as the defender of first-time buyers.  I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Shea, remembers that the Government added €40,000, in effect, to the cost of a house for a first-time buyer.  It increased VAT by 1%, added development charges, abolished the first-time buyer's grant and introduced the Part V site cost under the planning Act.  This Bill does nothing to alleviate such extra costs, which are being paid by first-time buyers.  The only first-time buyer of a new house who will get anything from this legislation is someone who is buying a new house in excess of 125 sq. m.  I see no reason the taxpayer should be asked to dish out money to the buyers of such houses.  This change is not needed in such cases and cannot be justified.  It will do nothing to relieve the burdens faced by many people who are buying homes.I would like to examine briefly the Government's housing record over the past ten years.  House prices have increased by 200% as a result of the Government's mismanagement of the land bank market.  The Central Bank, which is not exactly a centre of radical thinking, has claimed that half of the population cannot afford the payments on an average house.  The Central Bank is not a left-wing think tank.  The Government promised in the national development plan that 11,000 social and affordable houses would be built on foot of public investment on public land.  Just 6,000 such houses — barely 50% of the target that was set to benefit the most disadvantaged people in the housing market — have been delivered under the Minister and his colleagues.  The so-called Part V provisions were supposed to ensure that one in every five houses built on private land would be a social or affordable house.  One in 40 houses built on private land falls into that category, however.  Less than 2.5% of houses privately built last year were deemed to be social and affordable houses under the so-called planning provision.The strategy of the Government in the housing sector has imploded.  Public policy is undermining the position of first-time house buyers.  The circumstances of people who are forced to rent their homes are little better.  Some of the poorest families in the community are forced into the rental market because they cannot afford to buy houses.  The princely subsidy they receive from the Minister comes to just €13.85 a week.  That is the total subvention paid to people with low incomes who live in rented accommodation.  That people who are unemployed get a further subvention is another example of a poverty trap that is built into the Government's housing policy.It is absolutely and certainly true that stamp duty is an unfair tax.  Root and branch reform, rather than the sort of timid changes which are proposed in this legislation, is required in this area.  It does not include any thresholds or sliding scales which would link the benefits received to the ability to pay in some way.  It breaches the requirement that a tax should be fair and equitable, which is one of the so-called canons of taxation.  Perversely, it makes it more difficult for people to move to homes in areas with established schools, health facilities and other amenities.  The schools in my constituency are emptying and many facilities in the area are under-used.  The extent of the huge tax barrier which prevents people with young families from occupying houses in areas with established facilities has increased from €9,000 to €41,000 in Dublin over the past four years.  This perverse tax is damaging our capacity to care for the community efficiently and to use our housing stock effectively.  It is facilitating the headlong rush by developers to build houses in greenfield sites, where buyers will not face stamp duty.  Those who are living in areas where unsustainable development has taken place are facing long commutes.Ireland is characterised by its repetition of the worst mistakes of urban sprawl, as seen in the United States.  The housing policy that is being pursued by the present Government is dysfunctional.  The people who designed the policy have no concept of integrated planning.  The manner in which the Government is approaching its housing policy does not reflect any thinking about these important issues.This unjust tax will continue to apply after today to everyone buying houses who are not first-time buyers.  Who are these people?  Are they property speculators who are entitled to this quadrupling of their tax bill in the space of four years?  They certainly are not.  They are not the property speculators or the super rich, although the super rich still have plenty of tax havens.  These people are ordinary families who want to buy in a neighbourhood with facilities.  They are couples who bought a one-bedroom apartment, now have a family and want to move to a family home.  They are older people who might need to trade down because of diminishing capabilities.  They cannot run a garden or manage the stairs and want to move.  They are people whose relationships have broken up and who need to buy again, but are not deemed to be first-time buyers.  These people are being singled out in this Bill for this sort of tax penalty — a quadrupling in the space of four years.  These very ordinary people are being charged a total of €41,000 on an average house in Dublin.  I see no fairness in that position.Is this part of some grand strategy to stabilise the housing market?  I beg to differ.  I will read a quote to the House which is not from some sore-headed Opposition politician:A strong case can be made that the patterns of settlement, neighbourhood design and density in the past decade are storing up significant social, environmental, budgetary and economic problems in the years to come.  Furthermore, this has been occurring in a context in which there are clear, well-defined, feasible alternatives that are sustainable.The National Economic and Social Council said that — the great and the good of Irish society.  It pinpointed the dysfunctional nature of Fianna Fáil housing policy that has been pursued for a decade.  Nothing is being done to address that situation.  Instead of a proper set of reforms to change the way the housing market operates, we have seen inept interventions which have all had to be abandoned.  The 60% "use it or lose it" capital tax introduced by Charlie McCreevy went within a year, while the penal code for investors went within a couple of years.  These were inept interventions that did nothing for the housing market.Over the past decade, Government policy has fostered a chronic imbalance in the housing market.  It has created a contrived scarcity of development land, driving the price of development sky high.  It has failed to reform a dysfunctional planning system that sees new homes built without schools, public transport and health facilities.  It has encouraged unsustainable one-off housing on cheaper land, free from any development levies — the contrary to the sort of policy we should be pursuing to try to create a compact way of living.The legacy of this policy is clear — excessive house prices, unaffordability, a new poor and a sector bloated by high profitability.  The Minister talks about the indication that the housing market is in great shape.  It is being driven by house prices that are too high.  It is commonly believed that houses are overpriced.  The volumes are excessive and unsustainable in the long term and, as Davy noted, in the next two years, we will see house completions go from 95,000 down to 65,000.  This will have an impact on Exchequer revenue and employment in the construction sector.  These are the indicators of a mismanaged housing market, not a well-managed one, and not surprisingly——

It is part of the chronic arrogance of the Government that it is guillotining such a motion.  The whole policy in this area needs change.  I defy anyone on the other side of the House to give me any convincing reasons to believe that the housing market has been managed competently by the Government.  All the indicators are to the contrary.  Sadly, the very bloated nature of the housing market and the excessive prices that people must pay are undermining our competitiveness.  As a small open economy, we depend on being able to trade.  One of the reasons we are running into difficulties is because the Government has mismanaged a crucial market that is important to maintaining competitiveness, namely, the housing market.  I see no indication in any of this legislation that there has been any thinking about either the equity or the efficiency of the way in which we intervene in the housing market.  A lot of change needs to happen before we could say we are doing anything for either fairness or stability in the housing market.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	423	Last year information given out before the budget stated first-time buyers paid up to €70 million in stamp duty, of which €66 million was on properties costing less than €635,000.  The Bill's provisions grant absolute relief to all first-time buyers, regardless of the size of house purchased.  Last year, the Progressive Democrats put forward proposals to abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers but restricting it to houses of 1,300 sq. ft. or less, a sizeable three or four-bedroom house.  The Fianna Fáil proposal contains no restriction on the size of property.  It is, therefore, of particular advantage, as are most Fianna Fáil proposals on housing, to the well-off.  It will benefit wealthy first-time buyers and, mainly, those with wealthy parents who can contribute up to €500,000 in the purchase of a first-time home without involving themselves in capital acquisitions tax difficulties.   There are several taxes that apply when wealthy parents transfer properties to children.  This measure is tilted at the better-off while the number of ordinary first-time buyers who will benefit will be limited.I have received several representations from home-buyers who have lost out on the refund deadline of 31 March 2007.  A couple — a teacher and a garda who bought before the deadline — informed me it was unfair that those who bought between the budget and the deadline will receive nothing from the Bill's provisions.  They pointed out they bought in the same market conditions and political climate but that the cliff-like all or nothing impact of the deadline has created a chasm of complete winners on one side and losers on the other.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has attempted to justify his U-turn on stamp duty as being appropriate.  On the Monday before the general election was called, I recall the Minister on "Questions and Answers", stamping the table saying he was the Minister for Finance and that stamp duty would not be changed.  The Minister made the false representation to many young couples that they could be sure the moves made in the budget would be the market conditions that would apply.  People made decisions in good faith on the word of the Minister for Finance to purchase homes.  Solicitors, based on the Minister's claims no change would be made to the stamp duty regime, would have advised clients to proceed with sales.  Many house purchasers who did so before the 31 March deadline have been caught out.Tomorrow, I will offer the Minister a simple amendment.  He could talk about sales concluded in the quarter ending 31 March.  That at least would restore some fairness to people who believed, in good faith, what Deputy Cowen had to say, as Minister for Finance.  People relied on his reputation as Minister for Finance and on what he said in that role, and they and their advisers then acted to their detriment because they believed him.  I should expect the Minister to have some sense of obligation to those who acted in that fashion.  It was not an unreasonable thing for them to do, following what he had indicated when he spoke as the Minister for Finance on this issue.  All Members of the House understand the politics of the situation, and that he was overruled by the Taoiseach.  The two of them then came to a political agreement.  Part of Deputy Cowen's reward subsequently was to become Tánaiste——

The defence of that position in his speech is not acceptable to reasonable people who acted in good faith on the advice contained in the statements he made.  In the recent Finance Bill, on foot of amendments tabled by the Labour Party, the Minister agreed that abuses of stamp duty were taking place in regard to licensing arrangements, whereby developers and builders were entering into agreements for the purposes of avoiding stamp duty.  The Minister introduced amending legislation in the Finance Bill for which he was complimented, but he has not brought it into force, so that all the avoidance mechanisms continue merrily while the couple who might have bought an apartment and need to buy a house because they have a family, are caught in the stamp duty trap.

We are especially concerned for those young couples on average incomes who are over-borrowing for overpriced houses and are being forced to place themselves in extremely vulnerable positions, given that further increases in interest rates are already signalled.Therefore the key question for us in determining if we can support the proposals contained in this Bill is whether they will make housing more affordable.  Sadly, these changes will most likely end up by increasing prices and making houses even more unaffordable.  This has been the impact of previous changes.  This reality is the main reason the Department of Finance advisers have been so reluctant to support proposals to reduce or remove stamp duty.A 2005 paper by advisers to the Government's tax strategy group concluded that there would be no guarantee that changing stamp duty rates or increasing thresholds would benefit principal home buyers because “there will be, most likely, some consequent increase in house prices”.Sinn Féin, therefore, cannot support this legislation.  Sinn Féin recognises there are flaws in the current system of stamp duty and we are therefore open to reform.  However, we cannot support changes that will have the effect of making houses even more unaffordable for first-time buyers while giving most benefit to those wealthy enough to be purchasing their first house at the top end of the market.  If stamp duties for first time and principal home buyers can be reduced to assist those on average incomes without pushing up house prices and making them more unaffordable, then we would propose taking such steps.  For example, if reforms involved changes to the stamp duty thresholds or changes whereby stamp duty would only apply to value in excess of the threshold and were accompanied by price controls in the housing sector, this might have the desired result.Our bottom line is that we will support whatever policy instrument will be most effective in ensuring that people, especially those on low and average incomes, can access the house of their needs.  Sinn Féin has proposed ring-fencing a proportion of stamp duty receipts for further investment in social housing provision.  Given that Sinn Féin genuinely wants to help would-be first-time and principal home buyers, we have proposed, in place of these stamp duty changes, a number of measures to reduce investor-led demand and, therefore, house price inflation.  Sadly, looking at the statistics, it is indicated by the Irish Banking Federation that only about 2,000 of the 38,000 first-time buyers in 2006 had to pay stamp duty.  Clearly, therefore, the Government's measures will only benefit a very tiny and, most likely, well-to-do section of the population.

I welcome the Bill, which more than fulfils an election commitment, particularly the introduction of an extra month of flexibility, extending back to 31 March.I am distinctly puzzled by Deputy Burton's argument.  If I heard her correctly, she talked about a television debate on the Monday before the election was called.  If so, she is referring to late April and I do not understand how that could have influenced people to miss the new deadline of 31 March.I welcome the level playing field in respect of newer and older houses.  The Tánaiste made the very cogent point in his speech that this should reduce the need for people who want to avail of the incentive to have to commute from new houses.  Bearing in mind the maintenance of the older housing stock, certainly at this stage of our development, there should not be discrimination between new and old.This is a very short debate but the issue was debated ad nauseam during the election campaign.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19826	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	432	It sounds like the Deputy agrees with the Opposition.

I cannot think of a single poverty group that mentioned the subject of stamp duty and it was hardly raised once in several months in the part of the country I represent.  It was raised more recently but only by somebody who has a child in Dublin.  I am not saying that a problem that pertains only to Dublin should not be addressed.It is important to note that there are many anomalies wherever there are thresholds.  There are many thresholds in the social welfare system, including for eligibility for medical cards, yet enormous emphasis was placed on stamp duty.  Stamp duty is projected to raise €3.9 billion, or 8% of revenue.  We do not have property tax in this country and while there is a case for reform it should be carried out with caution.  I deeply deprecate the fact that stamp duty was debated in a context divorced from that of the budget.  Stamp duty is like excise duty in that if one starts speculating on it in advance, it affects market behaviour.  That has caused problems and I hope in the future stamp duty changes will be firmly in the context of the budget, not outside it.It has been suggested — I am willing to listen to argument on it — that concessions should be made to encourage older people to move to smaller accommodation.  Older people have seen an enormous appreciation in the value of their houses.  It would take a lot to convince me that those who would perhaps benefit from such concessions would represent the best way to forgo revenue.  We should look at this closely — I expect to hear this from so-called "left-wing" parties — in the context of equity in this debate.

More than anyone else, Dr. Twomey was responsible for the very clear positions our party took up in the course of the recent campaign.  He was a forceful parliamentarian whose presence will be missed in the House.  I recognise the contribution he made as our party's spokesman over the past two and a half years.Tonight and tomorrow night Fine Gael is asking Dáil Éireann to stop the most controversial plan to affect Irish health care in a generation.  Handing over public land to private, for-profit hospitals does not have the support of the people and will serve to further entrench the two-tier health system which currently prevails.  After ten years in office, the only big idea advocated by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats — now supported by their allies in the Green Party — is to hive off public landbanks at knock-down rates to private developers at considerable cost to taxpayers in taxes foregone.  It is not a plan for patients but one which introduces unnecessary competition onto the grounds of our public hospitals.This is not an experiment which can be altered.  When the plan is up and running there will be no going back.  It came not from the wishes of the people but from the wishes of Government without any consultation.  There was no Green Paper, detailed cost-benefit analysis, Dáil scrutiny or accountability.  The decision was foisted on public hospitals and the HSE because the Government decided it would look at only one option to provide additional bed capacity in the system.  The effect of the policy in the years ahead is plainly foreseeable.  Public and private hospitals on the same sites will be pitted against each other in direct competition.  While some facilities will be shared in the interests of patients, they are not the ones who will gain most from the experiment.  Under the new system, two hospitals will co-exist on each site with two types of patient, one public, one private.  Competition between patients for limited intensive care beds will apply.  Key medical personnel will be lured from public hospitals to private hospitals.  New co-located private hospitals will pick and choose the procedures they offer.  The new model represents a nightmare scenario for our health care system and it should be resisted by all right-thinking Members.Last Saturday, the board of Tallaght Hospital in my constituency of Dublin South-West decided, as was inevitable, to proceed with a co-location plan.  The decision followed many months of bullying and threatening behaviour by the HSE which warned that Tallaght Hospital would have to pay for some of the costs associated with the project if a positive decision was not reached.  Faced with the real needs of patients for increased provision of beds on any terms, the hospital bowed to the inevitable.  Like those of other hospitals, the board of Tallaght Hospital had no choice.Just as there was no mandate for the radical shift in policy after the 2002 general election, no mandate for the co-location policy was produced in the most recent general election.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats lost nine seats.  The PDs lost 75% of its Dáil seats and the Minister's vote in her constituency of Dublin Mid-West fell by 7%.On what basis does the Minister believe she has a mandate to continue with this policy?  At least 84 members of this House had clear unequivocal positions against co-location during and prior to the recent election campaign.  Fianna Fáil did its usual thing by stating one thing nationally and bad-mouthing the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, locally over the policy.  However, I did hear the Minister put on record, in a recent radio interview, that this policy was and is Fianna Fáil policy despite the distancing of some members.We are less sure about the position of the Green Party, which wrestled with its conscience on co-location and decided a review would be the price-tag for its participation in a Government where it was surplus to requirements.  Even this major concession of review won by the Greens does not kick in until 2011, long after the damage will have been done.  It is difficult to review a decision to enter into a 60 or 70 year lease.  We need to know in the context of this debate how many co-located hospitals are to be built.  The PDs states it is 11 hospitals while the Green Party states it is seven or eight after which its much heralded review will apply.  Will the Minister be clear in her reply as to what exactly is Government policy on the number of sites to be advanced for co-location?Two weeks ago, in this House, the Minister for Health and Children suggested my party and its leader had indicated a willingness to support her co-location plans in discussions she had with Deputy Kenny prior to the formation of the Government.  I want to put on the record of the House that there is no basis for this suggestion, if it was made.  Fine Gael never expressed support for the proposal to sell public land for private hospitals as the Minister proposed.  What we were prepared to do was examine how improved public services, including beds, could be provided using the private sector to build new facilities.Tonight, I want the Minister to put on record her view on whether Professor Drumm fully supports the Government's plans on co-location.  His comments at a recent health summit, as reported in The Irish Times, highlight a clear difference between the stated position of the Government and that of the HSE.  He stated on that occasion, “The co-location project, in terms of running the health services in Ireland, is not a significant issue for me”.  The CEO of our health service stated it is not a significant issue for him.  He further stated:My job is to run the public health service...We were asked to facilitate Government in terms of handing over sites and making sure that we got proper economic payment for them, but once that's facilitated then it really has nothing to do with us going forward.This seems an extraordinary statement given the importance of the policy and its implication for the health service.  Professor Drumm is not an irrelevant backbencher.  He is the person responsible for co-ordinating the reform programme and moving ahead on many key issues in our health service.  Did the Minister ever ask Professor Drumm to submit his views in writing or for his formal position on the issue of co-location?  If so, I want her to publish it without further delay.  A cloud is hanging over whether Professor Drumm and his colleagues in the HSE support this radical policy announced by the Minister and her colleagues.Many Deputies asked the Minister to publish a cost benefit analysis on all aspects of this proposal.  If this work has been completed, why did she decide not to publish the analysis in full?  During the recent election campaign we saw the sorry spectacle of three senior Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, show an alarming lack of knowledge regarding the financial cost of co-location.  Eventually rescued by a party official, they looked like the three stooges, seemingly unaware of the real cost and the likely financial implications.  Before any contract is signed I want the Minister to tell the House the full lifetime cost for each co-location proposal.Will the Minister guarantee to the House that all details of co-location including public private contracts will be open to public scrutiny?  There must be no secret deals on public land and no secret deals with taxpayers' money.  I do not want to hear that certain deals cannot be published on the grounds of being "commercially sensitive".  This is not a matter for the HSE but for the Dáil and, ultimately, for the Government.  These are public lands which are being offered as part of a tax wheeze.  The public has a right to know what is going on and the terms of each of the contracts.  Will the Minister guarantee to the House that she will publish the names of the beneficial owners of any successful consortium?  I want that commitment in the House this evening.Patient safety groups have legitimately raised concerns over the ownership and control of the newly proposed co-location private hospitals.  The question must be asked how well prepared we are to police against fraud and what new measures are to be introduced to counter the threat of fraud in this sector.  While HIQA can investigate complaints, what does it take to start an investigation?Will the Minister tell the House exactly what land bank will be left after co-location on each of the sites and the proportion this represents on each site?  It is crucial that a significant amount of land is set aside for the expansion of additional public facilities on the grounds of these hospitals.  One wonders how we can ever build the necessary number of respite beds when such an amount of land is being handed over for private hospitals.  Will the Minister guarantee in each case that the full commercial value of the land being leased is assessed by independent valuers?Does the Minister intend publishing a new legislative basis for this arrangement?  Is she proposing any form of registration or licensing system for the operation and governance of these new hospitals?  Will a scoring system apply in each of the bids so that we can know exactly how these bids were won?  The Minister should set out how the HSE proposes to assess the capacity of each consortium to provide quality medical care to patients and how they propose monitoring their capacity to do that on an ongoing basis.We know from the debacle over Eircom some of the unforeseen consequences of privatisation.  For example, will a successful consortium be entitled to sell the co-located hospital to a third party whenever it wishes?  There is also the question of insurance.  Will any insurance liabilities accrue to the State from the operation of these hospitals?  Specifically, who will be responsible for the medical insurance of doctors operating within this hospital system?It appears likely that some hospital consultants, working in public hospitals, will be investors or will have some financial interest in the proposed co-located private hospitals.  Does this not lead to a risk of a serious conflict of interest?  How does the Minister propose to deal with such a potential conflict of interest?  Furthermore, what protocols does she propose to put in place to ensure that complex, difficult and expensive cases which arise in the co-located private hospital will not be transferred to the public hospital?  What does she intend to do in respect of long-stay patients where a serious medical difficulty arises following treatment in a private hospital?  Can the Minister make clear what level of regulation of patient safety there will be in the new co-located private hospital?Throughout this process, the Taoiseach and the Minister have frequently stated that the co-location option is the best and quickest way to deliver more hospital beds.  Both say it is much faster than the public sector.  They seem to forget they have been in Government for the past ten years and we still do not have the much heralded 3,000 acute beds promised as far back as 2001.Let us put this issue of the failure to deliver quality public services directly at the door of the Government, which has been in office for ten years.  Since it has failed to deliver the necessary hospital beds, it has selected a quick fix solution which has potentially devastating long-term consequences for public health.  There is no evidence, nationally or internationally, to support the contention that investor-owned private hospitals are more efficient than public hospitals.  It is the continuing failure of the Government to deliver a proper system which requires a majority of our citizens to take out private health insurance.  The same people, who have seen the cost of their health insurance double during the past ten years, will be asked to pay up for this untested model of care.The motion tabled by my party represents a real litmus test for the Government.  I appeal to those Members who said unequivocally before the general election that they opposed this measure to take a stand tonight and tomorrow and vote against the Government on this issue because once we go down this route there will be no turning back.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for sharing his time in this important debate.  It is fundamentally misguided to premise the country's health care system on ability to pay and to locate the private commercial investor at the heart of health care provision.  A commercial "for profit" hospital care regime will only serve to reinforce the two-tier health system in this country.  In recent times the ethos of the Irish public policy has moved away from the Berlin social model towards the Boston economic model as espoused by the Government and in particular the neo-conservatives who form the Progressive Democrats.  We have witnessed the disposal of the some of the State's key assets in a range of sectors, particularly in communications, and the health services are now the next item for sale in the Government's determined rush to privatisation.The philosophy that ability to pay should guarantee better services in health is in line with the mantra of the Progressive Democrats that inequality in society is good and necessary.  However, market economics have little or no place in the health sector and in the delivery of health services.  People do not choose to get sick and those who do fall ill should not be punished or disadvantaged for not having the means to avail of private health care.  Our health service should be based on fairness, equality, justice and meeting the needs of the sick and ailing in society.  We should be looking to the models of our European neighbours, many of which have excellent public health services.  The United States is no beacon of inspiration in the area of health care.  Its health care regime is elitist, expensive and fundamentally inequitable.Our priority must be the provision of primary health care for all, the improvement of accident and emergency services, and the tackling of MRSA and other new super-bugs appearing on the scene.  Instead, co-location has been elevated to cornerstone status of our health care policy at the expense of other vital services.  It is ironic that the fundamentally undemocratic nature of hospital co-location reflects the fundamentally undemocratic reality whereby the one party that preached co-location more than any other was almost eradicated in the recent general election.  There is, unarguably, no electoral mandate for co-location and yet it is now the policy of the Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and Green Party Government, and has received the belated support of a number of Government-supporting Independents.  Such a volte-face by parties that opposed co-location before the general election does little to strengthen the belief of our citizens in politics and the political process.If hospital co-location goes ahead, it will result in a cherry-picking of patients from public hospitals with the consequence that public hospitals will lose out as vital moneys currently paid by insurance companies will not now be available for the public sector.  This can only lead to falling standards in public health care and further demoralisation of health care workers who, across a broad range of health care vocations, already feel under threat and siege from the Government.  The number of groups within our health care system that have a grievance with the present Minister grows on an almost weekly basis.  A demoralised health care sector does not bode well for the future.This country is now at a crossroads on health policy.  If we do not cry halt to the relentless privatisation of the State's assets there will be little left when this already discredited Government leaves office.  The Government is happy to take in billions of euro in taxpayers' money every year and ignore the basic concept of fair play in hospital care.  Failure to invest in our geriatric services continues to force the elderly into private nursing homes and a further programme of "for-profit" health care is planned for community services.  The Government was given a message by the people in the general election when 75% of the Minister's colleagues were unceremoniously removed from office.  The Government ignores this message.  Fine Gael is not willing to stand by and let the wishes of the people be trampled upon.I endorse the comments of my senior colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, in proposing the motion.  The Minister should change her mind because this proposal is fundamentally unjust and unfair.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	454	It is proposed to build one of the co-located facilities at Cork University Hospital in my constituency.  I am opposed, like my colleagues, to this poorly thought-out measure, which is being hailed as the solution to our health care problems.  It proposes to deliver 1,000 additional beds to the system and, while they are badly needed, they should not be provided in the way proposed by the Government.  The Opposition parties proposed to increase the number of hospital beds during the recent election campaign and the accident and emergency department task force highlighted the need to increase the number of acute hospital beds, but this should not be done in the manner proposed by the Minister, which is to sell public lands to develop private hospitals.  The beds are badly needed but not at the price of giving away public land, which is valuable both economically and in the context of its location.  This land will be lost forever to the expansion of public health care facilities and developments that could be proposed in this regard.Will the Minister explain why the Government cannot build badly needed public beds and convalescent and step-down facilities on these sites to relieve pressure on hospitals and the accident and emergency department system in particular?  The current system works well but it needs to be resourced and supported by the Government.  The level of private care in our hospitals needs to be limited and, while such care has a role in our health system, the Minister should not give away public lands to provide additional beds.The Minister needs to clarify the cost of her proposal because the electorate is unsure.  Various figures have been bandied about and it has been estimated the proposal will result in €500 million in revenue foregone to the Exchequer over seven years, while the cost of private health care is estimated to increase by 40%.  A total of 52% of the population avails of private health care.  Private health care has a small but important role but public facilities need to be supported and developed.  A stroke victim, a diabetic or a patient with a heart condition needs continuing care, which can only be provided through the public system.  Private health care will deliver hip replacements or cataract procedures that can be bought through the National Treatment Purchase Fund but continuing care needed by those with long-term illnesses can only be delivered effectively by multidisciplinary teams in public hospitals.I have spoken to many workers in the medical profession about this proposal.  Doctors and consultants, particularly those who have worked in the United States, are very concerned that the State is going down the American route.  As Deputy Charles Flanagan said, this proposal represents a watershed.  Is the Government going down the Boston route or the Berlin route?  It should examine how our European neighbours support their health services because we do not want a scenario where doctors make decisions based on the cost of a procedure rather than on its medical benefit.I have spoken to members of the INO who are concerned that if a private hospital is located adjacent to a public hospital, nurses will leave to work in the private hospitals because working in a public hospital is very difficult.  Anybody who has spoken to nurses involved in the recent strike knows they are concerned about the pressures on their profession.  In particular, they are concerned about the pressures they have had to absorb and that people are leaving the profession on a daily or weekly basis.  That is not good for nursing.There are many concerns and many questions have been left unanswered about the proposed co-location system.  I would like the Minister to again consider her proposals and not move forward with them.  It is certainly not the way we want to move forward in our health care system.  She should restore confidence to those working in the system and would-be patients.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, on raising this important issue tonight.  He made an extremely good maiden speech on the health issue for which I applaud him.There are many questions raised with this issue.  What is the elected mandate in respect of it?  As has been stated, the Minister's party has diminished considerably since the proposal was first made.  I notice the Green Party, given all that its members have said in recent weeks, is conspicuous by its absence.  I can only think of how Deputy Trevor Sargent would have spoken tonight if he was still on these benches.  He was very vocal on the issue but his party now seems to have rolled over.I attended a press conference this morning in the Earl of Kildare Hotel with people from counties Donegal, Carlow and Kilkenny among others who are extremely worried about the co-location and privatisation issues.  When one considers the documentation provided for us at the press conference, showing who the people behind these issues are and the type of matters in which they have been involved in the USA, one must ask major questions.  For example, how much research or knowledge is available on the matter?  Is the Minister fully aware of the background and once again willing to turn a blind eye?  Issues in which some of the companies have been involved certainly raise many questions.  Why should we hand over taxpayers' hard-earned money, or more accurately, offer tax breaks to such persons?It is extremely important that the economic and medical justification for this plan be clearly outlined to patients and taxpayers.  As I understand it, the Department of Health and Children has not undertaken a detailed and comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to justify it.  If it has, it is time the Minister published the analysis and made it absolutely clear from where the benefits will come.I spent a few short days in the neurological section of Beaumont Hospital last year.  I have previously stated in the Dáil that it does not take a genius to uncover the problem.  We did not need the Teamwork group report from England or to make any trip to the USA to know that the one issue causing problems for nurses, consultants and everybody else in Beaumont Hospital was not the lack of theatres but the lack of beds.  If one had looked out the windows of the hospital, he or she would have seen green fields where buildings could have been quickly constructed to house beds.  Any company could build a hotel in a few months; why, therefore, can the Health Service Executive not build facilities to provide extra beds so as to release pressure and allow patients to be operated on?I know I am not a genius but I could see patients in beds for weeks on end through no fault of a surgeon.  Things go wrong but there should be a place where these people could go to allow operations to go ahead and the system to move forward.  It is not difficult to provide step-down beds.  However, there is a proposal to provide a brand new privately-owned hospital in the grounds of Beaumont Hospital with the offer of the gift of tax breaks to some individuals from the USA or elsewhere who have many questions to answer in their own right.I cannot help but mention the issue of Monaghan General Hospital.  It is clear that the Minister has an agenda to wind down the operation of small rural hospitals and small hospitals elsewhere to provide the so-called need for this private group of hospitals.  I have heard people from County Donegal say that they have been told they cannot have cancer treatment services in Donegal but when it is proposed that a private enterprise would provide the required service, there is no problem in delivering it.We must get real.  We must make sure that money is used properly in this area.  We must also ensure that proposed investors from outside this country are fully checked before they enter this market to ensure that we will not be caught out as we were with Eircom and others.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	456	It is important first to re-emphasise to the Minister that 58% of the electorate voted against the proposal to co-locate private hospitals on public hospital land.  Why did they do so?  Perhaps it was because they realised this is a very expensive way of providing public beds.  The tax base will cost up to €500 million.  The loss of revenue from private patients may cost up to €700 million.  How is the shortfall to be addressed in the public hospital system, not to mention the loss of valuable land that was put aside to accommodate the future expansion of public hospitals?Furthermore, there is the matter of the haemorrhage of medical personnel, both doctors and nurses, this proposal is likely to cause from the public to the private system, and the likely increase in the cost of insurance, as the need for profit encourages more investigations and tests.  When profit becomes the bottom line, patient care can only suffer.Given the existing dependence of some of the newer private hospitals on the National Treatment Purchase Fund to keep them afloat and the assumption that this will continue and possibly increase, does this imply continued starvation of the public health system so that the taxpayer pays twice for treatment?  Evidence from the  New England Journal of Medicine reveals that outcomes for patients treated in for-profit hospitals are not as good as those in not-for-profit hospitals.This measure will do nothing to address the two-tier system in our hospitals, it will only further entrench it.  It does not make increased provision for the training of junior doctors and does not address the need for rehabilitation and continuing-care beds in the community.It is important to note that Ireland remains one of the lowest investors in the area of health.  A total of 7.2% of GNP was spent in the area of health last year while the average spent in other EU member states was 8.6%.  Germany and France spent in excess of 10% of GNP and the United States of America spent 15% of GNP.I have heard other Members mention the American system and the argument that our system is closer to Boston than to Berlin.  There is no doubt that we should be concerned about what has happened in America where those on the lowest income are looked after by the state while those who can afford health insurance are catered for.  However, a rapidly expanding number of Americans, up to 60 million according to some experts, have no health insurance, and for them illness represents financial ruin.  That is something we must avoid here.Furthermore, because health insurance is so expensive, employers in America buy health insurance from HMOs.  This has resulted in a situation where neither the doctor nor the patient has any say in who treats who.  In other words, the doctors are tied through their contracts with the insurers and they must treat patients who have a contract with that insurer.  The patient is tied to the provider organised by the employer.  Therefore, if an employer changes his or her insurer, a patient who has been attending a doctor for 20, 30 or 40 years, suddenly will no longer be able to attend that doctor unless the patient pays for the visit, the cost of which is prohibitively expensive.To recap, 18,000 beds were provided in our hospitals in 1983, today only 13,000 are provided yet 500,000 more people live here.  Patients still spend three or four days on a trolley in accident and emergency departments while waiting for a bed and they have to wait for years to see a consultant.  It was disingenuous to formulate waiting lists on the basis of the length of time people have to wait for treatment after they have seen the consultant.  This does not take account of the length of time — in some instances, up to three or four years — it can take before one sees a consultant.  Patients provided me with letters they received from their local hospitals which indicated that they would be obliged to wait for such lengthy periods before obtaining appointments to see specialists and go on waiting lists.In light of the points I have raised and in view of the total lack of clarity surrounding the plan, I ask the Minister to reconsider and to deliver to the hard-pressed public health system the remainder of the 3,000 beds the then Government promised to provide in 2002.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	457	It is my pleasure to support the motion.  As Deputy Brian Hayes outlined, there is a series of problems and failings in the Government's proposals regarding the process of co-location.  The decision to proceed with co-location amounts to little more than acceptance of the failure of Government policy in respect of the health service during the past ten years.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children stated on previous occasions — they repeatedly did so prior to the general election — that co-location is the cheapest and fastest way to bring about the provision of the badly needed hospital beds they promised in two programmes for Government.  However, they have not acknowledged that co-location amounts to a failure on behalf of the State to provide, as ought to be the case, hospital beds through the public system.It is disappointing the Progressive Democrats is giving up, as is clearly the case, on the prospect of achieving a competitive environment in the public sector and in the delivery of public health care.  As Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney is, in effect, CEO of the health service and, as such, is culpable and responsible for this grave failure in the delivery of public hospital beds and of an effective and efficient health service.In the aftermath of the general election, it is clear that there is no mandate in respect of the proposals relating to co-location.  The Green Party — none of its members is present in the Chamber, which is extremely disappointing — campaigned against co-location, as did the Independents who are propping up this Administration.  In my constituency and in many others across the country, Fianna Fáil backbenchers campaigned against co-location——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	458	That is correct.

However, they have since been bought off with additional junior Ministries and have suddenly become silent on the matter.The Government has shown itself to be bereft of ideas on how it might reform the public sector and deliver public hospital beds.  It has resorted to taking the easy way out by handing over responsibility for the delivery of urgently needed acute hospital beds to the private sector and providing the latter with tax breaks that are unquantifiable.  Figures relating to the amount of taxpayers' money that will be spent on the tax breaks that will allow developers to build on public hospital grounds have not been laid before the House.I wish to comment on the decision taken by the Government on the aspects of the public health service that function.  In that context, I refer to the example of St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar, in my constituency, which has been consistently rated as the best hospital in the country and which is being shut down by this Administration as it proceeds to hand over responsibility for the delivery of acute hospital beds to the private sector.  There is a huge contradiction in that regard.  What is happening is extremely disappointing.  It highlights the lack of imagination and creativity on the Government benches in dealing with the crisis in the health care service.The Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Independents will sell out on the most vulnerable people in society, namely, those who are currently on long hospital waiting lists and who do not have the advantage of private health care insurance.  These people will fall to the bottom rung in a system that will prioritise private development and private health care.  The need for public beds to be delivered was acknowledged by the Government in 2001 and again during the term in office of the last Government.  That it has failed to deliver on its commitment to deliver 3,000 extra hospital beds is an indictment of the current Administration.  I hope the voices on this side of the House which were so loud before the general election will be heard again to ensure that the co-location proposal does not proceed during the life of this Government.

We have ring-fenced 2,500 beds, which have been fully funded by the taxpayer, for the exclusive use of private patients.  Does anybody in this House think that is fair?  Is it right that we should say that the 2,500 beds which have been provided at the expense of taxpayers can only be accessed by patients with insurance or self-payers?  The State pays the nurses who look after the patients in those beds and provides the diagnostic equipment and administrative backup that they need, but it does not allow people to access such public beds unless they are insured patients or self-payers.  In implementing this policy, I am trying to provide that 1,000 of the 2,500 beds in question can be used by public patients.I wish to comment on what will happen when the co-located hospitals are completed.  I will talk later about the six hospitals that are involved at the moment — I have the figures in respect of them.  The board of Tallaght Hospital agreed unanimously last week to proceed with co-location.  The board was not bullied by the HSE.  It was asked to decide whether it wished to proceed.  I received the approval of the Government for this policy in July 2005.  Since then, no hospital has been forced to propose any project.  It has been open to individual hospitals to make co-location proposals if they wish to do so.  A number of hospitals have done that.  I understand that the board of James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown will shortly make a decision on whether it wishes to proceed.  That will bring the number of hospitals involved in this process to eight.  I am not aware of any further hospitals in this regard.  We set out to convert 1,000 private beds for public use.  When the co-location facility is in place in all those hospitals, every public bed will be accessed on the basis of medical need and on no other basis.  There will be no preferential treatment in the public hospital system for insured patients or self-payers.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	470	The co-located facilities will have to provide 24-hour admission.  That will be a new feature of private hospitals in Ireland.  They will have to train doctors.  Deputy Reilly said they will not train doctors, but they will have to do so.  Their profits will have to be shared.  If debt is being refinanced, public hospitals will have to benefit too.  We will not have the situation that arose with a toll road recently, whereby a company got a contract that proved to be extremely lucrative 20 years later.  Taxpayers will not be forced either to buy out such a contract or to assume the losses involved.  That will not happen under these proposals.I was interested to hear the maiden speech of Deputy Reilly, whom I congratulate on being elected.  However, until recently, Deputy Reilly was a strong advocate of tax breaks for health provision.Deputy Lucinda Creighton, whose election to the House I welcome, represents a constituency with a co-located facility, St. Vincent's Hospital.  I am sure she is not suggesting that we should not have that hospital in her constituency.  In respect of St. Luke's Hospital, all the expertise in Ireland and overseas indicates that stand-alone radiation is dangerous for patients and that one must, as Deputy Deirdre Clune said, integrate multidisciplinary care, with medical oncologists, surgical teams, pathologists, radiologists and radiation oncologists all working together in the interests of the patient.  What is happening is that the radiation facility is being provided at St. James's Hospital.  While the actual physical facility in terms of the hospital will remain there, it will probably do different things or may be for overnight patients.  The treatment will be multidisciplinary and integrated because that is what patient safety requires.That brings me to a point made by Deputy Seymour Crawford.  My policy and that of the Government is to provide treatments for patients as close as possible to where they reside, provided it is safe to do so.  In my view, patients in Ireland, like patients anywhere else, do not actually care how the facility is funded or who runs it.  One need only talk to the many people who use the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  What they care about is the quality of the treatment and the speed at which they can get it.  That is what is important.  Above all else, if somebody is sick or a member of his or her family is sick, he or she wants them to be able to access the best treatment as quickly as they can.Deputy Brian Hayes asked me a number of questions.  We will publish details in respect of each site.  When that happens, the board of the HSE will meet on 5 July and I think at that point will select the preferred bidders on each site.  Among the people who have come forward — the assumption here is that they are all people from outside the State — are the Bon Secours Group, which has a terrific record of health care in this country for many years; the Mater Hospital; and Mount Carmel.  These are hospitals with a terrific track record so we should not assume that people in the independent sector in Ireland are not interested in getting involved in this as well because they are.All the details in respect of each site, including the financing, will be a matter of public information.  In respect of the costs, I heard a figure of approximately €700 million quoted here.  The insurance foregone in respect of the six hospitals at the moment will be approximately €80 million.  This is less than half the cost of running those beds.  In respect of the site, no site has been given away.  All of them will be leased at above the market value.  There has been independent valuation.  Many people and bodies have been involved in this, including the National Development Finance Agency, the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, the HSE, Farrell Grant Sparks, Prospectus and internal auditors.  For each individual site, this project has gone through a procedure in terms of public procurement that we have not done in health care in Ireland before.  All of the services being provided in this facility will be integrated with the hospital, which does not happen at the moment.  Private hospitals emerge, are not integrated with the public system and do not necessarily complement the public system.  This is different.  What is being provided at each site is what each hospital wants.  If patients do not have private health insurance, the hospital will be obliged to provide services procured by the HSE for these patients at discounted prices.Lastly, in respect of the tax foregone, the maximum amount is approximately €455 million.  The cost of providing these beds in the traditional way would be at least €1 billion.  I think that is pretty good value for money.

Professor Drumm is right.  His job is to run the public health care system.  My job, as Minister for Health and Children, is to preside over a health care system to which everybody can have access.  The issue concerns us getting private providers to provide services, like the National Treatment Purchase Fund does, which is not under the remit of Professor Drumm.  Not all matters are under the remit of HSE.  Professor Drumm's job as chief executive of the HSE is to run the public health care system.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	481	That is quite astonishing.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	482	After the general election debate, in my view the co-location policy has emerged without a dent and without damage.  That is because its central objective has always been, and remains, to free up publicly funded beds for public patients.  The co-location initiative will achieve 1,000 new public beds faster and more cost effectively so there is better access to acute hospital services for all public patients.Every Government has a mandate and a responsibility to consider and implement new initiatives in the public interest.  This Government does and the former Government did also.  It would be short-sighted for a Government to refuse to countenance any new idea in the public interest on the grounds it had not been spelled out in black and white in a party manifesto or a programme for Government.  This would mean a Government had to close up shop for five years at a time on all new thinking and innovation.  New ideas should always be welcome if they can be shown to serve the public interest and fit with the strategic objectives and policies of the Government.The former Government sought and received a mandate for the 2001 health strategy which spoke of developing a strategic partnership with the private sector for the development of health services.  It stated the private sector makes an important contribution to service needs which must be harnessed to best effect for patients and that a strategic partnership with the private sector will be developed in providing services for public patients.I brought forward the co-location initiative in July 2005 on the basis that it was a new idea, consistent with Government policy, which would serve the public interest by freeing up more acute hospital beds more quickly for public patients.  That was the basis on which my colleagues in Government endorsed it from the start and on which we continue to support it.  The policy initiative has been brought to the point of implementation by the HSE.  I am pleased to see our ideas are working out in practice and our objectives for public patients will be achieved.In all publicly funded hospitals, private beds sit alongside public beds which are not routinely available to public patients.  For many years, this has given rise to unfairness and inequity right in the heart of our publicly funded hospitals.  These beds are heavily subsidised by the State, perhaps by as much as 50% of the running cost, yet they are not routinely available to people without health insurance or who cannot pay themselves.  The co-location project will mean publicly funded beds in these public hospitals will always be available to all patients in order of medical need.  This is a major advance in achieving equity in our public hospitals.The initiative will free up designated private beds at each site.  It will also mean that public beds will no longer be used for fee-paying private patients, as routinely happens.  More beds will be freed up than the number of designated private beds because the designated private bed ratio is exceeded by private activity in many hospitals.  In Tallaght hospital, it came to 46% of the elective work in 2005.  The precise number of freed-up beds will be set out by the HSE when it shortly completes the tender process.In service terms, this means there will be no cherry-picking in the provision of health services.  Co-located facilities will be required to treat all private patients in public hospitals.  The only exception will be where the HSE excludes certain activities on national health policy grounds, such as accident and emergency, radiation oncology and organ transplantation.  All of us, regardless of whether we have private health insurance, are entitled to be treated in a public hospital as public patients.The new private hospital beds will also be available for use for public patients, subject to service level agreements being put in place.  As part of the capital allowances scheme, the new hospitals will have to offer services at a discount to the HSE.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has opened up access to private hospitals for public patients.  I am confident this will also be possible with the new facilities adjacent to public hospitals.  For example, if a bed is needed for a public patient awaiting admission at an accident and emergency department and all public hospital beds are full, those beds in a private facility can be used for his or her admission.  This will shorten waiting times for admission for public patients.There will be only one accident and emergency department at each public hospital campus in which every person will be seen in order of medical need.  There will be no public and private distinctions and the new facilities will not be allowed to operate parallel accident and emergency departments.In this, and in other matters, the initiative has built-in concrete protections for the public interest.  In financial terms, the health care benefits must justify the costs, but in a way that is better value than under the traditional procurement methods.A public sector benchmark, PSB, equivalent has been created for each site.  The calculations include, for example, the cost of tax allowances and the foregone income earned heretofore by the public hospital from private beds.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, is financial adviser to the Department of Health and Children for this co-location project.  The NDFA wrote to the Department yesterday to confirm that, in its opinion, the tenders provide value for money relative to the PSB equivalent at the current stage of the procurement process and that the project is in a position to move to the financial close stage.The precise cost and benefits of each project depends on the financial profile of each of the successful bids.  The HSE board is to meet on 5 July to approve the award of successful bids.  In general, as regards costs, I can say the following.  The capital costs to the State of the new public beds will be the value of the capital allowances used.  This is necessarily less than half the actual construction cost, since relief would be claimed at the marginal income tax rate applicable at the time.There is no validity to any objection that the new facilities will be built to too high a specification, that is, at a level that could not be justified in the public sector.  First, the capital allowances scheme applies to only certain construction costs for new hospital facilities — consultants' suites are excluded, for example.  Second, any over-specification would count as a negative in the evaluation, since the comparison with the equivalent cost under traditional procurement would show up excessive construction capital allowance costs. Third, the HSE has stipulated certain requirements in relation to the physical appearance of the new facilities, so that they fit with the existing public hospitals.The capital allowance costs to the State will only come on stream after the new facilities have opened — from about 2011 onwards — and they will be spread over a seven year period.  For every €1 million in allowable investment, the gross tax cost to the State would typically be €455,000 at current tax and PRSI rates, spread over seven years, without taking account of tax buoyancy from the activity generated.  The actual expected capital allowance costs have been included in the financial evaluations by the HSE and the NDFA and are being submitted to the board of the HSE.The current cost includes foregone income to the public hospital from private bed charges that will be no longer available.  I understand this is under €80 million a year at the six sites.  This is far less than the actual running cost of these publicly-funded beds.  To offset the loss of this income, the State will receive: leasehold income from the land; a profit share from the operator of the new facilities; and a share of re-financing gains over the lifetime of the project.  However, it is wrong to isolate this net cost of achieving new beds, without comparing it to the cost of running similar new beds under traditional procurement.The average running cost per bed in the six sites is around €350,000 per bed per year.  The running cost of 1,000 new, similar acute public beds at these sites, if procured in the traditional way, would be about €350 million.  The net annual cost to the State of the new freed-up public beds will therefore be considerably less than the running cost if new public beds were procured in the traditional way.I would further point out that detailed requirements are in place to ensure that there is integration between the public and private facilities.  Some of these will be new for private hospitals.  Before co-location, it has not been possible for the public side to make any requirements of private hospitals in regard to some of the following.  For example, teaching and training of junior doctors will take place in the new facilities.  The new hospitals will have to be capable of admitting patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from both accident and emergency departments and direct by GP referral.  They will be required to facilitate a research culture that increases research activity and contributes to staff development and retention across both hospitals.  They will report on activity to the hospital inpatient inquiry system and they will report to the performance management unit of the HSE.Some public hospital consultants will be able to work at the new co-located facilities under the planned "Type B" contract, but it is our policy that new management methods will be in place to ensure an appropriate mix of overall activity on the site on the part of public contract holders.  I expect these matters will be specified and finalised in the course of resumed contract discussions.The co-location policy was drawn up as a means of increasing capacity in major public hospitals in innovative partnership with the private sector.  It is fully in line with European trends, where public and private sectors are working in innovative ways, according to local conditions.  An invitation to tender has been issued for a project at James Connolly Memorial Hospital with a deadline of 6 July for submissions.I am pleased also that the board of Tallaght Hospital has now joined the boards of St. James's and Beaumont in seeking a tender.  I do not believe any of these public interest boards would have done so had they not been convinced of the benefits to patients at their hospital campuses.I am confident this initiative will command growing public support, beyond the majority already in favour, especially when the new facilities are up and running.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I join the Minister, Deputy Harney, in congratulating the newly elected Members of the House who are present this evening.  I welcome back the Members who served in the 29th Dáil and wish them well during the life of the 30th Dáil.As the Minister stated, the provision of private health care is a long-established feature of health care provision in Ireland.  It involves a wide range of health practitioners and health care facilities, including general practitioners, dentists, pharmacists, chiropodists, private nursing homes and private hospitals.  It has historically complemented the public health care system.  This Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity in the health system.  The key objective is to provide the required extra capacity, be it by the public or private sector.A number of Government policies and initiatives support the co-existence of public and private health care.  These include the designation of private and semi-private beds in public hospitals; income tax relief on private health insurance premia; income tax relief on medical and dental expenses; the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund; and capital allowances for investment in the development of facilities such as private hospitals and nursing homes.As the Minister stated, there are more than 13,000 beds in the 53 public hospitals.  Some 2,500 of those beds, or approximately 20%, are designated for use by the private patients of consultants.  However, the level of private elective admissions, that is, planned rather than emergency admissions, to public hospitals is currently running at approximately 35% of the total.  This impacts consistently on the ability of public patients to gain access to public hospitals.It is Government policy, as stated in the programme for Government, to implement the plans for the co-location of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals, thereby freeing up beds for public patients.  The co-location initiative was founded on the principle that all patients ordinarily resident in the State should continue to have access to public hospitals.  However, access should be based on medical need only and possession of private health insurance should not influence how quickly one gains admittance to public hospitals or the treatment one receives when one is in a public hospital.The development of private hospitals on the campuses of public hospitals is all about improving access for public patients to beds in public hospitals that are currently used by private patients.  The idea is to migrate private patients from public hospitals to co-located private hospitals and thereby free up capacity for public patients and ease pressures on public waiting lists and accident and emergency departments.  The private patients of consultants on the co-located sites will transfer to the new co-located private hospitals.  Co-location-type arrangements have existed for many years at both the Mater Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.  The arrangement appears to have operated satisfactorily from the perspective of both public and private patients.Co-location is the quickest and least expensive means of improving access for public patients.  No capital outlay is required as the beds are already in place.  In addition, the beds are already staffed and the backup services and facilities required to support them are in place.  There will be a loss of income to the hospitals from private health insurers.  This is a small price to pay in order to provide 1,000 beds for public patients.  This loss of income will be mitigated, in part, through income the hospital will obtain from leasing the land to the private co-located hospital.The co-located hospital will be capable of treating all of the private patients that are currently in the public hospital.  The private co-located hospital will take patients from the public hospital's accident and emergency unit who require to be admitted and who have opted to be private patients of the consultant.  The private co-located hospital will accept direct admissions to wards or to medical or surgical admission units from primary care centres and general practitioners 24 hours per day.  The private co-located hospital will assist in improving access to research, development and teaching.  It will be a separate legal entity and will assume all legal and operational risk.The new competitive dialogue procedure, which became effective in February 2006, was the procurement process used for the project.  On 23 May 2006, the HSE published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union inviting expressions of interest for the development of co-located private hospitals, the provision of associated hospital facilities and the provision of certain medical services on 11 public hospital sites in Ireland.Following an assessment of the expressions of interest, the HSE pre-qualified a number of bidders in respect of ten sites.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, was removed from the process due to the review of hospital configuration in the north east.During the next stage of the process, the HSE engaged in competitive dialogue with the short-listed bidders with a view to identifying the hospital's core requirements, a service delivery model for each individual site.  A number of bidders withdrew from the process for a number of sites for commercial reasons.  This resulted in no bidders remaining for Letterkenny General Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.Based on the assessment carried out by the HSE, a set of minimum requirements was developed for each site.  Such requirements prescribed a minimum threshold to be achieved in respect of the minimum service delivery model to be provided by the co-located hospital on each of the sites.Between May and June 2006, the HSE issued pre-qualification questionnaires to all parties that expressed an interest in tendering.  The HSE received responses from interested parties and undertook an evaluation of those responses.In September 2006 the HSE issued an invitation to the successful candidates to participate in dialogue following the pre-qualification process.  The invitation to participate in dialogue constituted a formal invitation to bidders to enter into a dialogue process with the HSE on the project.  The pre-qualified tenderers submitted outline proposals to the HSE which it evaluated.Subsequently, an invitation to continue in dialogue was issued to short-listed bidders, who were selected under the evaluation criteria set out in the invitation to participate in dialogue to be invited to continue in dialogue with the HSE.  This document also set out details on the requirements for each hospital at each site and the criteria that would be used to evaluate tenders.Invitations to tender for St. James's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Sligo hospitals issued on 19 April 2007.  The invitation to tender for Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, issued on 11 June 2007.  The board of Tallaght Hospital agreed on 22 June to continue its participation in the initiative.The bids for the six sites were returned on 17 May 2007.  Each bid was scrutinised by the HSE compliance team to check whether it conformed to the invitation to tender and whether it met the minimum requirements.  All bids that satisfied the assessments for conformity with the requirements of the invitation to tender and met the minimum requirements were evaluated by the project evaluation group by applying the award criteria set out in the invitation to tender which was originally formulated on the basis of the policy direction issued by the Minister on 14 July 2005.  These criteria covered value for money, financial sustainability, governance framework, service delivery, protecting the public interest, quality and innovationThe HSE will appoint the successful bidders in respect of St. James's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Sligo hospitals at the beginning of July.Public procurement process requires that there is a standstill period of two weeks following notifications to successful and unsuccessful bidders before agreements can be signed.  Successful bidders will have to apply for planning approval and undertake detailed design work.  The entire process has been subject to the review and approval of an independent process auditor separately appointed by the chief executive officer of the HSE.Establishing value for money in respect of this project has been a key objective of the HSE throughout the process.  This was achieved by ensuring the bids received were able to satisfy value for money assessment criteria and also ensuring the financial offers received were better than the market value of the land to be leased to the successful bidders.  The Government is committed to improving access for public patients to hospital care.  It is not about who provides the service, whether public or private providers, but rather the range of services provided and their capacity to meet the needs of the population, their quality, the safety of the patient and the efficiency of the services provided.Private patients of consultants have priority access to public hospitals at the expense of public patients.  As the Minister outlined, she intends to give early effect to commitments in the programme for Government to ensure greater equality in access and care between public and private patients.  The interests of public patients will be protected and promoted through the co-location initiative.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I wish to respond to what the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, said and I am sorry she is not in the House.  In her reply to the Fine Gael motion she took the opportunity yet again to promote myths and I regard it as important to put the record straight.  She referred to Professor Drumm and stated she had never heard his view on this project.  I quote him:We have to be extremely careful that we do not drive through the front gates of our hospitals and find the road to the left to the nice flowered structure with a fountain in front where those who can afford it go to that structure and someone else goes sheepishly in the other direction towards the HSE hospital.That is precisely what will happen if there is co-location.  With regard to Professor Drumm and the approach adopted by the Minister, I have written to her asking her to explain on what statutory basis she issued the directive to the HSE in 2005 to proceed with co-location.  Serious legal issues are involved in her failure to reply to me.  I again ask her to explain exactly what is the statutory basis for her directive to the HSE.The Minister promoted another myth when she said her position was to provide beds and care as close to home as possible.  There are 1,500 beds to be provided under the programme for Government, but the bulk of them, 1,000 beds, will not be provided as close to home as possible; under the scheme they will be provided where money can be made.  It should be remembered that 1,500 beds is far short of the 3,000 which the Government considered necessary and well below the broad figure of up to 3,000 which the ESRI has given.Another myth promulgated by the Minister this evening was that Tallaght Hospital was not bullied.  We all know that it was, unless the Minister has some strange view about what undue pressure means.  Tallaght Hospital needs 200 extra beds but it has not a chance in hell of getting them, unless it succumbs to the demand from the Minister and the HSE to go for co-location.  I call that bullying, as would any reasonable person, but the Minister still comes into the House and promotes a myth.The Minister refers to accident and emergency departments where there will be two streams.  The money will follow the insured patient which will ensure patients with private insurance will be able to fast-track access to the care they need.  This is the way of the world and the way it happens.  It is another myth to presume that somehow things will be different in accident and emergency departments; they will not.The Minister promotes the myth that private beds in public hospitals are solely used by private patients but this is not true either.  They are certainly used by insured patients but private single rooms are also used to protect patients from the spread of hospital infections such as MRSA.  They are also used for patients who are dying.In one hospital, it was estimated that 40% of private beds were used for purposes other than to provide for insured patients.  The Minister once again speaks as if private patients will go only to private hospitals, but that is not true either.  Every patient in the State is entitled to attend a public hospital, and many of them will choose to stay there to gain access to its broad range of care.  They may have to do so, but they may also choose to do so if they so wish.  It is one part of the two-tier health service that we will see worsen rather than improve under this Government of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party.The final myth is that private institutions such as St. Vincent's Hospital and the Mater Hospital started on the same basis as the new co-locate hospitals.  Unless the Minister does not grasp the difference between a religious order and a for-profit corporation interested only in making money for its shareholders, she has deliberately muddied the waters instead of telling things as they are.  That is surprising, since the Minister's reputation would suggest otherwise.  Then again, many of us know better.I congratulate Deputy Brian Hayes on his election to this House and his successful elevation to the position of his party's spokesperson on health.  I regret the loss of former Deputy Twomey, who did an excellent job.I forgot to mention that I would like to share my time with Deputy Higgins.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	486	It is usual to congratulate a new Minister for Health and Children at the start of a Dáil, and I am more than happy to wish Deputy Harney well on her return to what is clearly a demanding post.  However, I also wish that she would take some time to reflect.  As a Deputy who saw her party decimated, she will understand that it has suffered most cruelly at the hands of the voters.  Is it too much to ask that she learn some lessons from that experience?One of the most contentious issues of the last election was the privatisation of the health service.  That was spearheaded by the Progressive Democrats and adopted by Fianna Fáil; now it has been embraced by the Greens.  However, as this motion outlines, that policy did not win majority public support in the election.  The co-location of private hospitals on public lands is the most pernicious and extreme example of the Minister's determination to hand over significant elements of the Irish health service to the private sector.The Minister has promoted herself — and members of her party promote her — as courageous enough to take on vested interests in health care.  However, the curious thing about that claim is that her definition of vested interest extends only to doctors and health care workers.  Far from being taken on, the predatory interests of the for-profit developers have been feather-bedded by the Minister to an extraordinary degree.To be strictly accurate, that trend began before the Minister's appointment, but it was during her period of Cabinet influence.  When a constituent approached the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, and asked for a handout, he received it in the form of tax relief on a private health facility.  More handouts to the private sector followed the extension granted via the Finance Act 2002.However, it was Deputy Harney who issued an instruction to the HSE in 2005 to facilitate the handover of scarce public lands to private, for-profit developers who would benefit from generous tax breaks.  No analysis was ever carried out, no debate initiated, and no cost or health impact assessment conducted.  That decision was ideological, but I once again note the Minister of State presenting it as a cheaper and quicker way to provide the desperately needed beds that the Government promised in its health strategy but never delivered.The truth is that co-location is not cheaper and not necessarily quicker than providing public beds.  There is a real cost through tax breaks.  The cost is estimated at €70 million for seven years, which is almost half a billion euro.  It has been estimated — our figures were based on Department of Finance ones — that one could provide around 1,200 public beds for the same money.  There is a serious cost in the loss of income through insurance to the public hospitals.  This cost in revenues forgone to public hospitals as a result of co-location is estimated to be €145 million per annum and possibly as much as €200 million per annum.  There is a cost in the loss of public lands.  We are all aware of the inflated cost of land at present.  It is a finite resource and most sensible people would consider it folly to hand over such a scarce public resource in this way.  There is a cost in the duplication of services and facilities because of an unnecessary fragmentation of provision of two structures on the one site.  Private patients will be asked to pay the full economic cost of their care in the co-located hospitals and that will lead to a steep increase of at least 40% in their current private health insurance.The Department of Finance, which one would expect to be very forthcoming in its support of this, in its memorandum dated October 2006 expressed serious concerns about the cost of this policy in terms of the loss of trained staff.  Later on it expressed concerns about the soaring cost of private insurance and also about the failure to assess the land value issue.The other argument of speed of delivery is similarly flawed.  Mr. Tom Finn of the HSE claimed it would take 16 years to build a public hospital.  That really tells us something about attitudes in the HSE and in regard to how the Government approaches this area.  The reality is quite different.  In Wexford General Hospital, 21 hospital beds were provided within 12 months.  As soon as the hospital got the go ahead, it delivered the beds within 12 months.  I was in Letterkenny General Hospital and an entire cancer oncology department was provided in 18 months.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware of this but systems of construction on a modular basis can provide new facilities extremely quickly.  However, that is not the kind of news she wants to give.  She would prefer to give us the myths.The Minister sent the order to the HSE in mid-2005.  It is now 2007 and not a contract has been signed.  According to the memorandum from the Department of Finance, it would take at least three years to provide these hospitals.  Now the Minister is talking about 2011.  That is hardly a fast track process but what is worrying — I referred to this earlier — is that the entire process may be tested in the courts if a developer is not accepted and feels hard-done-by.I wrote to the Minister on 1 June asking for clarification on the statutory basis of her policy direction and I am still waiting for a reply.  In the letter I pointed out that, in relation to the status of a ministerial direction, its subject matter must relate either to the Health Act 2004 or some other enactment and the subject matter must concern some matter or thing which the 2004 Act states is to be specified or determined by the Minister.  I wrote that I would be grateful if she would let me know, as a matter of some urgency, how the letter of 14 July 2005 is believed to meet both of these two conditions — the second one in particular — in other words, in what specific way does the co-location of private hospitals on public hospitals' sites amount to a matter or thing in relation to which the Minister has a power under the Health Act 2004 to make specifications or determinations and so derive a power to issue directions under section 10.  I am still waiting for that reply and it is important we get it.  I would appreciate it if we could get it before this debate ends tomorrow night.We have an example of private investment in the public health service which is called Beaumont car park.  The Comptroller and Auditor General produced an entire report on the car park at Beaumont Hospital.  If we had a system that served the public, the car park would generate income for the hospital.  Instead, it generates income for private developers while its cost of construction was €13 million more with tax breaks than it would have been had the State built it itself.  I fear we will end up in the same sorry mess but on a grander scale on foot of Deputy Harney's folly.There is no doubt we will see a different approach to patients in for-profit hospitals.  We will see procedures carried out that are quick and make money.  Nothing the Minister does will change that basic difference between a for-profit hospital and a public hospital established to be dedicated to patient care.  Because of the different ethos, cherry-picking will occur no matter what requirements the Minister introduces.  To point that out is not to criticise the profit motive, but rather to state a fact.  We will see a very different form of bed to the kind that exists for private patients in public hospitals currently.  It is not a question of comparing like with like.  However, the perverse incentives that operate in our two-tier system currently will be transferred to the new model.  The fact that the incentives will operate in two-different locations on one site will not make a blind bit of difference.  The money following the patient is the key and that will only apply to insured patients of whom there will probably be fewer as the cost of insurance is to rise as the Department of Finance has pointed out.  There will be no empowerment of public patients whom money will not follow.Given the problems in our public hospitals currently, it is scarifying to see the budget limits being set.  Crumlin, Temple Street and the Mater Hospitals are suffering.  The budget the HSE provides is not keeping up with demand.  The experience of many years tells us that when hospitals reach the limits of their budgets, they simply close down services.  They close wards and stop appointments, which are phenomena we may well see happen again.  The danger is especially acute given the ending of the stream of income to public hospitals which has come through insurance.  When the insurance money ceases, public hospitals will become completely dependent on the HSE whose budgets even now are failing to keep up with medical inflation, the demands of a growing population and increasingly expensive new technology and treatments.  The two-tier system creates difficulties not alone for patients but for doctors in the context of medical ethics.We must acknowledge the most pernicious aspect of the Minister's proposal.  At a time when we have the resources to create a good quality health service for all the people, we have a political outlook which is determined to create conditions in which future integration of the health service will be far more difficult than it is currently.  While integration represents a difficult challenge, it is the policy most Irish people would prefer.  Had they the option, they would choose a service in which people were treated equally and with respect and dignity over the divided system we have currently.  However, we are not to be provided with that.  We will have what Professor Drumm outlined at the beginning.  We will see the return of the old dispensary style of health care.  It was formerly the case that the dispensary provided a poor-quality, undignified service for those who were too poor to go privately while the general practitioner provided for private patients.  It was Erskine Childers, a Fianna Fáil Minister, who changed all of that.  We now have a Fianna Fáil Government reintroducing and exacerbating a two-tier system in our hospital service.  The dispensary model will now be the HSE public hospital where people will be treated in a markedly different way to what happens in a private hospital.  This serves the patients extremely poorly and the excellent staff we have across the board in our hospitals are extremely disenchanted by the approach adopted by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.In many ways one feels a certain sense of despair that the lessons which were presented in this election in terms of people who voted for an alternative view to co-location have not been heeded.  We have back in place a Minister who simply does not listen to the people and this is most regrettable.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting the issue of psychiatric services for debate.  I feel honoured this is selected as the first matter for an Adjournment debate in the 30th Dáil.I call on the Government and the Minister for Health and Children to reverse the decision to move the Central Mental Hospital to a site adjacent to the new prison at Thornton Hall in north Dublin.  The Government must respect the human rights of people with mental illness.  To locate a therapeutic facility for people with mental illness, many of whom have not committed a crime, beside a prison is stigmatising and discriminatory.Not alone has this proposal been roundly rejected by the families and carers of Central Mental Hospital residents, voluntary organisations, the Mental Health Commission, the clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital and the Human Rights Commission, it also flies in the face of the core values and principles enshrined in the report on mental health services, A Vision for Change, which the Government proposed to accept as its policy.Central to the treatment process for patients at the Central Mental Hospital is the aim to overcome the stigma arising from criminalisation which, in most cases, is an accidental effect of their mental illnesses.  Other key objectives include the rehabilitation and reintegration of patients into mainstream mental health services when it is appropriate and safe to do so.  None of these objectives would be helped by placing the Central Mental Hospital adjacent to a large, high-profile prison.In his letter to the Taoiseach, the clinical director at the hospital stated, "the proposal is about as bad an idea as it is possible to imagine".  The director, Dr. Kennedy, is strongly critical of the fact that he was not included in plans to move the Central Mental Hospital and that he only learned of the developments through the media.  There is an urgent need for a new hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital.  This has been recognised for a number of years and should have been acted upon at a much earlier stage.Dr. Kennedy is insistent that the new hospital should be located beside a general hospital.  He stated 200 secure psychiatric beds are needed to end the situation in which prisons are used as psychiatric waiting rooms and are equivalent to accident and emergency department trolleys.  The case for revisiting this decision made by the previous Government is compelling and I call on the Minister for Health and Children to do so immediately.One of the key issues which must be dealt with in regard to mental illness is the challenge to de-stigmatise the one in four people who will suffer from such an illness during their lifetime.  Those who suffer feel stigmatised by attitudes and views from a time when psychiatry was not as developed as it is today.  Society must address its attitude to those who at some stage suffer a psychiatric illness.  The siting of the Central Mental Hospital adjacent to the new prison complex reinforces the prejudices and misunderstandings that many people have about mental illness.  The stereotyping of mentally ill patients will allow people to continue to discriminate against those who are suffering.  We must rise above this approach.  The Government must do so by reversing its decision on the siting of the Central Mental Hospital.  It should give leadership in attempting to educate people who do not understand the pain of mental illness.  Only then will people come forward and begin to admit the pain of their illness and seek solid mainstream help.  Then and only then will we demand action from Government to acknowledge the scandal and neglect of the psychiatric services.  Until there is a watershed in societal attitude many will hide their illness.A recognition of the need to change the decision to locate the Central Mental Hospital would play a key role.  Until it is acceptable to be mentally ill as it is to be physically ill we, as a society, will not begin to regard the reality of mental illness as part of our human existence.  Until our everyday language becomes sensitised to the need to eliminate stigma we will not succeed in addressing the need of those who suffer a mental illness.  Anyone can suffer a mental illness.  Anyone can die by suicide.Given the trenchant nature of objections raised by the clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital, Dr. Harry Kennedy, there is a compelling case for the new Government to revisit the decision to site the hospital at Thornton Hall.  I urge the Minister and the Government to do so as a matter of urgency.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter and acknowledge with him the importance of working to prevent suicide and improve mental health.  This debate allows an opportunity to outline to the House the plans for the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital.In May 2006, the Government approved the development of a new national forensic mental health facility at Thornton Hall, County Dublin.  This decision was consistent with a recommendation outlined in A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy which recommended that the Central Mental Hospital should be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up-to-date, humane setting and the capacity of the Central Mental Hospital should be maximised.The new hospital will be a separate capital project, independent of the prison complex.  It will be managed and directed by the Health Service Executive.  The new hospital will be built on its own campus and will retain its identity as a separate, therapeutic health facility.  It will have a separate entrance and a different address to the prison complex.  The cost of developing the new hospital will be met from the proceeds of the sale of the existing site of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.The Health Service Executive has established a project team to progress the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital.  The design of the new hospital will take into account new standards for secure mental health facilities emerging in the UK and Canada.  A new governance structure for the hospital is being finalised at present.The decision to redevelop the Central Mental Hospital is a major step forward in the provision of quality care to prisoners with mental illness.  There has been little or no structural change to the main part of the existing hospital since it opened in 1850.  With the exception of a small, single-storey block built some 20 years ago, it remains essentially unchanged since it was built.  Many of the elements of the building are unsuited to the provision of a modern forensic mental health service.  Like other, unsuitable, older psychiatric hospitals, the closure of the existing facility in Dundrum is the correct decision.  The Central Mental Hospital is the only centre in the State that provides treatment for mental illness in conditions of medium and maximum security.  The majority of admissions to the Central Mental Hospital are from within the Prison Service.Conditions within the Central Mental Hospital have greatly improved in recent years with increased staffing and an end to the practice of slopping out.  Important safeguards for patients have also been introduced by the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 and the Mental Health Act 2001.  The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive continue to strive to improve conditions at the existing facility.However, the existing hospital facility must be replaced.  The report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services stated that the building at the current site is unsuitable for providing an inpatient service.  The Council of Europe Committee on the Prevention of Torture which visited the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum earlier this year was also critical of the current facilities.  Building a new hospital on a new site will open up a range of opportunities for the provision of modern treatment and recreational facilities.  A purpose-built, modern facility, coupled with the required staffing, will offer the best treatment to people requiring forensic mental health services.  I again thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I congratulate the Minister on her re-appointment to the Department of Education and Science and thank her for being here for this debate.  I welcome the relatively slim paragraph in the programme for Government which mentions the applied behavioural analysis, ABA, method for dealing with autism in young children.  I have a particular personal interest in this matter from my family history and have studied it.  A very interesting conference was held in Trinity College last weekend the papers from which I received today.  They are amazing and very thought-provoking.The most heart-breaking aspect of autism is that the child has great intelligence potential which is very difficult to unlock and thus it is very difficult for the child to communicate either with other children or with his or her parents.  The ABA method of dealing with autism supplies the key for unlocking that potential within the child.  Since I opened the Sapling School in Mullingar two years ago I have seen the potential grow within those children.  I have seen them flower both at home and at school.  It is wrong that we have not given the full accolade to such a method of education.  I know of 12 schools that operate on a pilot basis and the programme for Government commits to funding them fully in the long term.  I would like the Minister to outline whether they will have permanent status, which will be important for their buildings.  There are 12 other schools pending.  Will those 12 schools get the funding needed?We all know of the Ó Cuanacháin case, which is costing so much for everyone.  I have met the family to talk about their lovely boy.  The change in him is stupendous since he started availing of the ABA method.  I hope that is not to be snatched from him.  When there is potential, every effort and financial input should be made towards bringing out that potential.I do not know whether the in-built resistance to the ABA method rests with the Department or the Minister.  Knowing the Minister as I do, I do not believe it lies with her.  Occasionally we hear reference to the eclectic method, which is a lovely word which can bamboozle if one did not know what it meant.  However, I would prefer to see a policy that the ABA method would be facilitated if that is the parents' wish.  Those children are precious to their parents and need this method of education to unlock their potential and to attain the status of balanced young adults.

I share Deputy O'Rourke's concern that a blockage is preventing the approval and expansion of ABA schools and that needs to be unblocked.  I am disappointed the programme for Government has not provided as much for education as I had hoped.  The Minister would have invested as much in the sector without any new partner in Government.  I expected more from the Green Party, given the emphasis it put on education in the election campaign and the Government negotiations.  I am particularly disappointed the second tranche of 12 ABA schools has not been given any comfort in the programme for Government.My motion acknowledges that the 12 schools in the current pilot scheme will gain full recognition in time and I hope that will be the case.  Deputy O'Rourke has sought clarification on this, given that there are several caveats.  I am concerned about the next 12 schools and other schools throughout the State that are experiencing a demand for the ABA method of teaching.  Deputy O'Rourke is correct that parents are hugely committed to this method.  I do not cast aspersions on the Minister but one has to see ABA in practice to believe it, as I did when I visited the Bluebell school in Limerick city.  I accept other methods are available to teach autistic children and the ABA method does not work for all of them but it suits a percentage of children.  Parents are willing to go to the ends of the earth to raise money to keep ABA schools going.  The school in my constituency receives no Government funding apart from home tuition grants, which are given to most of the children.  Their parents will do anything from shaving their heads to holding duck races to raise funds.  A local philanthropist who is very kind has also donated money to the school.  Parents will do anything for their children, particularly if they have a special need, and they deserve support.In the long term, these ABA schools will save the State money because approximately 40% of the children who pass through them can enter mainstream schools after a few years of education through the ABA method.  One child who attended the Bluebell school in Limerick will enter a mainstream school in September.  The child will receive support for the first few months but will be then fully integrated into the school population.  ABA is a scientifically based system that has proven its worth.  As Deputy O'Rourke stated, it helps children to deal with the world around them because they cannot relate to the world in the way most other children do.  They need to learn the behaviour that will allow them to sit in a normal classroom.  I have seen children who were taken out of mainstream schools and put into an ABA school before returning to the mainstream school with their behaviour totally changed.A wide variety of initiatives are in place in the education system and it is argued they are working effectively but they do not provide an adequate solution because we need to understand why parents are willing to fight so hard for ABA schools.  This also raises an equality issue.  If the 12 schools on the pilot scheme are recognised, why should children in other parts of the State not have the same opportunity and rights as the children attending these schools?  I hope minds will be open to this.  I am particularly concerned about schools that have been waiting for more than two years for recognition.  Every year those involved must raise sufficient funds to keep the schools going.  It is all very well if parents can afford to fund the schools but if they cannot, their children are denied their rights.  ABA schools facilitate people who cannot afford the fees but, in the long term, affordability is an issue.  Whatever about what was just debated regarding a two-tier health service, we cannot allow a two-tier education service to develop, particularly with autistic children, who are so vulnerable.  I hope we will have a positive response from the Minister.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I thank Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Mary O'Rourke for their good wishes on my election and re-appointment.  I am very pleased to see both Deputies back, as it is always important to have people in the Chamber who have a genuine interest in and knowledge of education to be able to debate the issues of importance.It is significant that two of the issues on the first Adjournment debate concern education.  That shows the interest held by all sides of the House.  The particular topic raised by the Deputies allows me the opportunity to clarify the Government's position on the education of children with autism and the role of applied behavioural analysis, ABA.We are determined to ensure that all children get the support they need to reach their full potential.  I am particularly conscious that the parents of children with special needs are under much pressure and give much dedicated time and commitment to their children.  It is also true that the record of the State over decades in providing for children with special needs was very poor and that we are still playing catch-up.  However, significant advances have been made in recent years, improving the lives of children with special needs and their families.There are now in the region of 17,000 adults in our mainstream schools working solely with children with special needs, compared with just a fraction of that number a few years back.  As well as providing for very significant increases in staff, we have also improved the procedures for accessing extra support with the establishment of the National Council for Special Education.  Parents and teachers now have local special educational needs organisers on the ground to work with them and help them get the appropriate support for their children.There are, of course, significant numbers of special schools throughout the country, which continue to play a very important role, and many of which will be developed as centres of excellence.  They will support mainstream schools and their children.  Over €820 million is being provided for special education in 2007, which is €180 million, or nearly 30%, more than was provided in the 2006 Estimates.  Further improvements in services are on the way with the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the implementation of other commitments in the new programme for Government.With regard to specific provision for children with autism, the Government believes that as each child with autism is unique, such children should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  Applied behavioural analysis, or ABA, is one of the methods used in special classes for children with autism.  The issue of contention is whether ABA should be the only method used in some settings.Advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate inform the Department of Education and Science's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one.  An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish task force on autism, also supports this approach, and autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.  By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.It should be noted that teachers in special schools were using ABA principles more than 25 years ago.  ABA involves the systematic application, at any time during the child's day, of behavioural principles to modify behaviour.  The effectiveness of behavioural interventions to improve the performance of children with autism and to ameliorate behavioural difficulties has been recognised for decades.The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues.  The Department of Education and Science therefore supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.  However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that it should be the only method used.  Whereas ABA helps to improve behaviour, other methods, such as TEACCH and PECS, are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.It is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met.  Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA.  The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.  Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.Approximately 200 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, while more are being set up all the time. There are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants.  Extra assistants are provided where the children need them.  An individual child can have his or her individual SNA if he or she needs one.In regard to the programme for Government commitment raised by the Deputies, the position is that this relates only to the 12 pilot ABA centres that were established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools.The Government is committed to long-term funding for these 12 pilot centres, subject to agreement on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism.  Areas in which standards need to be agreed include the professional qualifications of the staff and the educational programme available to the children.I am pleased to advise the Deputies that, since the launch of the programme for Government, the officials from the Department of Education and Science met the advocacy group for the pilot centres concerned — I met the groups concerned many months prior to that — to progress the implementation of this commitment.In terms of autism provision in other locations, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputies and I thank them again for raising the matter.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	495	The route of the M3 at Tara is very controversial.  It is certainly true that the NRA did not recommend the most important route, which was the one that would least damage the archaeology of the area — I believe it was termed "the pink route".  Nevertheless, because of due process and planning, legal and other issues that were examined at the time, Fine Gael believes the route must proceed and we support it.However, the Green Party has a different view.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, said:We are not willing to lose our archaeological past or give up our sense of ourselves and from whence we come.  The current political mood questions where we are now and the way the Government wants to move forward.  It is bent on building roads and servicing the building industry at whatever cost.  That is its idea of progress.  It is not progress, it is destruction, it is bad transport and social planning and ... it is destroying the essence of our heritage and our ability to understand it.As late as 14 May 2007, Deputy Cuffe, on behalf of the Green Party, said: "The Green Party wants all work on this controversial motorway to come to an end, in particular the massive floodlit Blundelstown interchange."  It is, however, still there and the Minister has not arranged for it to be removed.  Deputy Cuffe continued: "Instead we are calling for the upgrading of the existing N3 Road."  The reality is that the Green Party has betrayed its base.  It has betrayed what its members said no later than 14 May 2007.In its election manifesto, the Green Party was so bold as to say that where there is concern about potential damage to our heritage, it will investigate how this can be minimised within the scope of the contract or by renegotiation.  However, the facts are that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has been on planet Bertie for perhaps only a few weeks and the Minister's sacred site has been visited by the person who held office before him, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, who is quoted as having said that the question of the M3 was discussed.  He said there was nothing underhand about his decision.  He believes it was discussed during negotiations with the Green Party.I ask the Minister, Deputy Gormley, whether it was discussed.  Where does he stand on this issue?  In what position has the Government left him standing on this issue?  Is it not a fact that he has been left to defend the indefensible from his party's point of view?  When the Minister said that Fianna Fáil visits its sacred sites, he said it is in "the tent at the Galway races, where they pay homage to their gods and the gods bestow them with gifts for doing their bidding".  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has done the Minister's bidding.  He has visited the Minister's sacred site and from the Minister's perspective he has allowed to develop something to which the Minister's party is totally opposed. To paraphrase the words of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, "It is a strange place, Planet Bertie".  It is certainly strange and alien to his party's sensibilities.The facts are the Minister has failed at the first hurdle.  His predecessor emasculated the Green Party by going against one of its core values, which was highlighted on 14 May when the Minister, Deputy Gormley, stated this controversial motorway must come to an end.  I call on the Minister to defend himself if he can.

The recent determination of statutory directions by my predecessor, Deputy Roche, arose in circumstances where a national monument was discovered during the carrying out of archaeological works on the approved route of the M3.  The discovery was made subsequent to the approval of the road development by An Bord Pleanála.  Neither that approval nor the environmental impact statement prepared for the scheme dealt with what was then an unknown monument.I first knew of Deputy Roche's directions when I received a text in this Chamber on the evening of Thursday, 14 June.  Neither I nor any of my party colleagues had any prior contact with Deputy Roche on this issue.  On 15 June 2007, following my appointment as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I examined my Department's file regarding the directions given to the National Roads Authority on the Lismullen national monument.  In making the directions in question, the then Minister followed the procedures prescribed under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004.I have received unequivocal legal advice from the Attorney General that, without a change in the material circumstances relating to the newly discovered monument, it is not open to me to review or amend the directions given by my predecessor.  I am aware of media reports in recent days of apparent new national monuments discovered near the site of the national monument at Lismullen.  These were reported to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in early May and I have been informed that they are not regarded as national monuments.  I have asked the director of the National Museum for his advice in respect of these souterrains.The House may be also aware of the recommendation of the director of the National Museum that a special committee should be quickly installed to ensure excavation of the national monument at Lismullen is carried out to the highest and most transparent standard.  This recommendation has been accepted and is referred to in the directions.  The national monuments service of my Department, Dr. Pat Wallace,  director of the  National Museum, the National  Roads Authority and Professor Gabriel Cooney, head of the school of archaeology at UCD, are represented on the committee.  At my request, Dr. Conor Newman of the department of archaeology at NUI Galway, recognised as an expert on Tara, has also agreed to join the committee.  Last week I visited the Tara-Skryne valley with Dr. Conor Newman and Dr. Pat Wallace.

It is my intention to consult in the coming weeks with a wide range of interests in the area to hear their views.  That process started last week and I intend that it will be continued and intensified.It is interesting that the Fine Gael Party has raised this issue this evening.

While my Department does not base its forecasts of Stamp Duty yield for the residential property sector on the number of transactions at the different rates of duty, a breakdown of the 52,901 such transactions in 2006 has been provided by the Revenue Commissioners.This information, based on the consideration value upon which the stamp duty was payable, is as follows:Where the consideration value was between €127,000 and €190,500 there were 10,877 transactions, yielding €52.9 million.For consideration values between €190,501 and €254,000 there were 11,088 transactions, yielding a total of €98.2 million.For consideration values between €254,001 to €317,500 there were 8,007 transactions, yielding €114 million,For consideration values between €317,501 and €381,000 there were 8,600 stamp duty transactions, yielding €153.4 million.For consideration values between €381,001 and €635,000 there were 9,833 transactions, yielding €339.2 million.Finally, in the highest consideration value band, for properties valued at over €635,000 there were 4,496 transactions giving a yield of over €543.1 million.Up to the end of May the Exchequer received €1,438m in stamp duty, which is just €16 million, or 1.1 per cent below profile. This includes Stamp Duty receipts from all headings, including shares, commercial transactions and property. The end-May figure represents an increase of 11 per cent on the same period last year, compared with a Budget day predicted increase of 5.6 per cent for the year as a whole.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	502	As the Deputy may be aware, a full progress report on the Programme for Government between Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats of June 2002 was published in April 2007 and is available on the Department of the Taoiseach website.As outlined in that report, substantial progress has been made on meeting the targets set out in the Programme for Government. In the finance area good progress has been made on all targets. In particular the public finances have been maintained in a healthy condition while delivering dramatic reductions in taxation. Personal and business taxes have been kept low in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy. The budget and economic policies pursued by the Government have helped to generate unprecedented growth in the Irish economy, a spectacular increase in the number of people at work and the effective elimination of long-term unemployment.The new Programme for Government will follow on the targets set out in the last Programme for Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the application of Financial Reporting Standard 17 — known as FRS 17 — that requires annual accounts to show the total accrued value of future pension liabilities in respect of staff.  FRS 17 is applied through-out the private sector and in the accounts of all commercial State bodies.In the public service, FRS 17 does not arise in the case of accounts prepared on a cash-basis.  This includes the Appropriation Accounts for all Departments and Offices covering most of central government.  However, FRS 17 does apply to non-commercial State bodies whose financial statements are prepared on the basis of accruals accounting.  Normally these accounts would show pension liabilities — for example, where there are funded pension schemes.  In relation to pay-as-you-go pensions, with the agreement of the Comptroller and Auditor General, most of these accounts now show an asset to balance the pensions liability.  This reflects the fact that public service pension funding policy provides financing for pay-as-you-go pensions.Ministers have statutory powers to determine the form of accounts of bodies under the aegis of their Departments.  Any specific questions in relation to particular accounts should be addressed to the relevant Minister.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I announced a comprehensive package of measures in October 2005 to achieve better Value for Money on major capital and ICT projects.  As one element of these measures, which are codified in a Department of Finance letter on Value-for-Money of January 2006, each Department and Sponsoring Agency must appoint an individual as Project Manager for each capital project at the planning/procurement stage.  The project manager should be a senior official, including at Management Committee or Board level where appropriate.  It is a matter for each project-implementing Department or agency to determine who should be appointed project manager in each individual case having regard to the scale, complexity and cost of each project.The Project Manager is assigned personal responsibility for monitoring progress on projects against contract requirements and for reporting progress and issues arising to the Project Board. For major capital projects i.e. projects costing more than €30 million, the project manager must also on a quarterly basis submit a progress report to the Department's Management Advisory Committee (MAC) or the Agency's Board, as appropriate, and then to the relevant Minister. If adverse developments occur such as potential cost overruns or delays, the project manager's progress report should include recommendations to address the situation, including if warranted the option of project termination.Furthermore, under the conditions of sanction for capital expenditure issued by my Department, all Departments are required to implement a system of spot checks of projects to ensure compliance with VFM requirements and to report the findings of such spot checks annually to my Department. The spot checks enable compliance with the requirement to have an individual project manager in place to be checked.In terms of accountability, the arrangements accordingly provide for personal responsibility within the overall management framework of the Department or Implementing Agency as regards the planning, management and execution of projects. It is a matter for each Department's Management processes to address issues of individual performance as appropriate taking account of these and other issues.

That said, I do not consider that potential first time buyers are facing exclusion from the housing market.There are several reasons why this is the case. The first is that mortgage interest relief was doubled in the 2007 Budget. Furthermore, the new Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase in Budget 2008 the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first time buyers, from €8,000 to €10,000 for single people and from €16,000 to €20,000 for couples and widowed persons and to keep the rate of relief at 20%.  In addition, this Government has published a Bill which will abolish stamp duty for all first time buyers.Finally, the available evidence indicates that house prices are easing. This, allied with rising incomes in the economy as a whole, should increase affordability for first time buyers.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The commitment in the Government Programme is to use tax credits and bands to keep low income earners out of the standard rate band and average earners out of the higher band.  For 2007, in terms of gross liability to tax before the application of tax credits, the position is that a person earning the average wage, estimated to be about €33,000,  will not face a liability to tax at the higher rate.  This is because the upper limit of the standard rate band for a single person is set at €34,000 in 2007.The aim is to maintain that position going forward.   However, I would point out to the Deputy that the commitment is to be implemented subject to the controlling economic and fiscal framework.  In addition, the Government are committed to operating a responsible fiscal policy characterised by broad budget balance and a declining debt burden.

This figure represents the present value of the liability to make future superannuation payments to serving employees and their dependants in respect of service to date.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund was set up under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. The Act provides for the payment from the Central Fund into the National Pensions Reserve Fund each year from 2001 until at least 2055 of a sum equivalent to 1% of GNP.It is the responsibility of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to invest the moneys in the Fund. The purpose behind the legislation is that the assets of the Fund, made up of the contributions from the Exchequer over the years plus any return that may be generated from the investment of the Fund, would meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 until at least 2055. The legislation provides that no money can be drawn down from the Fund before 2025.As recently reported by the Commission, the market value of the funds in the National Pensions Reserve Fund at the end of May 2007 was €20.75 billion.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	508	I am aware of the contents of the recently published Annual Report of the Information Commissioner.  The Freedom of Information Act, which covered 67 public bodies when it commenced in April 1998, now applies to over 500 bodies across the public sector.  My Department is involved in an ongoing programme of FOI extension and is actively engaged with Government Departments about a number of bodies that remain outside the scope of the Act.In relation to consultation with the Information Commissioner on changes to the FOI Act, it is not the practice of my Department to consult the Information Commissioner in this regard. However, arrangements have been put in place by my Department to ensure that the Information Commissioner is kept informed of legislation impacting on the FOI Act.  The arrangements provide for the Office of the Information Commissioner to be notified by the relevant Department when any FOI-related legislation is published, enacted or commenced.In regard to the fees that apply under the Freedom of Information Act, I have no plans to review these.  I am satisfied that the fees currently in operation strike the correct balance between the burden and cost to the taxpayer of administering the FOI Act and the need to allow access to information.

There were no projects proposed, or approved, by my Department in 2007, the value of which exceeded the €30 million threshold for cost benefit analysis set out in the Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector. I am also informed that neither the Office of Public Works nor the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have had proposals for, or approved, projects in the course of the year to date which exceed the threshold for a cost benefit analysis.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	510	The Programme for Government signals that a carbon tax/levy will be introduced over the lifetime of this Government.  The matter of the introduction of a carbon tax is one of the issues to be considered by the new Commission on Taxation to be established under the Programme.Consequently, at this stage, the precise design of such a tax has yet to be determined. This will, of course, form an important part of the normal deliberative process of the Government in setting fiscal and environmental policy. Deputies will recall, however, that the Programme for Government indicates that the phasing-in of a carbon levy will be on a revenue neutral basis, so it is not intended that its introduction will lead to any net Exchequer revenue increase or net addition to the overall tax burden.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 402 cases were selected for random auditing in 2006. As of 31 March 2007, 187 of these audits have been concluded.  215 cases are ongoing. I am advised that 410 cases were selected for random audit in 2005. 6 cases are still ongoing.   Revenue's approach to random compliance testing changed significantly for their 2005 programme.  The new approach introduced both better design and improved statistical vigour.In 2004, the traditional random audit programme was not carried out due to the change in Revenue's approach following a review of the programme.  However, 25 cases selected under the programme for previous years were completed in 2004.  In 2003, 274 random audits were completed in 2003.  Finally, in relation to 2007, I am advised that the random audit programme commenced at the end of March and 401 cases have been randomly selected.  Internationally a sample in the order of 400 cases is regarded as an adequate sample for the purposes of an exercise such as this.There are two primary objectives to this programme:Compliance measurementTo provide some measure of the effect that Revenue's compliance programmes have on taxpayer compliance over time.DeterrenceRandom case selection ensures that no taxpayer is exempt (or believes himself or herself to be exempt) from the possibility of having his or her compliance position checked.Q. What was wrong with the previous random audit programme? Why was it changed?
I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the previous programme was criticised by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the grounds that the cases selected by Revenue were not actually selected at random. Typically a certain amount of stratification was carried out before the cases were selected and there was subsequent screening of cases at Regional/District level. In other words, cases were not selected on a purely random basis and results could not be used to validate Revenue's other programmes or regarded as representative of the taxpayer population.Q. How are cases selected under the Taxpayer Compliance Testing (Random) Programme?
For the 2005, 2006 and 2007 programmes a total of 400 cases approximately were selected at random on a pro-rata basis for each of Revenue's four regions and Large Cases Division. The cases were selected from those who had a live registration for any of the following taxes — Income Tax, Corporation Tax, VAT, Employer's PAYE/PRSI and Relevant Contracts Tax.Q. What does the programme test?
The programme tests taxpayer compliance. Compliance measurement is a measure of the extent to which taxpayers fulfil their tax obligations.  There are three basic tax obligations:Taxpayers are obliged to file their returns on time (filing obligation);Taxpayers are obliged to pay the liability on time (payment obligation), andTaxpayers are obliged to report accurately on the return whatever is required for the correct liability to be established (reporting obligation).Q. How do the Revenue Commissioners use the results of the new random audit programmes?
I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are a number of secondary objectives associated with the new random programme and results will be used to evaluate these objectives. These are:1. To validate the risk criteria being used to select cases for audit: This is one of the most frequently mentioned uses for random audit programmes as expressed by jurisdictions that operate a random audit programme.  Typically this implies auditing a random sample of cases and comparing the results with those of cases that have been selected using risk-scoring systems.  The expectation is that the adjustments, which arise on the risk selected cases, should be considerably higher than those from the randomly selected cases.With the advent of Revenue's computerised risk scoring system, REAP, which is use throughout Revenue, this validation exercise will be more important in the future.  The random programme will also have a role to play in the future identification of risk and the development of the risk assessment model.2. Identifying emerging issuesChanges in the nature of economic activity and in tax legislation can give rise to new sources of tax evasion activity.  Random case selection offers Revenue a means of gathering information on new forms of tax evasion activity that may not come to light using the existing risk assessment model.3. Policy ChangesRandom selection may provide data to allow the Revenue Commissioners to identify policy changes for improving tax compliance, including requests for staffing and resources.Q. When will the results be available?
I have already given you the results for 2005 and prior years as well as an update for 2006. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they expect to have a comprehensive analysis of the 2006 programme available by October 2007. However, the finalisation of audits depends on the nature and complexity of the cases selected, as some difficult cases will be expected to have a longer timescale for completion and this may have an impact on the result evaluation target date. I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners expect to have a comprehensive analysis of the 2007 programme available by the Summer of 2008.Q. Why confine the programme to 400 cases?
Internationally a sample in the order of 400 cases is regarded as an adequate sample for the purposes of an exercise such as this. With a sample size of 400 we can be 95% confident that the average results are broadly representative of the taxpayer population sampled. However we will keep this figure under review.While the random audit programme is important therefore, its significance should not be overplayed. The main focus of Revenue will continue to be on selecting cases for audit based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available. This is the type of targeted audit that gets best results and that is most likely to change the behaviour of the taxpayer into the future. The targeted approach is now greatly enhanced by the new computerised Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling System (REAP) developed by Revenue. This system, which categorises taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria, has been successfully piloted and has been introduced nationwide during 2006. The system allows for the screening of all tax returns against sectoral and business norms and provides a selection basis for check or audits. This effectively means that 100% of self-assessed taxpayers will be risk assessed at least once a year. This approach allows valuable audit resources to be assigned to tackling those cases featuring in the higher end of risk ranking and analysis of the 2005 and 2006 random results to date shows that there is strong evidence to suggest that this risk-based approach is the correct one.Q. Are there any big settlements arising from the 2005 and 2006 random audits closed to date?

Part of this success has been due to the ability of these governments to identify and address any issues under their control that might have put that growth at risk. It is my intention that this good work continue into the future.Of course, as a small, open economy, Ireland is heavily reliant on the health of the international economy and external shocks have the potential to significantly reduce Irish growth. In this regard, my Department is constantly monitoring developments in the world economy. While the current view of international agencies (e.g. the EU and the OECD) for the world economic outlook is benign, we must not be complacent.  Our ability to respond to any shock depends on the underlying health of the economy, in particular its competitiveness on international markets. This underlines the need, for example, to take whatever action is feasible to restrain domestic costs to help maintain and restore competitiveness.

Information which will assist in such estimation was however requested on the 2005 Return of Income. The processing of these returns is currently under way and when completed this should facilitate the compilation of statistics for 2005. It is intended to capture similar information from the 2006 returns which are due by the end of October 2007.I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that enquiries relating to residence are a normal part of their risk-based audit programme. The methods and procedures used to verify claims for non-residency are, as with other procedures, reviewed by Revenue on a regular basis.

In particular, I would refer the Deputy to investment in the following key areas:€bnEconomic Infrastructure54.66Enterprise, Science and Innovation20.00Human Capital25.80Within these areas there will be key investment as follows:€bnTransport32.9Energy8.5Environmental Services5.8Science, Technology & Innovation7.6Enterprise Development3.3Training and Skills Development7.7Higher Education13.0The above are all vitally important to maintaining the productive capacity of the economy and will be supported by other investments set out in Plan. The overall objective is a world class infrastructure and R&D system, complemented by the highest quality education and skills services, to ensure a productive and highly skilled workforce. The level of commitment to capital investment is evidenced by the fact that Central Government Investment will rise from around 4.5% of GNP in 2006 to an average of 5.4% of GNP over the period of the Plan.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 103 together.Inheritance tax is part of the capital acquisitions tax (CAT) code, which includes both gift tax and inheritance tax.  It was first introduced in 1976 and replaced estate duty taxation.  The Finance Act 2000 introduced a package of measures specifically designed to reduce the impact of CAT where assets are transferred.  These measures included increased thresholds, the introduction of a single low rate of tax at 20% and the exemption of the family home in the circumstances described below.  These measures constituted the most radical reduction in the incidence of gift/inheritance tax since its introduction in 1976.The CAT code includes group thresholds, below which no CAT is liable.  The relationship between the person who provides the gift/inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person receiving the gift/inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the tax-free threshold applicable to the inheritance (the group threshold).  There are three categories of relationship with regard to relief from CAT and these are increased on an annual basis in accordance with the CSO Consumer Price Index.  The indexed group thresholds applying to a gift or inheritance for 2007 are set out in the table.GroupRelationship to DisponerGroup Threshold 2007€ASon/Daughter496,824BParent/Brother/Sister/Niece/ Nephew/Grandchild49,682CRelations other than Group A or B24,841Any other gifts/inheritance that might have been received within the same group by an individual since 5 December 1991 are also taken into account when applying the thresholds for the purposes of calculating CAT.  If the total value of all inheritances and gifts, within the group, which were received since this date is above the relevant threshold, then a 20% CAT will apply on the difference.In addition to the group thresholds, the Finance Act 2000 introduced a very valuable exemption from CAT for certain dwelling houses.  The purpose of the exemption is to benefit individuals who have been living in a house for a period prior to the taking of the benefit by way of inheritance.  The conditions attaching to this exemption are not very restrictive and the main condition is that the beneficiary has to occupy the dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of three years prior to the gift or inheritance and continue to reside in it for a period of six years after the date of the gift or inheritance.  It is a full exemption without the application of any ceiling or requirement that the beneficiary has to be related to the disponer.I have no plans to introduce any changes at this point.

The Commission will be specifically charged with considering and making recommendations on the following:Examine the balance achieved between taxes collected on income, capital and spending and report on itReview all tax expenditures with a view to recommending the discontinuation of those that are unjustifiable on cost/benefit groundsConsider options for the future financing of local governmentIn the context of maintaining a strong economy, investigate fiscal measures to protect and enhance the environment including the introduction of a carbon taxI will be bringing proposals to Government in the near future on matters relating to the establishment of the proposed Commission including its membership and terms of reference.  Pending consideration by the Government of these proposals, I am not in a position to elaborate further on matters pertaining to the Commission or its work programme.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	518	The Government has, over the last number of years, followed a policy under which growth in public service employment has slowed overall.  The Government will continue to control and regulate numbers employed in the public service within agreed ceilings.  The number employed is kept under constant review given the importance of striking an appropriate balance between the need, on the one hand, to provide resources to improve front-line services and cater for demographic pressures and the need, on the other, to control and regulate overall numbers in the context of providing value for money for the public expenditure involved.This strategy will govern decisions about staffing issues arising from the implementation of the Programme for Government which will be taken in the context of the annual estimates process having regard to the Government's budgetary policy as set out in the Programme.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	519	The commitment in the Programme for Government is "to instigate a review of the entire economic regulatory environment." The purpose of the review is to ensure that "the existing regulatory regime is operating efficiently, is balancing the needs of users with the requirements of producers and is not imposing excessive costs on the economy."  The details of how it is intended to conduct this proposed review are currently being considered and further detailed information will be provided to the Dáil on the implementation arrangements in due course.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The role of the Consumer Director in the Financial Regulator includes monitoring the provision of financial services to consumers.   In that context the Financial Regulator has prioritised the provision of information for consumers about the potential risk of excessive credit card debt. Credit card cost surveys have been undertaken by the Financial Regulator and are available to help consumers in assessing the appropriateness of using a credit card and to help choose the credit card that best suits their financial needs.  The Financial Regulator recommends that in particular, consumers take on the right type of credit for the right purpose and has highlighted that credit cards are not suitable for long-term debt as the rates are considerably higher than for other forms of credit.  The Financial Regulator also issues information to help people who have problems with credit card debt.  This information is available through its publications, help-line and website (www.itsyourmoney.ie).All credit card providers must comply with the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code.  This requires financial service providers to ensure that any financial products provided are suitable for the needs of the consumer.  When a credit institution is changing its interest rates, it must state the effective date of the new rate.  It must also update the interest rate details on its information services as soon as the change comes into effect. Credit card limits cannot be increased unless requested by the consumer.The Deputy may wish to note that credit card debt represents less than 2% of personal sector credit, and less than 1% of overall private sector credit.  In addition, credit card data refers to debt outstanding on all credit cards at end-month and includes balances that may be paid in full at the payment due date.  The increase in the number of credit cards issued and the amount of debt outstanding is in line with a general trend of increased market penetration in the EU and a move towards electronic retail payment methods.The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt.  MABS offices throughout the country work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and  budgeting for the future. The 2007 budget for MABS is €17.7 m.

If the Deputy wishes to estimate costs for future years, he could apply this indicative figure to the pay increases set out in Towards 2016 or to forecasts for wages growth published by the European Commission in its Autumn 2006 Economic Forecast or the Quarterly Economic Commentary published by the ESRI in March 2007.The costs quoted are provisional, subject to revision and estimated to the nearest €5 million.  The ready reckoner is available on my Department's website, at www.finance.gov.ie.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 110 together.I would like to confirm the Government's commitment to the Decentralisation Programme and to re-iterate that this Government's policy on the programme is unchanged.  To date over 10,600 have applied to decentralise through the Central Applications Facility and despite consistent negative commentary, no political spokesperson has said that any town or county should be dropped from the programme.A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) was submitted to me and published on 4th October last.  The Group reported that implementation of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.  It has been meeting with the Secretaries General of decentralising Departments and is satisfied that the implementation of the programme is being managed in a professional and carefully planned manner.  At the end of April 2007, over 2,700 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts.  It is expected that over 1,000 will be in place this summer in over 20 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 33 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred.  The precise numbers moving within that time frame will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment.The property programme is well advanced.  The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis.  Based on its experience to date in relation to timeframes for property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements, it has provided an updated schedule of the likely availability of accommodation.This schedule allows for the planned movement of up to 6,800 staff in the next three years in line with the timeframes set out in the June 2005 report of the DIG.  The delivery time for some locations will be later than originally projected, however, leading to a greater concentration of moves in 2009 rather than in 2008.  Matters outside the control of the OPW, which could give rise to delay, will continue to be monitored and mitigating action taken where possible.Discussions are ongoing with the unions representing professional & technical staff in the Civil Service on the range of industrial relations issues arising, including promotion arrangements and placing of staff who wish to remain in Dublin.  Thirty State Agencies are due to relocate under the Government's Decentralisation Programme.  Some 2,340 posts are involved, or just over 22% of the programme.The Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) did not set specific timeframes for the State Agencies as they believed that it was the responsibility of the board and senior management of each agency to implement the Government decision and to report to its "parent" department in the first instance on the progress being made.  The DIG noted in its latest Report that while progress has been made by some State agencies, there has been a marked lack of action in some other agencies.  The Group is currently meeting with CEOs from a number of State agencies to get an overview of progress to date and to identify the challenges remaining in implementing the Government policy.The main issues facing the State agencies are those relating to the filling of posts in undersubscribed locations, the placing of staff choosing to remain in Dublin and promotion arrangements.  The main issues facing the State Agencies are those relating to the filling of posts in undersubscribed locations, the placing of staff choosing to remain in Dublin and promotion arrangements.  These issues are the subject of ongoing contacts between my Department and ICTU.An approach based on negotiations and agreement has enabled significant progress to be made in relation to the Civil Service moves and it is the intention to continue with this policy in relation to the professional and technical grades in both the Civil Service and the State Agency sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	523	The arrangement mentioned in the question arises where the developer obtains a licence from the landowner that entitles the developer to enter onto the land and erect buildings.  The usual way of achieving this is for the landowner to grant the developer or his bank or both a power of attorney, which allows them to execute a conveyance or transfer of the legal title to the ultimate purchaser without further recourse to the landowner.  Because there is no conveyance of the land from the landowner to the developer stamp duty does not arise at this point.  Stamp duty does, however, arise when the ultimate purchaser buys the land on which a building will usually have been erected by the developer, subject to the availability of the normal stamp duty reliefs.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not, in the normal course, receive information on the number or value of transactions by developers that involved licence agreements or other such arrangements.  Developers are not required to bring such arrangements to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners.  However, I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the course of a recent review, based on a survey of developers, of these arrangements, 60 instances of this type of transaction were identified in responses relating to the two-year period ending on 31 December 2005.The Finance Act 2007, in Section 110, made provision for a charge to stamp duty where license agreements and other such arrangements are used.  License agreements and the other arrangements will come within the terms of the section where the landowner receives a payment amounting to 25% or more of the market value or consideration concerned.Section 110 is subject to a commencement order and I have to consider the state of the property market before the provision comes into effect to ensure that it does not have an unforeseen negative effect on the market.  For this reason I have decided to commission an independent study of the potential effects that such a provision may have on the market.  A "Terms of Reference" for the study is currently being finalised in my Department and a request inviting tenders will issue shortly.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I would stress that the efficient management and implementation of capital projects is a matter for implementing Departments and Agencies.  My Department has set out an elaborate Value for Money framework dealing with such areas as appraisal, implementation, procurement etc to assist Departments and Agencies in delivering projects in a Value for Money way.I recently established a small Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit (CEEU) in my Department to more generally promote the better application of aspects of the Value for Money framework referred to above.  Key responsibilities of the Unit include:—Verification of the application of the 2005 Capital Appraisal Guidelines issued by my Department;Co-ordination of overall implementation of the comprehensive programme of Value for Money and Policy Reviews agreed by Government last year;Preparation and rollout of the Programme Evaluations under the National Development Plan 2007-2013; andGeneral remit to promote Value for Money across the system including through the provision, as resources permit, of technical and other advice to Departments and Agencies.One element of the Unit's work programme does relate to the requirement for spot checks of capital projects for compliance with the capital investment VFM frameworks.  Spot checks are in the first instance the responsibility of each spending Department, who are required to put a system in place to carry out spot checks of projects to ensure compliance with the VFM frameworks and to report their findings annually to my Department.  The CEEU will review these spot check reports and may also directly undertake its own spot checks of individual capital projects either as part of this review process or on its own initiative.The CEEU is currently reviewing the spot check reports submitted in 2007 by line Departments.  It has also commenced its own series of spot checks of individual capital projects and is at present finalising its reports on a number of projects in the transport sector.  The Unit will be rolling out its programme of spot checks over the remainder of 2007 primarily focussed on the bigger capital spending Departments.  In this connection, the Unit is currently finalising  arrangements for spot checks of projects in two other significant capital spending Departments and it expects to commence spot checks in these sectors shortly.Reports on CEEU spot checks will be conveyed to the relevant Departments.  These reports may include advice on the planning, appraisal and execution of specific projects by reference to the VFM framework in place.  It will be a matter in the first instance for the relevant Department/ Agency to respond to and action this advice.  The CEEU will, however, pay particular attention to follow up on advice it has given in subsequent engagement with relevant Departments and Agencies.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	525	Exchequer tax receipts to end-May were, at €18,603 million, just €19 million or 0.1 per cent below profile.  They were up 9.6 per cent on the same period last year.  This compares with a Budget day target of an increase of 7.8 per cent for 2007 as a whole.  While overall tax receipts are almost exactly on target at end-May there are some variations under particular tax heads.Corporation tax receipts are €221 million or 17.5 per cent above profile.Customs receipts are €4 million or 3.6 per cent above profile.VAT receipts were €28 million or 0.4 per cent below profile.Income Tax receipts are €56 million or 1.1 per cent below profile.Excise duties were €120 million or 4.7 per cent below profile.Stamp duties were €16 million or 1.1 per cent below profile.Capital Taxes were €71 million or 5.8 per cent below profile.  Of these, Capital Gains Tax was €79 million or 7.2 per cent below; and Capital Acquisition Tax was €8 million or 5.1 per cent above.Given the significance of tax payments in the latter part of the year, it is unwise to attempt to draw conclusions about the performance of the economy based on tax receipts at this early stage.  The latest available economic estimates show that the economy continues to perform well.  Preliminary CSO data for 2006 as a whole indicates that GDP growth was 6.0 per cent while in GNP terms, the growth rate in 2006 was estimated at 7.4 per cent.In the circumstances I do not see a need to revise our forecast at this stage.  However, my Department monitors tax receipts on an ongoing basis and as more data becomes available any significant changes to the expected end year receipts will be signalled once it becomes clear.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	526	In the period up to the end of May this year, the Exchequer received €1,438 million in stamp duties, which is just €16 million or 1.1 per cent below profile.  The end-May figure represents an increase of 11 per cent on the same period last year.  The target for the year as a whole is for an increase of 5.6 per cent.While there may be some variation in the individual tax heads, on the basis of the performance to end-May, there is no need, at this stage, to revise our overall tax forecast.  However my Department monitors tax receipts on an ongoing basis.  We will take account of the costs arising from policy changes in Stamp Duty for first time buyers and any other significant changes in the expected end of year outlook.  All changes in the forecast, as in the past, will be signalled when these changes become clear.My Department will also be keeping the performance of the overall economy, including the housing market, under continuing review and any changes that appear will be taken into account in our ongoing assessment of the likely outturn for stamp duty receipts at year-end.

The NPRF joined a group of the world's largest institutional investment funds in signing the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment when they were launched in April 2006.  The aim of the Principles is to integrate consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices and, thereby, to improve long-term returns for investors.As set out in the Annual Report of the NPRF Commission for 2006, the Commission is taking specific measures to implement the Principles.  Its initial focus is on the development and implementation of a comprehensive proxy voting policy and development of the capacity to engage on ESG issues with the companies in which Fund moneys are invested.  It has decided to contract third-party service providers to deliver these services within NPRF policy guidelines and expects that these proxy voting and engagement services will be in place shortly.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Labour Court Recommendation 18912 related to the engagement of agency workers by the Health Service Executive West region.  The Court found that the lack of prior consultation by management with the union (IMPACT) in relation to the engagement of agency workers was in breach of the provisions of Sustaining Progress and Towards 2016.  The Court further recommended that the HSE-West should restore staffing levels to their previous levels without the use of agency workers.This Labour Court recommendation related to particular circumstances in the Health Service Executive West region.  It is a matter for individual public service employing bodies to consider whether it has any implications for them but I do not see it as having any implications for the public service generally.To refer to the "public sector embargo on recruitment" does not properly reflect Government policy on public service numbers.  There has not been any embargo on recruitment.  The Government has, over the last number of years, followed a policy under which growth in public service employment has slowed overall.  The Government will continue to control and regulate numbers employed in the public service within agreed ceilings.  The number employed is kept under constant review given the importance of striking an appropriate balance between the need, on the one hand, to provide resources to improve front-line services and cater for demographic pressures and the need, on the other, to control and regulate overall numbers in the context of providing value for money for the public expenditure involved.This strategy will govern decisions about employment in public services.  It is a matter for each Minister and Department to manage their employment levels within this strategy.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	530	On 8 February 2007 I launched the Social Finance Foundation to implement the Social Finance Initiative announced in Budget 2006.  The Foundation has been established on a not-for-profit basis to act as a wholesale supplier of social finance for on-lending by specialist social finance lenders to support social and developmental projects and social enterprise in local communities.The Foundation is a private company established under Company Law and is governed by its Board of Directors under its Memorandum and Articles of Association.  The company has received seed funding of €25 million from the Irish banking sector for distribution to qualifying Social Lending Organisations.The Foundation's lending policies and procedures as well as the appointment, role and responsibilities of staff and their terms and conditions of employment are matters for the Board of the Foundation.  The Board is chaired by Mr Peter Quinn and information on the other directors of the Foundation is included in the press release issued by my Department which is available on the Department's website at www.finance.gov.ie.  My Department has been advised by the Foundation that the Board is currently in the process of reviewing applications received from Social Lending Organisations and the first loans are expected to issue shortly.I see the launch of the Foundation as a catalyst for deeper participation by private finance in the area of local and community development and social enterprise.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	531	As the Deputy may be aware, the monthly Exchequer Returns are available on my Department's website, as are my Department's tax receipts, expenditure and debt service profiles for 2007.  The Exchequer Balance to end-May 2007 showed a surplus of €266 million compared to a surplus of €1,841 million for the same period last year.  The Budget day forecast is for a deficit of €546 million for 2007 as a whole.  Exchequer tax receipts to end-May were, at €18,603 million, just €19 million or 0.1 per cent below profile.  They were up 9.6 per cent on the same period last year.  This compares with a Budget day target of an increase of 7.8 per cent for 2007 as a whole.Corporation tax receipts were €221 million above profile.  The other main tax-heads were all below profile.  Stamp duties were €16 million below target, VAT was €28 million below, income tax was €56 million below, capital taxes were €71 million below and excise duties were €120 million below target.  This resulted in overall tax receipts at end-May being almost exactly in line with profile.Overall issues for net voted expenditure in the period to end-May 2007 were €88 million or 0.5 per cent above profile.  Net voted capital expenditure at end-May was €160 million higher than expected due to stronger than expected progress on a number of projects while net voted current expenditure was €72 million below profile.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	532	The Programme for Government signals that a carbon tax/levy will be introduced over the lifetime of this Government.  The matter of the introduction of a carbon tax is one of the issues to be considered by the new Commission on Taxation to be established under the Programme.  Consequently, at this stage, the precise design of such a tax has yet to be determined.  This will, of course, form an important part of the normal deliberative process of the Government in setting fiscal and environmental policy.  Deputies will recall, however, that the Programme for Government indicates that the phasing-in of a carbon levy will be on a revenue neutral basis, so it is not intended that its introduction will lead to any net Exchequer revenue increase or net addition to the overall tax burden.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide information on the volume of complaints in relation to tax-free allowances and tax credits.  If a taxpayer requests an amendment to a Tax Credit Certificate this is not recorded as a complaint.  Revenue have further advised that by the 9th February last, they had completed the bulk issue of 2,194,174 Tax Credit Certificates (TCCs) to PAYE taxpayers, reflecting the changes announced in the 2007 Budget.  Revenue identified a small number of certificates that contained errors and these were rectified automatically.A further 859,156 TCCs issued in the period to 21 June, 2007.  These relate to cases where individual taxpayers have advised Revenue of changed circumstances, have requested reviews, have claimed additional credits and allowances or sought duplicate certificates.  In general where a PAYE taxpayer requests changes to their tax credits or allowances an amended TCC will issue within 20 working days of the request being received.In relation to the on-line self-service facility now available to PAYE taxpayers, Revenue have informed me that 67,823 transactions were carried out using this facility from 1 January to 3 June this year.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	534	In Budget 2006 I announced the introduction of a limit, with effect from 1 January 2007, on the use of tax reliefs, including certain exemptions, by some high-income individuals.  Section 17 of Finance Act 2006 gave effect to this announcement.  This measure was designed to address the issue of a small number of individuals with high incomes who, up to now, have been able to reduce their income tax liability to a very low level or to zero, mainly by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs.  Such individuals are no longer able to do so.  This provision will ensure that such individuals who use listed tax incentive schemes will have an effective rate of income tax for each year of not less than about 20 per cent on the income sheltered by such schemes.The method used to increase the tax rates at which these high income individuals pay tax, effectively addresses the equity concerns raised over the past number of years while at the same time, ensuring that the intended incentive effects of tax schemes will continue to be delivered.Broadly, the reliefs restricted are those reliefs that have primarily been used by high income individuals to significantly reduce their tax liability.  These are-the various sectoral and area based property tax incentives,certain exemptions including artistic income and patent royalties,the reliefs for donations, andcertain investment incentive reliefs such as the Business Expansion Scheme, film relief and interest relief for investment in companies and partnerships.The normal tax reliefs claimed by taxpayers such as medical expenses, trade union subscriptions, the personal tax credits and exemptions such as that for child benefit are not restricted.  In addition, normal business expenses and deductions for capital allowances on plant and machinery, genuine business related trading losses and genuine losses from a rental business have not been restricted.I do not intend to introduce any further restrictions on the use of specified tax reliefs at this time.  I would point out, however, that Finance Act 2007 introduced technical amendments to the restriction which will help to ensure that the measure will work as intended. Included in these amendments are provisions to enable the Revenue Commissioners to seek whatever information may be necessary from individuals affected by the restriction, so as to ensure that Revenue are in a position to monitor and assess the impact of the restriction in terms of numbers affected, the additional tax paid and the nature of the reliefs restricted.

It may be helpful, however, to set out a list of current legislative priorities for my Department:—Bills PublishedFinance (No. 2) Bill 2007This Bill provides for the amendment of Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  This Bill has been published and is to be considered by the Dáil before the summer recess.Ministers and Secretaries (Ministers of State) Bill 2007This Bill provides for the increase in the number of Ministers of State who may be appointed by the Government under Section 1(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1977.  This Bill has been published and is to be considered by the Dáil before the summer recess.Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007While the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive has been transposed by Statutory Instrument (S.I. 60 of 2007), some complementary adjustments require primary legislation through this Bill.  The Bill is also being availed of to make necessary technical amendments to various Acts.  This Bill is to be restored to the Dáil Order Paper by way of a Government Chief Whip's Motion.Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Ethics in Public Office Acts so as to require office holders and Oireachtas members to seek the opinion of the Standards in Public Office Commission before accepting significant benefits from a friend for personal reasons. The Bill is currently on the Seanad Order Paper.Bills yet to be PublishedOmbudsman (Amendment) BillThe purpose of the Bill is to widen the remit of the Ombudsman to include a range of additional bodies and to make provision regarding administrative procedures. Publication is expected in the latter half of 2007.Financial Services Regulation BillThe purpose of this Bill is to consolidate and simplify financial services legislation in accordance with the Government's Better Regulation agenda.  An advisory Forum is being established to assist and advise the Department in the completion of this project.  It is currently envisaged that Heads of Bill will be delivered one year after the establishment of the Forum, currently scheduled for the third quarter of 2007.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	536	Stamp duty is a tax on certain documents, generally legal documents, used in transferring property or in creating rights for the parties concerned.  The stamp duty code generally does not provide exemptions based on an individual's particular circumstances and introducing such a provision would represent a significant departure from normal stamp duty rules.  However, I have been advised by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government that a scheme of disabled persons grants is operated by local authorities with capital provision from that Department.These grants are designed to meet the needs of persons who are either physically handicapped or are suffering from severe mental handicap or severe mental illness.  Where a new dwelling is being bought or built a maximum grant of €12,700 is payable.  In the case of adaptation of an existing dwelling, 90% of the approved cost of the works is available up to an effective maximum grant of €20,320.  Full details of the scheme and the conditions applicable are available from the local authority in whose area the dwelling is situated.The Finance (No. 2) Bill 2007 provides that stamp duty will be abolished on any house purchased by a first-time buyer.  A disabled person, who is a first-time buyer, may avail of this exemption.  The Deputy will appreciate that stamp duty is a significant contributor to the Exchequer and stamp duty receipts allow for a broader tax base than would otherwise be possible.  These receipts form an important element of State revenues which permits Government spending on services such as health and education.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax debt outstanding at 31 March 2007 and as reported in its annual report was €1,107million.  This represents 1.8% of gross receipts, a level which is exceptionally low by international standards. The amount under appeal was €315million leaving the remainder, €792million, available for collection.The debt of €792m represents a snapshot of the debt at a particular point in time [31 March 2007] and is a constantly changing figure as additional debt arises and activity by Revenue results in debt being collected. This changing element of the debt composition makes it difficult to accurately predict the likely reduction in the debt figure. However, Revenue estimate that the collectible debt of €792m, plus any additional debts that subsequently arise for the same period, will be reduced by up to 97% over a five year period. The remaining debt will be under control, under appeal or at enforcement. Revenue is not in a position to estimate the likely collection from debt currently under appeal.The strategies and methodologies adopted by Revenue to achieve a reduction over a five-year period are subject to annual review and evaluation that is carried out within the context of the business planning process.  In the context of the preparation of a new Statement of Strategy for 2008-2010, Revenue will be considering the appropriate strategies and targets in relation to debt management for the period ahead.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	538	As the Deputy will be aware, less than 1,000 of the 7,200 Civil Service posts covered by the Decentralisation Programme or 10% of the overall programme is composed of professional and technical posts. While the take up from the professional and technical staff has been low to date, in the region of 140 professional and technical personnel have already been assigned to posts that are decentralising.The Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG), which was established in 2003 to drive the decentralisation process forward, has acknowledged that challenging issues remain in relation to the decentralisation of professional and technical grades including the filling of posts in undersubscribed locations, the placing of staff remaining in Dublin and promotions. While these issues also arise in relation to general service grades, addressing them in the context of professional and technical grades is complicated by the challenges associated with transferring between different organisations or streams.Having met with the Secretaries General of each Civil Service department decentralising in full, the DIG is generally satisfied that a prudent approach is being taken by each organisation in relation to assessing the risks involved and the adoption of appropriate measures to manage business risk.The DIG has asked my Department to explore all appropriate avenues, in consultation with the relevant union representatives, to overcome the difficulties and to come to a conclusion on the issues as soon as possible. In that regard, discussions have been ongoing with the unions representing professional and technical staff and proposals have been tabled in relation to options for staff remaining in Dublin. In addition, staff have been assured of the voluntary nature of the programme.  Those wishing to remain in Dublin will be absorbed into posts in the civil service or, alternatively, in other public service bodies.I am pleased to report that there has been some positive engagement with the relevant unions in a number of individual organisations.As the Deputy will also be aware, there are, in addition to the professional and technical grades in the Civil Service, specialists posts within the State Agencies which are due to decentralise under the Decentralisation Programme. The DIG noted in its latest Report that while progress has been made by some State Agencies, there has been a marked lack of action in some others. The DIG has met with CEOs from a number of State Agencies to get an overview of progress to date and to identify the challenges remaining in implementing the Government policy.The main issues facing the State Agencies are those relating to the filling of posts in undersubscribed locations, the placing of staff choosing to remain in Dublin and promotion arrangements. These issues are the subject of ongoing contacts between my Department and ICTU.An approach based on negotiations and agreement has enabled significant progress to be made in relation to the Civil Service moves and it is the intention to continue with this policy in relation to the professional and technical grades in both the Civil Service and the State Agency sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	539	The Government have already made clear that renewable energy will be a critical and growing component of Irish energy supply to 2020 and beyond.  Renewable energy is an integral part of our climate change strategy and sustainability objectives. The additional diversity which renewables bring to Ireland's energy demand will also make a direct contribution to our goal of ensuring secure and reliable energy supplies.While the promotion of renewable energy is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, as I have stated previously the taxation system, in conjunction with other policy measures, can play a part in attaining environmental objectives including the development and deployment of renewable sources of energy. In this regard the taxation measures which are already in place or are being introduced include:a five year excise relief scheme for biofuels, costing over €200 million, which commenced in November 2006. The scheme provides for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;50 per cent VRT relief for hybrid vehicles, flexible fuel vehicles and electric vehicles;extending the qualifying period from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011 for the scheme of corporate tax relief for corporate equity investments in certain renewable energy generation projects i.e. in solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories, and which have been approved by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources;extending to 31 December 2013 and enhancing the Business Expansion Scheme and the Seed Capital Scheme which can, among manufacturing other areas, be used for investment in companies engaged in renewable energy generation and recycling;amending the VRT and motor tax systems to take greater account of environmental issues, in particular CO2 emissions.Furthermore, the Programme for Government signals that a carbon tax/levy will be introduced over the lifetime of this Government.  The matter of the introduction of a carbon tax is one of the issues to be considered by the new Commission on Taxation to be established under the Programme. Consequently, at this stage, the precise design of such a tax has yet to be determined. This will, of course, form an important part of the normal deliberative process of the Government in setting fiscal and environmental policy. Deputies will recall, however, that the Programme for Government indicates that the phasing-in of a carbon levy will be on a revenue neutral basis, so it is not intended that its introduction will lead to any net Exchequer revenue increase or net addition to the overall tax burden.

The programme of works is now nearing completion.  The handover of the building to the OPW will take place following certification of these works to the satisfaction of the OPW.  A joint (OPW and developer) inspection of the works is scheduled for the week beginning Monday 25th June 2007 and a handover date will be decided following this inspection.After the formal handover of the building to OPW, Revenue will be in a position to complete their networking and telephony installations and the building will be furnished ready for occupation.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I am aware of the report of the Consultative Consumer Panel referred to by the Deputy and the recommendation that more analysis of overcharging by financial institutions should be provided by the Financial Regulator.My Department has been advised by the Financial Regulator that it has implemented a set of General Principles to deal with issues of charging, which were published in the Financial Regulator's 2004 Annual Report. Where the Financial Regulator considers that it is in the public interest, for example, where there are significant difficulties in the repayment process or where the amounts concerned are large, the Financial Regulator may decide that it is appropriate to put a notice in the national media. The Financial Regulator does not see it as necessary or appropriate to publicise every overcharging issue, bearing in mind that the firm will have informed the affected customers, reimbursed and compensated customers and made the appropriate changes to the control environment. The Financial Regulator advised the Consumer Panel of this approach in responding to the Panel's recommendations.My Department has also been informed by the Financial Regulator that an update on charging issues will be provided in its 2006 Annual Report, which will be published next month. The Financial Regulator will continue to monitor reimbursement programmes as part of the ongoing supervisory function with affected firms and ensure that reimbursement programmes are completed in as timely a manner as possible through monitoring and enforcement of the Consumer Protection Code.Ensuring strong and effective public accountability is a key element of the legislation establishing the Financial Regulator. In addition to the annual reports of the Consultative Panels, the major accountability mechanisms include:the Annual Report of the Financial Regulator is laid before each House of the Oireachtasthe Minister for Finance can determine the form of the Financial Regulator's Strategic Plan which is also laid before each House of the Oireachtasthere is a requirement for the Chair, Chief Executive Officer and Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator to appear before the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas that is responsible for examining matters relating to the Financial Regulator and to provide the Committee with whatever information it requiresthe Annual Accounts of the Financial Regulator are audited by the C&AG; a Value For Money Examination of the Financial Regulator has recently been finalised by the C&AG and will be published shortly.Public accountability of the Financial Regulator is also achieved through the extensive consultation undertaken on significant regulatory issues with all the main stakeholders. A February 2007 IMF study of 32 countries that overhauled their regulatory institutions over recent years concluded that the Irish system and structure of financial regulation was first in terms of accountability arrangements as compared with other international single financial regulators.As recommended in the Final Report of the High Level Interdepartmental Committee on the recommendations contained in the Consumer Strategy Group Report my Department will commence a review of the consumer protection role of the Financial Regulator next year. In view of the extensive accountability arrangements which I have outlined, I have no plans for any further review of the Financial Regulator's operations.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, subject to conditions, grants exemption from Capital Acquisitions Tax in respect of a house comprised in a gift or inheritance. The conditions require that the donee or successor must occupy the house for the period of 3 years ending with the date of the gift or inheritance. Where that house has replaced other property, the beneficiary must have resided either in that house or in the other property for periods which, taken together, amounted to 3 years in the 4-year period prior to the date of the gift or inheritance. In addition, the donee or successor, if under the age of 55, must continue to occupy the house as his or her only or main residence for a further period of 6 years. However, there is provision to allow for a replacement house in that period and for situations where the individual concerned is not in occupation of the house because of work obligations abroad.Claims for relief under section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 in respect of high-value houses are verified.Amendments to section 86 were made in the Finance Act 2007. These amendments were a result of Revenue's experience in administering claims under this section, including taking issues before the Appeal Commissioners.Firstly, relief is not available where a donee lives in the principal private residence of the donor, where that residence is gifted, unless the donor is compelled by reason of old age or infirmity to depend on the services of the donee. This is to counter, in particular, the argument that, where the donee, having until then lived in the parental home, is gifted a house by a parent, the 3 year period of occupancy of the gifted house is satisfied.The second change requires that the gifted house be owned by the donor during the 3-year period even if they were not his or her principal private residence. This is to counter a claim for relief where an individual sells his principal private residence to his parent for full value and the house is then gifted back to that individual by his parent. It also counters the use of family trusts in gifting houses to children.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase in Budget 2008 the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers and those who bought a house in the past seven years, from €8,000 to €10,000 for single people and from €16,000 to €20,000 for couples or widowed persons.  The estimated cost of this measure is about €10 million in a full year in 2007 terms.The Programme also contains the commitment that, as income taxes are reduced, the rate of mortgage interest relief will be kept at 20% for all home owners.  The cost of this will form part of the overall cost of the commitment to reduce the standard rate of tax which is to be achieved over the lifetime of the Government if economic resources allow.I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the tax measures in the Government Programme will be implemented subject to the controlling economic and fiscal framework and that the Government are committed to operating a responsible fiscal policy characterised by broad budget balance and a declining debt burden.In addition, the Deputy will be aware that last week I published the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2007 which provides for a stamp duty exemption for a first-time purchaser of a house or apartment which he or she occupies as his or her only or principal place of residence. The Government intend to have the Bill enacted before the Dáil rises for the Summer recess.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	544	While the promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in the Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland.  This scheme, which received the necessary EU State Aid approval, commenced in November 2006 and will:provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annumcost over €200m over 5 years;when fully operational, result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2009;help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, andstimulate activity in the agricultural sector.As a complementary measure, I provided in Finance Act 2006 for a 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles (cars designed to operate on biofuels) for an initial period of two years.The overall level of excise relief available for biofuels under the above mentioned Scheme is that which had been proposed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in advance of Budget 2006.  It is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland's output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the coming years. These fiscal incentives were designed to kickstart the domestic biofuels industry and the evidence suggests that this is happening.The Deputy might wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote biofuels and reach the targets referred to. To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government recently announced its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, with targets for market penetration for biofuels of 5.75% in 2009 and 10% by 2020. The scheme is included in the Programme for Government in conjunction with a commitment to work with our EU partners to require biofuels used in transport to comply with an environmental certification system which incorporates sustainability criteria in terms of biofuel production.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	545	Investment in construction has been driven by strong activity in the residential, commercial and infrastructural sectors. The residential sector has been particularly strong, with the high demand for housing being underpinned by strong economic fundamentals and a rapidly growing population. A gradual easing back of housing output is envisaged in the coming years, with output levelling off at more sustainable long-term levels. However, commitment to the NDP at 5.4% of GNP, will inter alia, ensure that spare capacity from one sector is available in the other commercial and infrastructural sectors.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The Programme for Government sets out clearly the Government's guiding economic and fiscal principles for the next five years. We are fully committed to a responsible fiscal policy, including keeping the budget in broad balance.Within these broad principles, our first priority in the tax area will be to continue to support low and middle income earners, via the tax credits, bands and the PRSI system. The Programme for Government clearly states that once these commitments have been met, any additional resources will be targeted at further enhancing the rewards for work. We are committed to reducing the standard and higher rates of income tax over the lifetime of the Government if economic resources allow.I would point out that the main consumption taxes are VAT and excise duty. Taken together these taxes account for some 43 per cent of total forecast tax revenues in 2007, whereas they accounted for 44 per cent and 46 per cent of total taxes in 1997 and 1987 respectively.While revenues from property related taxes such as stamp duty and capital gains tax have made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, we are not overly reliant on these receipts. Care has been taken not to plan the public finances around an assumption that receipts from stamp duty and capital gains tax will continue to grow in future years as they have done in recent years.I reject the Deputy's suggestion that the policies and commitments in the Programme for Government are imprudent. They are based on a sustainable and responsible fiscal policy.

The Programme for Government re-affirms this commitment.A public consultation in this regard has taken place. Work on the matter is ongoing and a range of possible options are being considered at this stage. It is intended that the changes made to the VRT system will be broadly revenue neutral.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	549	Sub-prime lenders are regulated in Ireland in respect of their lending activities under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The Act makes detailed provision for the form and content of  loan agreements and for advertising of consumer credit.  The Financial Regulator has powers of investigation, review and enforcement in relation to matters covered by the Act.  Consumer complaints about the performance of creditors with respect to their obligations under the Act also fall within the remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Consumer Protection Act 2007 established the National Consumer Agency with an extensive remit including enforcement powers in relation to unfair commercial practices and unfair terms in consumer contracts. In the case of regulated financial service providers these powers may be exercised by the Financial Regulator.I am aware that some lending activities (including those of some non-deposit taking lenders) fall outside the scope of the Financial Regulator's statutory Consumer Protection Code (CPC) and therefore borrowers do not benefit from the additional safeguards which the Code provides. The Third Money Laundering Directive, which is due to be transposed into Irish law by 15 December 2007, requires that financial institutions, as defined in the Directive, be subject to enhanced supervision.  All non-deposit taking lenders and mortgage providers fall under the terms of this Directive and the application of the CPC where it does not currently apply  is being considered in this context.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Over ten thousand six hundred civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Programme. Of these, approximately 5,600 or 53% are currently based in Dublin. The Central Applications Facility (CAF) remains open and continues to receive applications. My Department has requested an update of the CAF data from the Public Appointments Service and will make this available when received.Discussions have concluded on a number of human resource and industrial relations matters and are being progressed on other issues.  At the end of April 2007, over 2,700 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts. It is expected that over 1,000 will be in place this summer in over 20 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 33 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred. The precise numbers moving within that time frame will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment.Across the public service, recruitment and promotion practices generally are being managed in a way which facilitates the achievement of the Decentralisation Programme in an efficient manner.  Agreement has been reached with the Civil Service unions representing general service staff that all interdepartmental promotions will be made on the basis of the appointee agreeing to move to a post in a decentralising unit, Department or Office. Where an organisation is moving in full, all internal promotions will include a decentralisation condition in the 52 week period prior to the move.  Where an organisation is moving in part, 50% of all internal promotions will include a decentralisation condition in the 52 week period prior to the move taking place.  These arrangements allow for a proportion of all promotions arising in Civil Service general service posts in the normal course to have a decentralisation condition.The primary mechanism for placing civil servants who are in posts which are due to decentralise but wish to remain in Dublin is by way of bilateral transfer.  As staff whose organisations are remaining in Dublin, but who themselves have applied to relocate, continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin.In addition, the Public Appointments Service operates a system which will match Dublin based posts with people wishing to remain in Dublin.  Any decentralising organisation which anticipates that it will have staff wishing to remain in Dublin who cannot be placed within the organisation will engage with the Public Appointments Service in the placement of these individuals.Following detailed discussions with the civil service unions, the precise operation of these arrangements was amended earlier this year to improve their overall effectiveness. The aim is to achieve a close alignment between the assignment of staff to Dublin posts and the readiness of Departments to release staff at particular grade levels. In that context, Departments and Offices provide updates to the Public Appointments Service in relation to posts that require to be filled and staff that require to be placed through these arrangements.  This will be an ongoing process throughout the transition phase of the Programme.Discussions are ongoing with the unions representing professional & technical staff in the Civil Service on the range of industrial relations issues arising, including promotion arrangements and placing of staff who wish to remain in Dublin.The position in relation to the State Agencies is of course more complex.  The Government has always said that this is a voluntary Programme.  Any staff member wishing to remain in Dublin will be accommodated with a public service job in Dublin.  However, there is a need to balance the business needs of the organisation in furthering its relocation objective with the needs of staff remaining in Dublin.  In these circumstances promotions policy must take account of the reality of Decentralisation.  It is my strong view that these issues can be resolved through dialogue and negotiations.

Cork.  I am advised by PAS and the Valuation Office that the number of people who have indicated their desire to decentralise to Youghal with these offices is 100 and 28 respectively.  In accordance with the indicative timescale set out in the report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group both offices are working towards decentralising to Youghal in mid 2009.I am informed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) that they have agreed terms to acquire a local authority site in Youghal from Cork County Council.  The legal formalities are being pursued by the Chief State Solicitors Office in consultation with Cork County Council's legal representatives.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	553	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the scope for reducing the VAT rate on environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent to the reduced rate of 13.5 per cent. I should mention that this is just one of a number of initiatives in the Programme aimed at delivering a cleaner environment.In carrying out this examination account will be taken of the growing range of  environmental and renewable energy products which present opportunities to reduce our dependence on conventional energy systems and can make a contribution to tackling Climate Change. For example, energy-efficient insulation materials, renewable energy systems including wind, solar and geothermal systems, and the options arising in the bio-energy crop sector will be examined.In considering a change in VAT arrangements for these, or indeed any other, goods and services, it is important to bear in mind that the treatment of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.It is important however to point out that the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5 per cent may currently be applied to insulation materials and renewable energy systems where these products are supplied and installed as a single contract and where the VAT-exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT-exclusive charge to the customer.  I understand that the bulk of supply and install contracts are likely to meet this so-called "two-thirds" rule, resulting in the reduced VAT rate of 13.5 per cent rate being applied. Consequently, under existing VAT arrangements, the reduced VAT rate can apply to environmental products where they form part of such a supply and installation arrangement.The reduced VAT rate of 13.5 per cent also currently applies to the supply of all fuel products, including wood pellets, used for home heating and light. Ireland is one of only eight Member States that apply a reduced VAT rate to the supply of fuel products used for home heating and light.The purpose of our proposed VAT review is to examine whether there is scope within EU VAT law to further extend the application of the reduced VAT rate in the area of environmental goods and services. This and other measures under the Programme for Government clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to addressing the environmental challenges which we face.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	555	I accept that the tax system can be used either to encourage or deter certain behaviours that have impacts on the environments. In this regard I have been to the fore in using the tax system to promote environmental policies; examples includeexcise relief of over €200 million for biofuels over 5 years from 200650% VRT relief for flexible fuel vehicles, hybrid cars and electric carsthe inclusion of recycling companies in BES/Seed Capital Schemes from 2007, andextending the tax relief for corporate investment in renewable energy.In addition, work is continuing with respect to the commitment in last year's Budget, to introduce changes to the current VRT and Motor Tax systems to take greater account of environmental issues, and in particular CO2 emissions, from a target date of 1 January 2008.Furthermore, the Programme for Government signals that a carbon tax/levy will be introduced over the lifetime of this Government.  The matter of the introduction of a carbon tax is one of the issues to be considered by the new Commission on Taxation to be established under the Programme. Consequently, at this stage, the precise design of such a tax has yet to be determined. This will, of course, form an important part of the normal deliberative process of the Government in setting fiscal and environmental policy. Deputies will recall, however, that the Programme for Government indicates that the phasing-in of a carbon levy will be on a revenue neutral basis, so it is not intended that its introduction will lead to any net Exchequer revenue increase or net addition to the overall tax burden.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I was pleased to note the strong performance on a number of fronts recorded in the eighty-fourth Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners. The 2006 Report continues the practice of reporting on Revenue's Statement of Strategy, in accordance with the Public Service Management Act 1997.  This is the second report on Revenue's Statement of Strategy 2005-2007 which highlights three main Goals:To ensure everyone complies with their tax and Customs responsibilities;To be a capable, flexible, results-oriented organisation, and,To play its part nationally and internationally.The three Goals and their associated strategies are reported on in detail in the annual Report, some of the highlights of which are as follows:2006 was another year of very strong tax collection performance. Net receipts amounted to €45.5 billion, some €6 billion above the corresponding figure for 2005 and €3.7 billion above the Budget estimate.Special investigations yielded a total of €119.6 million in 2006 of which €88.3 million arose from the Single Premium Insurance Policy and Offshore Assets investigations. The cumulative total from special investigations currently stands at €2.3 billion.Seven convictions for serious tax and duty evasion were secured in 2006. A further 515 convictions were obtained for summary offences and there were 1,295 convictions for non-filing of tax returns.Revenue continued the sectoral approach to audit. New projects initiated included the construction sector, publicans, computer consultants, coffee shops, restaurants and take-aways, hotels and rental income. The construction sector project alone yielded €125 million in tax, interest and penalties. Some 1,600 site visits identified over 1,000 cases not registered with Revenue and almost 500 sub-contractors who were reclassified as employees.  This project is continuing in 2007.Total audit and assurance check activity yielded €691.8 million and the names of 601 tax defaulters who concluded audit settlements amounting to €154 million were published.A range of on-line and telephony self-service options were provided for PAYE taxpayers.  It is now open to any of the 2.2 million PAYE customers to view their tax records, claim a wide range of tax credits, apply for repayments, request a tax review and change personal details — all on-line.The Revenue On-Line Service (ROS) continued its strong growth in 2006. The number of payment transactions made via ROS increased by 40.48% to 408,575 while the value of the payments made via ROS increased by 37.19% to €16.6 billion.To help ease the regulatory burden on business, less frequent filing of PAYE/PRSI returns was introduced in 2006 for employers whose annual PAYE/PRSI liability was €30,000 or less.  A similar initiative has recently been extended to VAT.Arrears as a percentage of total gross receipts now stand at an historic low of 1.8% — one of the lowest of any tax administration worldwide. Overall debt was €1,107 million in 2006.Drugs with an estimated street value of €8.6 million were seized; tobacco with a value of almost €18.5 million and almost €725,000 of suspected criminal cash was detained by Revenue's Customs Service.I announced in my Budget statement in December that Revenue would undertake a series of simplification measures to make the process of claiming reliefs as easy as possible in as many areas as possible. The first of these measures, the operation of DIRT — free accounts for people aged over 65 and the permanently incapacitated (subject to income limits in both cases) is now up and running and others are due to follow in 2007 and 2008.While the volume of Revenue's business increased significantly during 2006, the cost of administration as a percentage of Gross Receipts fell to 0.77%, down from 0.81% in the previous year. This figure, which is now at a record low and which compares very favourably with other Tax and Customs Administrations worldwide, is a useful measure of administrative efficiency and clearly demonstrates Revenue's commitment to delivering value for money and maximising benefits from new technology .I am satisfied that Revenue's Annual Report for 2006 reflects considerable success in all of its business areas, as borne out by the strong receipts and successful compliance activity, and displays Revenue's commitment to develop and enhance service provision across all of its activities.

The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.

Under the revised system the benefit to an employee of a car provided by his or her employer is calculated by reference to the original market price of the car and the employee's annual business mileage. For example, where an employee's annual business mileage is 15,000 miles or less the benefit of the car is calculated at 30% of the original market price of the car. This falls to 6% where the employee's business mileage is 30,001 business miles and over. The tapering of rates ensures that employees who genuinely need to travel significantly in the course of their work incur a lower benefit-in-kind charge.Work is continuing with respect to the commitment in Budget 2007 to introduce changes to the current VRT system, to take greater account of environmental issues, and in particular CO2 emissions, from a target date of 1 January 2008. A public consultation in this regard has taken place and a range of possible options are being considered at this stage. Following the outcome of this exercise, it may well be appropriate to examine the scope for linking the structure of the benefit-in-kind system to emissions. Any changes would be a matter for consideration in the context of future budgetary policy.

I am informed by PAS and the Valuation Office that the number of people who have indicated their desire to decentralise to Youghal with these offices is 100 and 28 respectively.  In accordance with the indicative timescale set out in the report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group both offices are working towards decentralising to Youghal in mid 2009.  I am advised by the OPW that they have agreed terms to acquire a local authority site in Youghal from Cork County Council.  The legal formalities are being pursued by the Chief State Solicitors Office in consultation with Cork County Council's legal representatives.I am also advised by the OPW that the number of people who have indicated their desire to decentralise to Kanturk is 90.  In accordance with the indicative timescale set out in the report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group the OPW is working towards decentralising to Kanturk by the end of 2008.  The acquisition of a suitable site in Kanturk is well advanced.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that details from inheritance tax returns are not captured in such a way as to provide a basis for compiling the information sought by the Deputy. It is, therefore, not possible to separately identify the inheritance tax relating to property, including the family home, inherited by children from parents from within the overall yield from the tax without conducting an extensive investigation of the individual Revenue records.The figures of net receipts from all inheritance tax for the years 2002 to 2006 are as follows:Year20022003200420052006Inheritance Tax Yield€128.06m€130.65m€171.29m€196.65m€299.37m

The cost of psychotherapy sessions will qualify for tax relief where such sessions are -: the services of a practitioner; or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner.For this purpose, "practitioner" means any person who is (a) registered in the register established under section 26 of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, (b) registered in the register established under section 26 of the Dentists Act 1985, or (c) in relation to health care provided outside the State, entitled under the laws of the country in which the care is provided to practice medicine or dentistry there.It is not possible to provide an estimate of the full year cost of extending the scope of health expenses relief to cover psychotherapy services (beyond those who may currently qualify) as such cost would depend on the extent to which the relief was utilised.  In common with all tax reliefs, health expenses relief, including its scope, is reviewed on a regular basis by my Department in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill.  Such reviews are not usually the subject of formal published reports.

The Commissioners of Public Works are in discussion with Waterford City Council to see if an economically and environmentally sustainable scheme can be devised.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	583	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the scope for reducing the VAT rate on environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent to the reduced rate of 13.5 per cent. I should state that this is just one of a number of Government initiatives in the Programme aimed at delivering a cleaner environment. In carrying out this examination account will be taken of the growing range of environmental and renewable energy products which present opportunities to reduce our dependence on conventional energy systems and can make a contribution to tackling Climate Change. Energy-saving products and systems including those mentioned by the Deputy will be considered during the exercise. As for all goods and services, the VAT treatment of environmental goods and services is subject to EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.It is important however to point out that, while the supply of insulation materials and renewable energy systems is subject to the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent, the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5 per cent may currently be applied where these products are supplied and installed as a single contract and where the VAT-exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT-exclusive charge to the customer. I understand that the bulk of supply and install contracts are likely to meet this so-called "two-thirds" rule, resulting in the reduced VAT rate of 13.5 per cent rate being applied. Consequently, under existing VAT arrangements, the reduced VAT rate can apply to environmental products where they form part of such a supply and installation arrangement.The reduced VAT rate of 13.5 per cent also currently applies to the supply of all fuel products, including wood pellets, used for home heating and light. Ireland is one of only eight Member States that apply a reduced VAT rate to the supply of fuel products used for home heating and light. The purpose of our proposed VAT review is to examine whether there is scope within EU VAT law to further extend the scope of the application of the reduced VAT rate in the area of environmental goods and services. This and other measures under the Programme for Government clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to addressing the environmental challenges which we face.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	584	There are several parties involved in the management of the lands at the Castletown demesne and environs. The Office of Public Works manages the House and adjacent buildings at Castletown and approx. 120 acres of the original 550 acre demesne. Coillte owns some 120 acres of woodlands of the original demesne, Kildare County Council (KCC) has taken in charge some 25 acres approx. on the south side of the river and the balance of land surrounding Castletown is owned by a private company.The current programme of development works being undertaken at the House by the Office of Public Works involves a significant investment in upgrading the visitor facilities and services in the main house and in the west wing. The aim is to bring the facilities and the presentation of the House up to modern standards befitting one of the major heritage sites in the country. The current works are part of a planned phased development programme that will see, ultimately, the creation of a significant enhanced public amenity at Castletown. One of the main elements in this will be the development of the OPW managed grounds at Castletown together with the adjoining lands owned by KCC and Coillte into an integrated public parkland area with linked pathways across the river and through the woods. Other aspects of the works are summarised in the attached appendix.There has been considerable ongoing discussion with local residents and other interested parties on the works programme at Castletown. From the outset OPW held several meetings with resident groups and kept local interests informed insofar as possible of what was happening and what was planned. It is acknowledged that there has been some concern expressed recently by certain people in the area at the lack of access due to the closure of the Celbridge Gate for renovation work. This was necessary for health and safety reasons. The OPW has endeavoured to assure people that there will continue to be public access to the Castletown grounds and, as indicated above, it is planned to considerably enhance the public walking amenities in the grounds and surrounding lands. In the interest of proper traffic management and public safety, it is planned that the main traffic entrance to Castletown will be from the M4 motorway.AppendixCastletown House — Summary of WorksThe two historic vistas to Connolly's Obelisk and to the Wonderful Barn have been re-opened during the winter and spring. This has been achieved by the OPW with the co-operation of the two landowners who own the land upon which these vistas exist. The Obelisk has been made a National Monument and a 2 year conservation project on it has commenced. The objective is to achieve public access to the viewing platform in the Obelisk subject to conservation and health and safety issues being resolved.  The Batty Langley Lodge which was acquired by the OPW in December 2006 will be conserved commencing in the autumn of 2007 in collaboration with the Irish Landmark Trust.  Planning permission was sought and received from Kildare County Council in 2005 to extend railings around the Main House. These railings will help to protect the House from anti-social behaviour and damage. A new Entrance Gate and railings will be erected at the Celbridge Avenue entrance; this will incorporate two dedicated pedestrian entranceways to coincide with re- opening of House on the 22nd of July, 2007.A new exhibition space has been created in the Main Block of Castletown House for temporary exhibitions and will open in July with a prestigious exhibition called Art of the State "Journeys" with artworks drawn from the OPW's State Art Collection and the Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland's Art Collection. A new Café/Restaurant will re-open in the West Wing of Castletown and be managed by Claire Hanley Catering. There will be new Visitor Service facilities for visitors to include a new Reception and Ticket Office, space to leave buggies, coats, bags etc. In time, and depending on the availability of funds, it is planned also to redevelop the East Wing of the House into a conference and event venue.

Important policy issues in the medium-term include: developing our innovation potential, improving the regulatory environment, enhancing the human capital of our country and developing our economic and technological infrastructure. By bolstering Ireland's competitiveness these, in turn, should raise living standards, improve the quality of life and lay the foundations for future growth.In this context, the National Development Plan for the period 2007-2013 will further enhance our economic and social infrastructure, notably in the key areas of Transport, Environmental Services, Social and Affordable Housing, Health, Education, Broadband and Energy. In addition, investment in support of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and investment in Education at all levels with a particular emphasis on the third and fourth — that is PhD — levels in tandem with continued investment in labour force training and lifelong learning will ensure that we are well prepared to face the challenges ahead. The new Government is also keen to enhance our competitiveness as a location for new internationally-mobile research-related investment.  Recognising that Research and Development (R&D) is the key to a more knowledge-intensive economy aimed at providing a sustainable long-term basis for growth in employment and incomes, the last Government introduced a tax credit for R&D in 2004.  Improvements to the tax credit scheme were announced in this year's Budget.The aim of the tax credit scheme is to encourage existing overseas and indigenous firms to add research functions to their operations in Ireland or to increase their level of research activity.  This, combined with our single 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate on trading profits in all sectors, will continue to support the necessary stable enterprise environment which Ireland has so carefully nurtured through the years, and help to underpin our economic and social development going forward.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	586	While the promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland.  This scheme, which received the necessary EU State Aid approval, commenced in November 2006 and will:provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;cost over €200m over 5 years;when fully operational, result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2009;help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, andstimulate activity in the agricultural sector.As a complementary measure, I provided in Finance Act 2006 for a 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles (cars designed to operate on biofuels) for an initial period of two years.The overall level of excise relief available for biofuels under the above mentioned scheme is that which had been proposed by the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in advance of Budget 2006.  It is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland's output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the coming years. These fiscal incentives were designed to kickstart the domestic biofuels industry and the evidence suggests that this is happening.The Deputy might wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote biofuels and reach the targets referred to. To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government recently announced its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, with targets for market penetration for biofuels of 5.75% in 2009 and 10% by 2020. The scheme is included in the Programme for Government in conjunction with a commitment to work with our EU partners to require biofuels used in transport to comply with an environmental certification system which incorporates sustainability criteria in terms of biofuel production.

The matter of the introduction of a carbon tax is one of the issues to be considered by the new Commission on Taxation to be established under the Programme. Consequently, at this stage, the precise design of such a tax has yet to be determined. This will, of course, form an important part of the normal deliberative process of the Government in setting fiscal and environmental policy. All relevant issues, including the effect a carbon tax may have on home heating and transport costs, will be taken into account in consideration of the proposal. The Deputy will recall, however, that the Programme for Government indicates that the phasing-in of a carbon levy will be on a revenue neutral basis, so it is not intended that its introduction will lead to any net Exchequer revenue increase or net addition to the overall tax burden.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	589	Over ten thousand six hundred civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Programme. Of these, approximately 5,600 or 53% are currently based in Dublin. The Central Applications Facility remains open and continues to receive applications.  Discussions have concluded on a number of human resource and industrial relations matters and are being progressed on other issues.  At the end of April 2007, over 2,700 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts. It is expected that over 1,000 will be in place this summer in over 20 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 33 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred. The precise numbers moving within that time frame will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment. The property programme is well advanced.  The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis. Based on its experience to date in relation to timeframes for property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements, it has provided an updated schedule of the likely availability of accommodation.This schedule allows for the planned movement of up to 6,800 staff in the next three years in line with the timeframes set out in the June 2005 report of the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG).  The delivery time for some locations will be later than originally projected, however, leading to a greater concentration of moves in 2009 rather than in 2008. Matters outside the control of the OPW, which could give rise to delay, will continue to be monitored and mitigating action taken where possible.  Discussions are ongoing with the unions representing professional & technical staff in the Civil Service on the range of industrial relations issues arising, including promotion arrangements and placing of staff who wish to remain in Dublin.Thirty State Agencies are due to relocate under the Government's Decentralisation Programme. Some 2,340 posts are involved, or just over 22% of the programme. The DIG did not set specific timeframes for the State Agencies as they believed that it was the responsibility of the board and senior management of each agency to implement the Government decision and to report to its "parent" department in the first instance on the progress being made.  The DIG noted in its latest Report that while progress has been made by some State agencies, there has been a marked lack of action in some other agencies. The Group is currently meeting with CEOs from a number of State agencies to get an overview of progress to date and to identify the challenges remaining in implementing the Government policy.The main issues facing the State agencies are those relating to the filling of posts in undersubscribed locations, the placing of staff choosing to remain in Dublin and promotion arrangements. These issues are the subject of ongoing contacts between my Department and ICTU.  An approach based on negotiations and agreement has enabled significant progress to be made in relation to the Civil Service moves and it is the intention to continue with this policy in relation to the State Agency sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	590	When the Government's Decentralisation Programme was first announced, it was stated that the overall objective would be to ensure that property being acquired at a regional level is matched as closely as possible, both in time and in cost terms, by the disposal of property currently held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise.  In November 2004 the Decentralisation Implementation Group prepared a report on the procurement methodology and financial assessment of the property aspects of the programme, including a financial model, based on a property finance study carried out by the Office of Public Works.  While the prevailing property market conditions in each area will have a bearing on cost, this model indicates that the break even position in relation to property will be reached in about 20 years.Initial costings of the Decentralisation Programme estimated a gross cost of approximately €900m in respect of procuring sites and office accommodation for the Programme.  This financial model for the Programme also includes estimates of receipts from sales of State owned property in Dublin which will be surplus to requirements post-decentralisation.  The financial model is currently being updated by OPW.  While individual aspects of the underlying assumptions may have changed, current indications are that the property elements of the original Programme will come in within the overall envelope of €900m (in 2004 prices).  In terms of actual outlay to date, the total amount committed in principle by the OPW on site acquisition costs, excluding VAT, is approximately €79 million.  Expenditure to date is approximately €49 million.  A study was commissioned by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) which provides a model for identifying non-property costs and savings that arise both during the relocation phase and in the context of a post-decentralised civil service.  Decentralising organisations have been asked to use this model to make periodic reports identifying non-property costs incurred and savings made both since the programme was announced and in its implementation in the future.  At the end of June, the total non-property costs incurred amount to €6.8m.

If the criteria of the ophthalmic scheme are met an authorisation to attend for the sight test will issue to the individual who may then avail of the service.   In the normal course of events, a letter from a doctor is not required.

Part 2 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act. The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act will be extended to adults as soon as possible but no later than 2011. In order to part facilitate the Implementation of Part II of the Disability Act an additional sum of €75m, for revenue purposes, was provided to the Health Service Executive for Disability Services in the 2007 Budget.  This sum incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism.The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

This phase includes the fit out of the existing ward shells, the refurbishment of the existing paediatric and obstetric wards and an interim Special Care Baby Unit.   The HSE has advised that the fit out of the existing ward shells is scheduled for completion by the end of September. These wards will then be utilised to facilitate the completion of the refurbishment of the existing paediatric and obstetric wards and the development of the interim Special Care Baby Unit.The second stage of the project, which proposes to increase the bed complement to 324, is estimated to cost in the region of €48 million.  It includes a new Acute Psychiatric Department, an Intensive Care Unit, a new Medicine for Elderly/Rehabilitation Unit, increased capacity in the Medical Assessment Unit and increased capacity for day procedures.  In accordance with Department of Finance requirements, any capital project in the Health Sector costing more than €30 million requires a detailed cost benefit analysis.  My Department is advised by the HSE that this analysis has now been completed in respect of the second stage of the Phase 2B development at Mullingar and is due to be considered by the Executive shortly.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	599	There has been a growing demand for and investment in therapy services over the last number of years.  A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of physiotherapy graduates.  Training places for physiotherapists have increased by 134% (from 64 to 150) while the number of physiotherapists employed in the public health service has risen by 130% (from 593 to 1,364) since 1997.The provision of additional physiotherapy services through developments in a number of service areas has been prioritised in recent years.  A number of additional physiotherapists will be employed as a result of additional funding provided for new developments in 2006 and 2007.  Additional physiotherapists will be required, for example, for the extension of the home care package scheme, the development of primary care teams and networks and the enhancement of the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services in the disability sector.  However, I am aware that a situation emerged whereby some 2006 physiotherapy graduates had difficulty in obtaining employment in the public health service.  My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, undertook to address this situation in a proactive manner and made significant progress in creating employment opportunities for these graduates.  In this regard, my Department is continuing to chair a working group comprising representatives from the HSE, the therapy managers and IMPACT.  The Group has identified the contributing factors and has developed an action plan with a view to addressing these factors to minimise similar difficulties for 2007 graduates.  The group is now working through prioritised actions and continues to make progress on several key actions.I understand that the HSE is reviewing the current panel for basic grade physiotherapists with a view to establishing a new basic grade physiotherapy panel as soon as possible.  As a result of the proactive approach taken by my Department and the HSE, I understand that a large majority of the 2006 graduates are now employed.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people's care needs are met in the primary care setting.Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties. Between 2000 and 2006 approximately €139 million was allocated to the HSE for out of hours GP co-operatives. In 2007,  the HSE Vote includes almost  €34 million in baseline funding for these services and a further €3 million  to meet the full year cost of Co-op developments commenced in 2006.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	633	My Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  The review of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI) Agreements, with the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, was completed in mid-2006 and the new agreements are in place.Following completion of the manufacturer agreements and in line with the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health, the State entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor's Federation (PDF).  As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, the State intended to negotiate direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector, to address the cost of wholesale supply to hospital and community through fair, transparent and accountable cost structures.  In particular, the State wished to examine the high margin, relative to the EU,  for wholesale supply to community pharmacy and the wholesalers' claim that they supply hospitals at a loss.Early in discussions, PDF refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply, based on its own legal advice.  Subsequent advice to the HSE, confirmed by the Attorney General's office and Senior Counsel engaged by the Attorney General, indicated that, under section 4 of the Competition Act 2002, PDF as an association of undertakings may not collectively negotiate fees, prices or margins on behalf of its members.  Given this position, and the fact that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is also an association of undertakings, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins and such negotiations place these bodies at risk of prosecution.The State had intended to address the review of community pharmacy, and in particular how to improve value for money and transparency and fairness in relation to service provision, through negotiation with the IPU, as it had in the past, but this is no longer possible.  Accordingly, the negotiating team re-considered, in light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, how best to address the review of pharmacy contractor services.  Following consultation with the IPU, a procedure was agreed to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  This process, chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC, has commenced.The State continues to recognise the IPU as the representative body for its members, but negotiations with the Union must comply with the law.  The legal issues that emerged during the wholesale sector review were raised by the wholesaler representatives.  Once the State became aware of these issues, it was no longer possible to continue as intended.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU as the representative body for pharmacists, within the constraints of the competition legislation and the negotiating team will consider, in the context of competition law and in particular the relevant Competition Authority guidelines, all available options for advancing the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  I am satisfied that the Cabinet Committee process for review of the supply of drugs to the State is progressing effectively, within the constraints of relevant legislation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors. These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	635	As the Deputy may be aware, responsibility for training of people with disabilities rested with the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB), prior to June 2000. Arising from the Government decision on mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities, the NRB was dissolved in June 2000 and responsibility for vocational training for people with disabilities was transferred from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and was vested in FÁS. Responsibility for rehabilitative training and sheltered work remained with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Boards.Prior to June 2000, some categories of FÁS trainees, who are regarded as socially disadvantaged, e.g. travellers, lone parents, received a training bonus of £25 (€31.75) per week. This entitlement was extended by FÁS to people with disabilities in vocational training. In the interests of equity, the Department of Health and Children responded to the FÁS decision by introducing a similar payment (the rehabilitative training bonus) for rehabilitative trainees. As the Department of Health and Children's payment is linked to the FÁS payment, any consideration of a change in the rate is dependant on a prior decision being taken by FÁS to change the rate.The Deputy's question also refers to an allowance payable to service users attending sheltered workshops. This payment,  (known as a top-up payment to sheltered workers) is paid at the discretion of the service provider and is not a statutory payment.  Therefore neither the Department of Health and Children nor the Health Service Executive is in a position to review such a payment.

The HSE proposes to expand public capacity by 397 beds in 2007 and by 408 in 2008.  The running costs in full year of this additional public capacity will be €42m.In 2006, the HSE contracted a total of 1,050 extra beds in the private nursing home sector. A total of €28m is being allocated to cover the full year cost in 2007 of these beds.  In addition, the HSE is planning to contract a further 350 beds in 2007 at a cost of €12m.  220 of these will be procured in the Greater Dublin area and 100 will be procured in HSE South.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to provide the particular details requested by the Deputy in respect of the waiting list numbers for each of the long-term care facilities in the greater Dublin area.

I identified this as a key priority in 2006 and again in 2007.  Development funding of €4.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2006 to facilitate the recruitment of additional medical, nursing and allied health professional staff to improve services for cystic fibrosis patients. Additional funding of €2 million has been allocated this year to build on the investment provided in 2006.I also asked the HSE to address in particular the identified deficits at the national adult referral centre at St. Vincent's University Hospital.  My Department is advised by the HSE that recent interim improvements at the hospital have resulted in additional capacity for persons with cystic fibrosis. In addition, the HSE has approved the establishment of a Project Team to progress the next phase of the ongoing major capital development at St. Vincent's.  A new Unit for persons with cystic fibrosis has been identified by the HSE as one of a number of priority projects to be included in the development.In 2005, the HSE established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The Working Group has completed its work and publication of its report is a matter for the Executive.With regard to cross border co-operation, the HSE has advised my Department that it will review the need and demand for such a service and seek to make the necessary service arrangements where appropriate. My Department will be happy to provide any assistance in this regard if required by the Executive.Finally, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the additional service issues raised investigated and to reply directly to the relevant Deputies.

Responsibility for delivery of health services is a matter for the HSE.The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, contains provision for the amendment of Section 66 of the Health Act, 1970 to provide for a health examination and treatment service for pupils attending any primary school.  The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, also contains provision for the amendment of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1994 to provide dental health services to children attending any primary school.  The relevant sections of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which give legal effect to these changes were commenced on the 1st May last. My officials are currently in discussion with the Health Service Executive with a view to beginning the early roll out of this scheme.

This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  Home Care Packages (HCPs) which include Home Care Cash Grants are designed to1.Support older people to continue to live in their community.2.Reduce inappropriate admission3.Facilitate timely discharge of older people from acute hospitals4.Reduce pressure on A&E departmentsThe Health Service Executive is responsible for the operation of Home Care Packages.  Referral for packages can be made by any health professional whether community or hospital based. The decision to allocate a HCP is based on the assessment of needs of the individual and the identification of any assessed needs which are not being met by mainstream services, together with consideration of the appropriateness of care in the community in the individual case. Home Care Packages are therefore an additional support over and above existing mainstream community services and are designed to enhance rather than replace existing home support services.In 2006 a total of 2,000 extra Home Care Packages were provided at a full year cost of €55 million.  A similar increase in the number of packages will be provided in 2007 and a sum of €18m will fund the cost of 0.78 million additional home help hours in 2007.  On the 2nd April 2007 Section 93 of the Finance Act was signed into law exempting under certain circumstances private homecare services from VAT.A joint working group comprising representatives of my Department and the Health Service Executive is currently examining planning the staffing requirements for future developments in relation to HCPs.  It is anticipated that the group will report to Government by the end of 2007.A Steering Committee is being set up to begin the preparatory work of evaluating the effectiveness of the additional Home Care Packages.  Following the results of this evaluation my Department will be in a position to make any further decisions necessary in this area.Bearing in mind the significant resources that have been put in place in recent times, and the measures that have been introduced or are planned to monitor HCPs, I am satisfied that this important initiative has brought significant benefits to clients and their families availing of the service and that further improvements where necessary will be introduced in the light of operational experience.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	688	The Government's policy on radiation oncology is based on the Report on ‘The Development of Radiation Oncology Serves in Ireland'.  The Report was prepared by a multi-disciplinary group of experts in radiation oncology, medical oncology, public health and palliative care, including significant expertise from St. Luke's Hospital and the Irish Cancer Society.  The Report has had significant international endorsement from such bodies as the US National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society.  The Report recommended that there should be two radiation oncology treatment centres located in the Eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas.  A detailed request for proposals issued to six hospitals in Dublin in June 2004 and an International Panel submitted its advice to me in January 2005.The decision to transfer St. Luke's Hospital was taken by the Government in the context of this advice and its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place last year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke's.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke's are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke's will lead the management team of the new facility at St. James's.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke's to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group which is advising me on progress on the implementation of the plan.Discussions on transfer, facilitated by the HSE, are taking place involving the Chief Executives of both hospitals.  A working group is in place to develop close working relationships and ensure a smooth transition.  In addition and in recognition of the role for St. Luke's in the new facility at St. James's, I will pursue discussions with the Boards of both Hospitals about its governance and a re-configuration of the Boards.  The twin goals are to ensure continuity of expertise and ethos in the care of cancer patients and the effective integration of multi-disciplinary patient care at the one site.

In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.

The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The Act does not withdraw eligibility for public hospital services from road traffic accident victims, but allows the Health Service Executive to recover the costs of all services provided to them.  As I have insufficient information in relation to this specific case, I have asked the HSE to investigate this matter and I will reply to the Deputy once I have received the necessary information from the HSE.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year implementation timeframe.  "A Vision for Change" acknowledges gaps in the current provision of child and adolescent mental health services and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.  The report recommends that child and adolescent mental health services should provide mental health services to all aged 0-18 years.An audit of child and adolescent mental health teams was carried out by the Health Service Executive in March 2007.  At this time there was 45.6 whole time equivalent consultant psychiatrists and 48.04 whole time equivalent clinical psychologists on these teams.  There were 3.66 whole time equivalent consultant psychiatrist vacancies and 12 whole time equivalent clinical psychologist vacancies.  It is important to note that multidisciplinary child and adolescent mental health teams also include registrars, social workers, occupational therapists, nurses, childcare workers, other therapists and administrative support staff.In 2006, €3.25 million was provided for the enhancement of child and adolescent services including the development of eight new multidisciplinary teams.  A further €7.95 million has been provided in 2007 to significantly improve both community and hospital based services and facilitate the provision of early intervention services.  The multidisciplinary nature of existing child and adolescent mental health teams will be enhanced and a further eight new teams will be developed in 2007.

The scheme will require new legislation.  In the interim, as of 1 January 2007 there are no longer three separate rates for subvention.  Persons who apply may receive any amount up to a maximum of €300 per week.  Persons who are already in receipt of subvention may re-apply to the HSE as they may now be eligible for an increased payment.  Persons who have previously been refused a subvention may also re-apply to the HSE as they may now be eligible for a payment.Furthermore, in reviewing all cases, the HSE will ensure that income is only imputed from the principal private residence for the first three years of a person's stay in a nursing home from the date of admission.  This means applicants who may have been refused subvention in the past may benefit from the 15% cap on imputation of income from the principal private residence.

It particularly highlights the need to develop a high quality, responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards.  It recommends that there be one major regional hospital in the North East, supported by the five existing local hospitals.  The new hospital is to provide emergency and trauma services on a 24 hour basis and also provide planned specialist procedures that are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital.The hospital reconfiguration process is being overseen by the HSE Steering Group which is leading the project.  A sub-committee of the Steering Group was established to progress the issue of site selection for the new regional hospital.  Following a tendering process, the HSE appointed consultants to carry out an independent site location study. The study, which the HSE expects to be finalised in August, will take account of various criteria including demographics, access, planning and development considerations and interdependencies.The first step in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the North East have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency in-patient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, services at the existing five hospitals will continue to be improved.  My Department has been advised that the existing hospitals will continue to provide services which meet the majority of health needs of the community.The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of the Teamwork Report, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	700	Since the beginning of 2005 the medical card assessment guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  Other significant changes which I have introduced are that applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work.  In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive (HSE) a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.In assessing eligibility, the HSE uses national guidelines to assess people's means, which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of other factors which may impact on people's ability to meet the cost of GP services.  Under the assessment arrangements, persons whose sole income is derived from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the assessment guidelines, qualify for a medical card.Since January 2005 to June 2007 an additional 166,591 people have free access to GP services.  This figure consists of an additional 98,383 people with a medical card and a further 68,208 people with a GP visit card.  I have no immediate plans to change the guidelines used in the assessment process. My Department and the HSE monitor on an ongoing basis the number of medical cards and GP visit cards, and the need for changes to the guidelines is kept under review, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.

Arising from these offers approximately 1,800 repayments with a value of approximately €38m have been made to date.  This rate of repayment is lower than had been projected. I understand from the HSE that this is due to a number of factors including the legal and technical requirements, a high level of deficiencies in the application forms submitted to the scheme administrator and complexities in the operation of the probate process.In accordance with the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 priority has been given to repaying living applicants as they were most immediately affected.  However, the repayments to estates has now commenced.  In relation to elderly widows or widowers of deceased persons and the priority that should be given to their claims, the HSE has put additional resources in place to encourage both the completion of application forms for clients in vulnerable client groups and to ensure that these claims (in particular where there is an elderly spouse who could benefit) are processed as quickly as possible.The HSE is monitoring the operation of the repayment scheme and has agreed a range of initiatives with the scheme administrator to speed up the repayment process. The closing date for receipt of applications is 31st December 2007 and I have been informed by the HSE that final repayments should be made by mid 2008.

The initiative for the removal of these restrictions rests with the EU Commission and I would support any moves which the Commission may make in this regard.With respect to Ireland, the Pharmacy Act 2007 will remove the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries from owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old — the derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC.  My motivation in removing this "derogation" was to facilitate the many Irish pharmacy graduates who, because of the shortage of pharmacy undergraduate places available in the State, went abroad to train.  On their return these graduates found that they were at a disadvantage to their Irish trained colleagues in not being able to establish a new pharmacy business, having instead to confine themselves to ones which had already been in operation for at least 3 years, a situation that was clearly unfair and unsustainable.

The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive. It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences.The Deputy will be aware that demands for assessment for inter-country adoption are continuously increasing. It should be noted that consequent on the increased number of children coming from abroad, there is also a new and increasing demand for post-adoption reports for sending countries. These are also being undertaken by HSE social work staff.  In a number of areas, the HSE have increased capacity through contract arrangements with non-statutory agencies with appropriate expertise. Officials from my office are currently engaged in discussions with the HSE to explore these and other strategies to increase capacity across the country.

This list is reviewed and amended monthly, as new products become available and deletions are notified.  For an item to be reimbursed, it must comply with published criteria, including authorisation status as appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product.  In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.  Products are considered for reimbursement on application by a supplier.Under Clause 9.1 of the agreement recently negotiated between the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Health Service Executive on the supply terms, conditions and prices of medicines supplied to the health services, manufacturers, importers or their agents, who experience foreseeable or prolonged stock shortages, or the possibility of such shortages, must notify the HSE as soon as they become aware of the problem.  Furthermore, the supplier shall endeavour to source, within the notice period, an alternative supply.In this particular instance the manufacturer concerned notified the Health Service Executive in a notice dated 15 February 2007 that supplies of Tilade were in short supply.  It was the company's intention to replace the Tilade with a CFC free version of the product.  However, due to unforeseen administrative difficulties  the CFC free version of this product will not, according to the company, become widely available until July.  I understand that the manufacturer concerned has undertaken to source an alternative supply of this product and make it available for patients who require it.

This process will take account of the Department of Health and Children's document "Diabetes: Prevention and Model for Patient Care". The group has identified as one of its priorities the development of an Integrated Care Model for the treatment of Diabetes.  This model will focus on the joint participation of hospital consultants and general practitioners in the planned delivery of care for patients. The Expert Advisory Group has also identified the other areas of diabetes care that need priority attention such as retinopathy screening, pediatric diabetes, patient education and empowerment, and podiatry. It should be noted that the diabetic retinopathy screening to prevent eye diseases in diabetes sufferers is currently being rolled out in the Western region and in North Dublin.In addition my Department and the HSE are currently finalising a series of measures to manage the health impacts of chronic disease generally in the population.  These measures include:—The development of a comprehensive, integrated chronic disease policy framework which will view chronic disease as a continuum with "upstream" action on the avoidable cause of disease, disability and premature death (including in particular inter-sectoral action to address the wider determinants of health) as well as "downstream" action to improve the health and quality of life of those already suffering from the condition;Comprehensive patient registration systems;The development of shared care models for each condition under a disease management programme;The development and use of evidence-based clinical guidelines for each condition;A Self-Care Management Programme; andQuality assurance and evaluation Protocols.In Budget 2007, €4 million was approved for the funding of Chronic diseases and an additional €1 million to be given in 2008. This funding includes the prevention and treatment of diabetes.The remaining issues raised in the Deputy's questions relate to the funding, management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	725	As the Deputy may be aware, an additional sum of €75m for revenue purposes was provided to the Health Service Executive for Disability Services in the 2007 Budget.  This sum incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism.The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	727	Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular issue raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	728	The Primary Care Strategy aims to support and promote the health and well-being of the population by developing  multi-disciplinary teams of professionals, including general practitioners, which enable the vast majority of people's health and social care needs to be met in their local community.   I recognise that in order to support and facilitate this model of care, general practitioners need to have access to appropriate diagnostic services so that, as far as possible and as appropriate, the diagnosis and the management of illness can take place in the community rather than the hospital setting.The Health Service Executive has, I understand, undertaken a number of measures to enhance access for GPs to x-ray and ultrasound services for patients.  As the  Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to provide more detailed information in this regard.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	729	Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

They went out to public consultation in October last year and I understand they have received a substantial number of suggestions and proposals as a result of this process.  The RSA also engaged in a process of direct consultation with key stakeholders in December 2006. The volume of submissions received from these processes were examined by the Authority who are now working towards the finalisation of the new Strategy.  When I receive the new Road Safety Strategy I will submit it to Government for approval as soon as possible thereafter.

It includes rankings on the three most important aspects of road user behaviour in Europe — speed, alcohol and seat belt wearing and relates to the period 2001 to 2005.  Ireland ranks thirteenth out of the EU twenty five based on road deaths per million of population in 2005.Achieving progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing has been central to the implementation of Ireland's national Road Safety Strategy. Significant initiatives have been achieved since 2005 including the introduction of a new system of metric speed limits, the further extension of the operation of the penalty points and fixed charge systems from April 2006, the establishment of the Garda Traffic Corps, hard hitting safety awareness campaigns, new legislation, tougher fines and penalties, and the introduction of roadside Mandatory Alcohol Testing.Other major proposals, such as the plans to establish a system of private sector operation of speed cameras under the auspices of the Gardaí, are well advanced.The Report does not reflect the significant developments and reduction in fatalities on our roads since 2006 when the number of deaths, at 368, was the second lowest rate in forty years. This downward trend has continued into 2007 with 35 less fatalities on 22 June 2007 than on the same day in 2006.  These significant improvements will be reflected in the EU rankings when the next review is published.

The review did not recommend inclusion of the scheme in the list of new rail schemes.  On this basis the project was not included in Transport 21.  My predecessor met representatives of the Midlands Railway Action Group on a number of occasions to discuss the matter.  I understand also that the matter was also discussed with Iarnród Éireann on the basis of a report commissioned by the group.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	735	Transport 21 provides for the re-opening of the Western Rail Corridor between Ennis and Claremorris on a phased basis.  The Ennis to Athenry section is to be completed in 2008, the Athenry to Tuam section in 2010 and the Tuam to Claremorris section in 2014. Iarnród Eireann plan to have Phase 1 completed in 2008.  I understand from Iarnród Éireann that route clearance, site investigation works and excavations for improved bridge clearance are already under way.I do not consider it prudent to release commercially sensitive information in relation to the cost of individual projects within Transport 21 until the public procurement processes are completed.  However, my Department has allocated €10m in 2007 to Iarnród Éireann to fund expenditure on Phase 1 (Ennis — Athenry section) of the Western Rail Corridor.Iarnród Éireann, with the assistance of funding under the Clár programme, are undertaking work to preserve the rail alignment on the Claremorris to Collooney section in line with Transport 21. This is prior to examining the feasibility of reopening the line from Claremorris to Sligo, as provided for in the Programme for Government.

Under these arrangements, Dublin Bus is now operating routes 33X and 142 for travel through the Dublin Port Tunnel.Separately, my Department has an application from a private operator to provide a commercial express bus service, without State subvention, from Swords to the City Centre, via the Dublin Port Tunnel. This application was made prior to receipt of a notification from Dublin Bus for a service along a similar route.In accordance with standard regulatory procedures, the application from the private bus operator, made under the provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, has to be considered first and is currently under consideration. Hence, the Dublin Bus application has to await the decision on the prior application and Dublin Bus has been advised of this.I recognise the importance of the licensing regime governing the bus sector being in keeping with consumer needs for the provision of a quality public transport system. I accept that the Road Transport Act, 1932 and the Transport Act, 1958 are in need of reform and I will be pursuing this in line with the commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to reforming bus licensing to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants.

This power is applied through the provision of a regulatory prohibition on parking signs specifying a weight threshold at the entrance to an area.Any large vehicle, whose unladen weight exceeds the weight specified, is restricted from parking in that area except for a period of time not exceeding 30 minutes from the commencement of parking while goods are being loaded or unloaded.No road authority has been in contact with my Department to convey any indication that the current legislative provision is not ample to prohibit the parking of heavy goods vehicle cabs in any residential area.The RPA has received many, and sometimes irreconcilable requests, from residents along the route of Metro North.  On 15 June, RPA wrote to over 2,000 residents setting out the current status of work and committing to follow up with an analysis of other tunnel alignment options that would make greater use of green space. When these options have been further developed, RPA will write to all affected residents again enclosing details of the options and seeking comments on them.  It is important to note that whichever route is chosen will pass beneath houses, businesses and other buildings.A programme to address concerns expressed about the location of the DCU stop has also been put in place by the RPA.The comments of residents will feed into the overall environmental assessment of the options so that the detailed tunnel alignment and stop locations for this portion of Metro North can be finalised in order to make a Railway Order application to An Bord Pleanála.

The capacity on the Maynooth line, in particular, has trebled in the last 5 years.  The opening of the Docklands Station in March has also provided a significant increase in capacity on this line.  As part of Transport 21, Iarnród Éireann also propose to resignal the city centre area and to electrify the Maynooth line to provide faster journey times and increased frequencies and planning in relation to these projects is already under way.

My Department has provided funding of almost €11m to Iarnród Éireann to fund additional car parking spaces at various stations along the rail network including the Kildare and Maynooth lines.  These improvement works are due for completion by the end of 2007 and will increase the total car parking available at these stations by over 1600 spaces.This funding will also cover the costs of feasibility studies by Irish Rail on a car park expansion programme.In addition, car park provision will form part of major new railway infrastructure works such as the Kildare Route Project and the Navan Rail Link.The capacity and frequency of services on the railway network have been substantially increased in recent years.  Capacity on the Maynooth line has trebled in the last 5 years.  The opening of the Docklands Station in March has also provided a significant increase in capacity on this line.

Whilst it was very clear that there is overwhelming public support for the concept of Metro North serving Ballymun it was also clear that a significant majority of those consulted were in favour of an underground option.In April 2007 the Board of the RPA approved the underground (cut and cover) option as the preferred alignment for Metro North through Ballymun. Since the RPA Board were in the best position to reach this conclusion, the Minister considered it appropriate that he should accept this decision.This design change will require an adjustment to the capital envelope for the project. It is my intention that any necessary adjustment to the capital envelope for Metro North will be met from within the overall Transport 21 capital envelope.

Metro North will have 15 stops, including ones at DCU, Griffith Avenue and Drumcondra.The Railway Procurement Agency are at present preparing of an Environmental Impact Statement and other documentation required to support an application to An Bord Pleanála for a Railway Order (the legal permission needed to build and operate Metro North).The RPA continues to engage extensively with residents along the route of Metro North in exploring mechanisms for addressing their concerns (including concerns about the location of the Griffith Avenue and DCU stops and the tunnel alignment between Drumcondra and Griffith Avenue).  The RPA have also responded to individual queries raised by residents and businesses and have had meetings with many of these stakeholders to discuss their concerns.The RPA has received many, and sometimes irreconcilable requests, from residents along the route of Metro North.  On 15 June, RPA wrote to over 2,000 residents setting out the current status of work and committing to follow up with an analysis of other tunnel alignment options that would make greater use of green space. When these options have been further developed, RPA will write to all affected residents again enclosing details of the options and seeking comments on them.  It is important to note that whichever route is chosen will pass beneath houses, businesses and other buildings.A programme to address concerns expressed about the location of the DCU stop has also been put in place by the RPA.The comments of residents will feed into the overall environmental assessment of the options so that the detailed tunnel alignment and stop locations for this portion of Metro North can be finalised in order to make a Railway Order application to An Bord Pleanála.

Route Option 1 runs west of the M50 via Clondalkin, Liffey Valley and Blanchardstown, (with possible stops at Meakstown and Sillogue). Route Option 2 runs west of Clondalkin via Lucan and Blanchardstown and serving Blanchardstown Institute of Technology and Ballycoolin (with possible stops at Harristown and Sillogue).  Various sub-options have also been identified.Since the RPA could not identify a possible feasible alignment, there are no plans for Metro West to serve Finglas directly.  The possible stop at Meakstown would, however,  serve the northern fringe of the Finglas area.The route finally selected may be a combination or variation of the Options I or 2 or other options identified during the public consultation process which took place November 2006 to February 2007.  Approximately 850 submissions were received by the RPA during this time.  I expect the RPA to make an announcement on the preferred route of Metro West in the near future.

The decision of whether or not to provide a traffic calming measure at any location and the nature of the measure that is deemed to be appropriate is a matter to be determined at local level by each road authority as part of its traffic management role.The regulatory signs to be provided at pedestrian crossings are prescribed in Part V of the Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations 1997. In addition, the Traffic Signs Manual is a statutory directive given to road authorities by the Minister for Transport setting out guidance on the provision and use of traffic signs, including the provision of pedestrian crossings and various traffic calming measures.I have not issued statutory guidelines pursuant to section 38 of the 2004 Act but a non-statutory manual, titled Traffic Management Guidelines, was published jointly in 2003 by my Department, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This publication sets out comprehensive guidelines, best practice and recommended criteria in relation to the deployment of a wide range of traffic calming measures.Copies of each of the publications that I have referred to are available in the Oireachtas library.The RPA has received many, and sometimes irreconcilable requests, from residents along the route of Metro North.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I propose to take Questions Nos. 371, 372 and 375 together.The Government attaches the highest priority to the welfare of the undocumented Irish in the United States, and takes every opportunity in contacts with US political leaders to emphasise the importance of addressing this matter in a sympathetic and pragmatic manner.Immigration reform is one of the most contentious and high profile political issues in the US. Only a bipartisan solution can succeed in reforming the immigration system. However, it is clear that securing the necessary bipartisan consensus on this complex and divisive matter remains a very considerable challenge.There is strong awareness on Capitol Hill of the Irish dimension to the undocumented issue. Our Ambassador in Washington is extremely active in highlighting our concerns, as are officials of our Consulates across the United States. The Taoiseach and I, as well as members of the Oireachtas, have raised the issue with key figures in the US Administration and on Capitol Hill, and have made known our strong support for measures that would be of benefit to the undocumented Irish. Our sustained political contacts have been strengthened by the mobilisation of the Irish community behind the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, a highly effective organisation which we are happy to support, including financially.On May 17th, a bipartisan coalition of US Senators, including Senator Kennedy, reached what has been characterised as a "grand compromise" on comprehensive immigration reform. Very regrettably however, it did not prove possible to move the bill to a final vote on this occasion.Following a meeting on June 12th between President Bush and Republican Senators, and a subsequent announcement by the President of his support for a $4.4 billion initiative on strengthening border security, the Democratic Leader in the Senate and his Republican counterpart announced that the bill is being brought back to the Senate floor. In this regard, a vote is expected to be taken today to determine whether debate will be resumed on the Bill.  The Government will continue to lobby actively for a favourable outcome in the critical period ahead.

There are regular contacts at political and official level, while the economic relationship between the two countries is growing.As I believe the Deputy will appreciate, any expansion of our diplomatic network can only be undertaken having regard to clear priorities. In this regard, and while the opening of new Missions is reviewed by the Government on a regular basis, there are no plans to establish a resident Embassy in the Ukraine at this time.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	757	The Government are completely opposed to the practice of so-called extraordinary rendition, as were the previous Government. Our concerns in relation to this matter have been made clear to the highest levels of the US Government, including by the Taoiseach to President Bush. The Government received specific assurances from the US authorities, confirmed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, that such prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.A number of Garda investigations have confirmed that there is no evidence of any illegal activity related to extraordinary rendition at Irish airports. Where the Gardaí have suspicions about a particular aircraft, they have full powers to board and inspect that aircraft. As I have previously informed the House, the decision to search a particular aircraft, if and when warranted in accordance with law, would be a matter for An Garda Síochána. As the Government have also repeatedly made clear, An Garda Síochána has the powers it needs to investigate all allegations of illegal activity. In addition, there is no legal bar to the search of civilian aircraft of the type allegedly involved where there is a basis for so doing.I have had detailed exchanges with Dr Maurice Manning, the President of the Irish Human Rights Commission, on all issues related to extraordinary rendition, and I have set out the Government's view that we are fully in compliance with our international obligations. I would also note that in their joint statement on extraordinary rendition of 27 June 2006, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Commission of Jurists and the Association for the Prevention of Torture do not call for spot checks, but rather for the inspection of aircraft "where there are grounds for believing... [they are] being used to transport detainees". It has always been the Government's position that in such circumstances, An Garda Síochána should exercise their powers of entry and search of an aircraft.On my instructions, Ireland has taken the lead at EU level in raising possible improvements to the regulation of civil aviation, in particular through the amendment of the 1994 Chicago Convention. We are also in ongoing discussion with fellow-members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in this regard. These discussions are at an early stage, but nonetheless I believe that they may have the potential to be productive. It is clear, however, that for any reforms in this area to be effective, they will require to be implemented at least at the European level.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	758	The use of Shannon airport by aircraft continuing to transport US troops is wholly in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions on Afghanistan and Iraq. In relation to Iraq, UN Security Council Resolutions 1511 and 1546 explicitly call on UN member States to assist the multinational force in Iraq. Subsequent Resolutions have annually renewed the mandate of the multinational forces, noting also that they are there at the request of the Government of Iraq. The current mandate under UNSCR 1723 runs up to the end of 2007.The Programme for Government does not address the above but deals with the quite separate issue of extraordinary rendition and reiterates that the Government are totally opposed to the practice. The Government will ensure that all relevant legal instruments are used so that the practice of extraordinary rendition does not occur in this State in any form, while Ireland will seek EU and international support to address deficiencies in aspects of the regulation of civil aviation under the Chicago Convention. This specific issue is also addressed in my reply of today's date to Deputy Bruton (Ref no. 17445/07).
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	759	The Government is gravely concerned about the plight of the vulnerable people of the Darfur region of Sudan. In cooperation with our international partners, we continue to pursue all possible avenues to provide them with increased security and support.In my direct contacts with the Sudanese Foreign Minister in July and September 2006, I called on his Government to agree to UN engagement in peacekeeping in Darfur, and emphasised the need to make political progress on foot of the Darfur Peace Agreement of May 2006. I also pushed for improved humanitarian access in Darfur to avert further tragic consequences. I have continued to make these points in meetings I have had with states and organisations capable of influencing Sudan, including the United States, Egypt, the Arab League and the UN. I have consistently underlined Ireland's support for a genuine ceasefire, a renewed political process and an effective AU/UN hybrid peacekeeping force. On 26 March 2007, I stated publicly that in the absence of full co-operation between the Government of Sudan and the United Nations, Ireland supports urgent consideration in the UN Security Council of further measures against the Government of Sudan.Ireland has worked unceasingly with our EU partners to ensure protection for the victims of the Darfur crisis. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 18 June 2007, EU Foreign Ministers condemned the Government of Sudan's renewed bombing of civilians, and again noted that the EU is ready to consider further measures (notably in the UN framework) to ensure humanitarian deliveries and the protection of civilians. We stated that those violating the human rights of civilians must be held responsible, and urged the Government of Sudan to comply with the arrest warrants that the International Criminal Court issued in May against two individuals accused of committing atrocities in Darfur.Ireland also supports the UN Human Rights Council's work on human rights abuses in Darfur. We actively supported the holding of a UN Human Rights Council Special Session on Darfur earlier this year, as well as the dispatch of a Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Darfur. The Government supported the decision on 30 March 2007 to establish a high level UN group to work with Sudan on implementing core recommendations in Darfur. These efforts have increased the pressure for improvements on the ground.Although progress remains slow, pressure by the international community has produced some results. The Government of Sudan's statement on 12 June that it accepts the AU/UN hybrid mission is a step in the right direction. The hybrid mission, as described in the joint AU/UN report of 5 June 2007, will be very substantial, will be managed in line with UN standards and will have a mandate to protect civilians from violent attacks, facilitate humanitarian access and contribute to the restoration of security. It is hoped that this force will bring some respite for the people of Sudan while work in pursuit of a political solution continues.Recognising the urgent need to sustain and strengthen the African Union AMIS force in advance of the establishment the UN/AU hybrid force, Ireland has committed €5 million to support its efforts to protect the vulnerable in Darfur. Three members of the Permanent Defence Forces also serve with the EU support mission for AMIS. In addition to our work on protection and security, the Government has been striving to meet the human needs of the victims of violent attacks and those who have been forced to flee their homes. Since 2006, Irish Aid has provided a total of over €25 million in humanitarian assistance to Sudan, through international organisations and through Irish and international NGOs.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	761	IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  Today the level of FDI in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  At present there are over 1,000 overseas companies with substantial international operations in Ireland, employing over 135,000 people.  The challenge for IDA Ireland is to sustain, embed and grow this investment.We have been successful as a country over the past decade but we continue to face new challenges in light of strong competition. We have to move to a more advanced level of investment, bearing in mind the higher costs and lower level of unemployment we now experience.  In responding to this challenge IDA Ireland is focusing on the development of its employment base into high technology, high value added and high skill functions, including not only high-end manufacturing, but also areas such as high-end services and R&D.The economic environment facing Ireland has changed in recent years.  Irish firms are facing growing competition both in Europe and globally.  We know that we cannot compete on the same basis as in the past.  We need to protect our current strengths and develop new bases for competitive advantage.  As knowledge and innovation become the basis for competition and economic development, important policy issues in the medium term will be developing our innovation potential, the human capital of our country and our economic and technological infrastructure.The National Development Plan 2007 to 2013, which was announced earlier this year, details an investment of €13.6billlion in Enterprise over the lifetime of the Plan.  The investment includes €7.7 billion for training and upskilling our people, €3.3 billion in Enterprise Development and €2.7 billion, as part of an overall investment of €8.3 billion, in Science, Technology and Innovation.Ireland has now established a reputation globally as a location for advanced manufacturing, sophisticated business services and, increasingly, for leading research and innovation.  Each of these areas will be of critical importance to our continuing success.I am satisfied that the policies and strategies being pursued by the Government under the National Development Plan together with the policies being pursued by IDA Ireland are the most appropriate ones to attract and grow foreign direct investment in the country that will, in turn, maintain and grow employment into the future.

Under the NSS, Longford/ Westmeath is part of the Midland region. Athlone and Mullingar are joint gateway towns together with Tullamore, while Longford is a hub town.I am satisfied that the strategies currentlyin place for the development of Longford/Westmeath under these plans are the most appropriate and will lead to productive and sustainable employment for the people of the region.

This, however, is dependent on a number of factors, including, for example, a positive outcome to discussions with stakeholders.  It is not possible, at this stage, to give an indication of the likely date for publication of the Bill.Company Law Consolidation and Reform BillI expect to seek Government approval in early autumn for the formal drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Council of the Company Law Consolidation and Reform Bill.  As the Office of the Parliamentary Council has indicated that its work on the Bill is expected to take up to 18 months, the date of publication of the Bill is likely to be late 2008 or early 2009.Employment Agency Regulation BillFollowing the recent period of consultation and subsequent clarification of certain legal questions, I expect to submit the Heads of the Bill to Government for approval in early autumn. Depending on the volume of Bills submitted for drafting to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the priorities identified by Government as to drafting, it is anticipated that the Bill will be published before end-year.Employment Law Compliance Bill 2007Preparatory work is well advanced to give effect to the commitment in "TOWARDS 2016" for publication of the Employment Law Compliance Bill in 2007. The Social Partners and other relevant interests will be consulted on detailed proposals for the Bill and Government approval for final drafting will be sought as soon as those consultations are completed, within the next few months.  The content and timing of publication of the Bill will be decided by the Government in due course.Transfer of Undertakings (Pensions) BillThe examination of this issue is to be concluded by the end of 2007.

While the pay terms are not binding in the formal sense, it is expected that implementation would be effected through local agreement.  Except where otherwise agreed at local level, the pay terms of "Towards 2016" came into force on the expiry of the pay terms of Part Two of "Sustaining Progress" in each individual employment or industry and last for a period of 27 months.It is open to an employee whose employer has refused to pay the terms of the social partnership agreements to refer the dispute to the Labour Relations Commission.  The dispute can only be investigated if the employer is willing to participate in such an investigation.

On 22 May, the company advised all employees that it was considering closing its facility in Athlone and entered into a period of consultation with employees and their representatives.In the meantime, discussions had been taking place between IDA Ireland and local management in Athlone and the management of the parent company in the United States.  These discussions centered on the possibilities of finding alternative products that could be moved to Athlone at short notice.  Efforts to find such products continued throughout May and June but were unsuccessful.Last Friday, the company advised its employees that it had no alternative but to cease operations in Athlone.  Some 32 staff will remain to the end of August to decommission the facility.  A further 12 staff members are being relocated to other facilities in Ireland and 65 staff members have already succeeded in finding alternative employment.  The balance, 54 people, have received one month's notice of redundancy.  The company is supporting its staff through active outplacement and the hosting of job fairs.Both the company and IDA Ireland will be actively involved in promoting the site and, indeed, there have already been visits to Athlone by potential new tenants.  However, at this stage, it is too early to say when a new employer might occupy the facility.  The Employment Services of the Industrial Training agency FÁS are working with the company to assist the workers to find employment, identify training needs and provide guidance and training where necessary.  In addition, the agency is co-operating with the Athlone Institute of Technology in the provision of appropriate services for the workers.

Under this section, it is an offence for a person to trade or carry on a business under a name or title of which "Limited" or "Teoranta" is the last word, unless duly incorporated with limited liability.Complaints relating to cases of this kind received by the Companies Registration Office are referred to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) for attention.  I am informed by the ODCE that it received 13, 26 and 43 complaints in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively in relation to alleged trading while unincorporated.  A minority of this category of complaint related to trading as a limited company while struck off the Companies Register.  ODCE does not track the aspect of trading pertaining to the person the subject of each such complaint.I understand that it is ODCE practice to determine these complaints on an administrative basis.  This means that the persons who are the subject of the complaints are either found not to be in breach of company law or where a breach is evident, that the persons in question take action to correct their non-compliance thereby obviating the need for possible legal proceedings.  Such remedial action typically includes restoring the company to the Register of Companies or ceasing to represent the trading entity as a limited company.  If the Deputy has information relating to particular companies trading while unincorporated I would encourage him to refer it to the ODCE for its consideration.

The range of benefits to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work and this is in turn reflected in the rate of contributions payable.  Self-employed individuals pay Class S contributions at a rate of 3% and are eligible for a narrower range of benefits than employees who, together with their employers, are liable for a total contribution of 14.05% under PRSI Class A.  Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may claim supplementary welfare allowance, which is subject to a means test.PRSI contributions comprise a social insurance portion and a health contribution.  The health contribution goes towards the funding of public health services and does not become part of the Social Insurance Fund which finances social insurance payments. Entitlement to health services in Ireland is not related to these contributions but is primarily based on residency and means.  If the Deputy has any further queries in relation to this case, he is invited to contact officials from my Department.

Processing of claims for Disability Allowance necessitates a medical examination of the claimant in some instances, and also investigation of the claimant's means by a Social Welfare Inspector, which may require a visit to the claimant's home.  These processes can add time to the overall claim adjudication process.There has been a continuous upward trend in recent years in the numbers of Disability Allowance claims — at the end of 2005 there were 79,253 recipients of DA, this had increased to 83,697 at the end of 2006, and at this point there are 85,905 people in receipt of the allowance.  The Department received 17,581 new applications in 2006, and to date in 2007 some 8,986 claims have been received.The average time to decide a claim is currently just under 17 weeks.  While some of this time can be attributed to the factors mentioned above, this timescale falls short of the Department's target processing time for this scheme, which aims for 70% of new claims to be decided within 9 weeks.  Every effort is being made to improve claim processing times, including use of overtime.  Additionally, a review of the resourcing requirements of the section is being undertaken to identify any further steps which may be necessary.

It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.The increase is not a payment in its own right but one that is paid as a supplement to an Irish social welfare payment. As such, it cannot be paid to people without a social welfare entitlement or to those whose pension payments are made exclusively under the social security regimes of other countries.In relation to the latter, the needs of older people are often provided for in different ways by other countries. While the Irish system provides a basic pension, supplemented by allowances, increases and other benefits, the approach adopted by other countries can be very different involving, for instance, a pension based on pre-retirement earnings.  It is of course open to recipients of pensions from other countries to apply for the state pension (non-contributory). In order to qualify for the state pension (non-contributory) a person must satisfy a means test. The pension, including, where appropriate, a living alone increase, can be paid in addition to other pension income. Changes in the income disregard for non-contributory pensions announced over the last two Budgets will help more people to qualify for a pension and improve the income of existing pensioners on reduced payments. At present some 11,000 British Retirement Pensioners are also receiving a state pension (non-contributory).

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	784	I propose to take Questions Nos. 405 and 406 together.Permanent and pensionable employees in the public service — other than those who were recruited after 6 April, 1995, registered doctors and dentists employed in the Civil Service, Gardaí, commissioned army officers and members of the Army Nursing Service — are liable to pay social insurance contributions at the modified PRSI Class D rate during their working lives. While these contributors are not eligible for social insurance-based pensions on retirement, they can accrue entitlement to the widow's/widower's (contributory) pension, the guardian's payment (contributory), occupational injuries benefits, the bereavement grant and carer's benefit. This reflects the reduced 0.90% PRSI rate that they paid as permanent and pensionable workers and the fact that their former employers cover them directly under Civil Service regulations for occupational pensions.Holders of occupational pensions are required, under statutory provisions set down by the Department of Health and Children, to pay a health contribution of 2.00% on all income exceeding €480 per week and for an additional contribution of 0.50% on all income exceeding €1,925 per week. The Department of Social and Family Affairs collects this contribution on behalf of the Department of Health and Children and nominally denotes the contribution as PRSI Class K.Health contributions are channelled into the funding of national health services by the Department of Health and Children and are consistent with the solidarity principle of the PRSI system. Entitlement to health services in Ireland is not related to these contributions but is primarily based on residency and means.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	785	The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefit package or free travel retain that entitlement. This measure is in place to ensure that households who have this entitlement do not lose it on the death of a spouse.People aged over 70 years of age can qualify for the household benefits package regardless of their income or household composition. Those aged under 70 must live alone or only with certain excepted people in order to qualify. Excepted people for the purposes of the scheme include qualified adults, dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full time education, people who are so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months, people who would qualify for the allowance in their own right, people who are providing constant care and attention to any member of the household who is so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months.A range of proposals has been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package of free schemes. These proposals are kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	786	I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 413 together.The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is an income support for employees on low earnings with families.  There are currently 20,780 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment with an average value of over €130.  Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer. My Department has publicised the scheme regularly in order to maximise uptake by qualified families. Following significant increases in the income limits in the 2006 budget, my Department undertook a week-long nationwide awareness campaign in March of that year to encourage increased take up of the scheme.  This campaign, combined with the improvements in the income limits, resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims.  During 2006 some 13,608 new claims were received.  This compared with 7,781 claims in 2005 — an increase of 75 %.Family Income Supplement is paid for 52 weeks provided a person continues to meet the qualifying conditions, and a claim for renewal may then be made. The upward trend in new claims is reflected in volumes of claims for renewals.  Renewals to 23rd June 2007 are 12,278 compared to 9,889 received in the same period in 2006. This represents an increase of 24%.  This has resulted in an increase in the number of claims on hand.To date in 2007, my Department has received 18,249 new and renewal FIS claims and has decided a total of 14,766 cases.  At 1st June 07 there were 8,068 claims awaiting decision. These were comprised of 3,526 new claims and 4,542 renewal claims.  The average time it takes to award a FIS claim or renewal in 2007 (up to end of May) is 10.16 weeks.My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  Measures have been introduced to directly address the timeliness of claim processing for FIS: A review of existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing; Priority is being given to cases where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment; Additional resources have been assigned specifically to improve delivery of service, and the ongoing staffing requirement is under review.These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.  The position is being kept under review by my Department.

A further 11 per cent of workers pay social insurance contributions at the Class S rate.  These contributions which are subject to various thresholds, allowances and ceilings, accrue entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions under various social insurance schemes. The current employee PRSI ceiling stands at €48,800 per annum.It is estimated that a decrease in the employee PRSI rate from 4% to 2% would reduce Social Insurance Fund income by some €720 million in a full year. The abolition of the PRSI ceiling for ordinary employees would yield some €295 million in additional contribution income. A decrease in the self-employed PRSI rate (Class S) from 3% to 2% is estimated to cost approximately €220 million in a full year.  Of course if introduced as a package, the combination of measures could give rise to a compound effect.Revisions to PRSI rates and the employee ceiling are considered annually in a budgetary context, with changes incorporated into the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, as required.

The first actuarial review was published in October, 2002 and reflected the position of the Social Insurance Fund at the end of 2000.The second actuarial review will update that report to address the position of the Fund at the end of 2005.  The focus of the examination is the income of the Fund (including the accumulated surplus), the contributory pensions and benefits paid from the Fund, including non-cash benefits (household benefits package) and other payments (redundancy and insolvency payments). The period to be covered by the review is 55 years (from 2006 to 2061).Following an evaluation process during the summer of 2006, external consultants were selected to carry out the actuarial review.  Work on the review has now been completed.  When the report has been considered by Government, it will then be laid before the houses of the Oireachtas. There is no date fixed for publication as yet but, legislation requires that a copy of the report be laid before the Oireachtas within six months of completion, publication.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	789	The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, puts forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.  The paper also proposes the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment.One of the proposals in the report is that the upper income limit for the new social assistance payment should be set at €400 per week.  This element of the proposal was achieved with the increase in the upper income limit for the one parent family payment to €400 per week with effect from May this year.The new social assistance payment, currently being developed by officials in my Department will have the long term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment — the avenue that offers the best route out of poverty.  Any proposed new payment can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place by other Departments and Agencies.  This is why the Government has instructed the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce a new payment scheme.Work on the development of this implementation plan is progressing.  Issues including access to childcare support, education, training and activation measures are being discussed with the relevant Departments and Agencies.  The development of legislation to introduce the new social assistance payment has been prioritised in my Department and work on this is at an advanced stage.To further inform the process, my Department, with the co-operation of FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Education and Science, will test the proposals in both an urban and rural setting.  These tests will focus on identifying and resolving the practical and administrative issues that may arise.  The tests will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant departments and agencies to be considered and developed and will facilitate the development of the new scheme. It is planned that these tests will roll out in the Autumn.

Since 1997, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant is that the person be providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care. In June 2006, the number of hours a person may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home and still be considered to be providing full time care and attention was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.I am pleased that one of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement Towards 2016 is the development of a National Carer's Strategy. This strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community, will be developed by the end of 2007. All relevant Departments and agencies will be involved and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners. Departments are currently in discussions regarding the best way to advance the process.In line with the Government's commitment to carers which is reflected in Towards 2016, I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review.

My Department, in cooperation with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Pensions Board has been working over a number of months on the preparation of the Green Paper and I hope to have it discussed by Government as soon as I have completed my consideration of the matter.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	792	The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) last year, provided services to some 12,500 new clients throughout the country. The number of active cases at the end of the year was some 14,900. The demand for the service can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit generally and to the quality of the service provided by MABS advisors.In 2006, €16.4 million was provided to fund the service and in 2007 the allocation was further increased to €17.67 million to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload. There are 53 independent companies nationwide employing some 230 money advice staff who deliver the service at a local level.I plan to bring proposals to establish the MABS on a statutory basis to the Government shortly. My intention in this regard is to build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public, combining a continuation of local voluntary involvement with strong national leadership to ensure a high quality consolidated MABS for the future.  I also want to take account of best practice in corporate governance for a customer focussed service that provides value for money for the taxpayers investment and meets the challenges posed by the rapidly changing face of debt in 21st century Ireland.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	793	Under the terms of an earlier Social Partnership agreement the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with qualified child increases and possibly including other child supports such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, resulting in a single second tier child income support.  Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.  This commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the current social partnership agreement Towards 2016.NESC has indicated that, as the proposed second tier income support would represent a new approach to targeting, the issues involved are complex and there are technical and policy challenges to be overcome.  The Council's analysis of these issues will, when received, be of assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.While jobs are the most effective way of lifting families and their children out of poverty and child benefit accounts for 68% of child income support payments, the substantial improvements in targeted measures announced in Budget 2007 for children in low income and welfare families will have an important impact on child poverty.Family income supplement income thresholds were raised in Budget 2007, increasing the weekly payments of almost all existing FIS recipients by €9 for a one child family, to €111 for a family with eight or more children.  Research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families and this improvement continues the re-focusing of thresholds towards larger families which started in Budget 2006, thereby further targeting resources at low-income households.In Budget 2007 all three qualified child increase rates which had remained unchanged since 1994, were increased to a single rate of €22 per week.  In addition, the annual back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which provides income support for the poorest families at a particularly difficult time of the year, was increased by €60 for children aged 2 to 11, and by €95 for children aged 12 to 22, bringing the rates of payment to €180 and €285 respectively.These changes represent a more selective approach to child income support through targeting children in poorer households while at the same time limiting the extent to which employment incentives are worsened.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	794	I propose to take Questions Nos. 417 and 424 together.It is a fundamental principle of our social insurance system that those qualifying for benefits must satisfy a range of contribution and other conditions. In the case of contributory pensions this involves commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate. The State pension (contributory) is a valuable benefit and the conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying have had a sufficient and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system.A special pension for the self-employed was introduced in 1999 to enable people who were over age 56 at the time of the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed in 1988, and who could not therefore meet the standard qualifying conditions, to receive a contributory pension.  To qualify, a person must have been age 56 or over on 6 April 1988, started paying social insurance contributions as a self-employed person on or after this date and have at least 260 full-rate social insurance contributions paid on a compulsory basis since first starting to pay social insurance contributions as a self-employed person. The personal rate and increases for a qualified adult and a qualified child are paid at 50% of the standard maximum rate.The arrangements introduced in 1999 are designed to give some recognition under the social welfare system to a group of people who would not otherwise qualify for any payment, contributory or means tested. I consider the arrangements to be a reasonable response to the situation that existed at the time and, accordingly, I have no plans to make any enhancements to this special pension. I might add that similar arrangements were introduced in 2000 to give some additional recognition to people with pre-1953 social insurance.The case reported on by the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) involves a couple who were over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance for the self-employed was introduced. Accordingly, they were unable to satisfy one of the requirements for a standard pension as they did not commence paying insurance 10 years before pension age. The couple also failed to qualify for a pension under the special arrangements introduced in 1999.While one of the couple could have qualified had they paid the necessary contributions, because of advanced age the other person would not have been able to contribute the necessary level of contributions before reaching pension age. A refund of part of the social insurance contributions was available to such people from 1996.Having considered the case, the IHRC has recommended that a reduced benefit should be paid to people who, because of advanced age, could not satisfy the conditions for the special pension introduced in 1999. The recommendations of the IHRC are based on its assessment of the situation under the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Code of Social Security.In relation to the European Code of Social Security, the IHRC places particular emphasis on provisions in relation to the position of people, who by reason of age when provisions are introduced, cannot satisfy contribution or employment conditions. The Department makes annual reports on compliance with this Code to the Council of Europe, summarising changes to the social welfare system. These reports are then referred to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Committee of Experts for their examination. The Department's 1999 report included details of the self-employed provisions which are now the subject of the IHRC investigation. At that time, the ILO Committee confirmed that Ireland met its obligations. Accordingly, as an initial step in its review of the IHRC report, my Department has asked the ILO Committee of Experts for its views on the way in which the IHRC has interpreted the relevant articles. The position will be reviewed in the light of the views received.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement at age 65. Because of the purpose for which the scheme was introduced, a key qualifying condition was that a person had to be retired in order to qualify for a payment. Retirement was defined as not engaging in insurable employment, which today means earning less than €38 per week. The social welfare pension age was subsequently reduced in stages until it reached 66 years of age, which means that the retirement condition is now only effective for 1 year.I consider it important that those who wish to continue in employment after normal retirement age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.  Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and it can also be beneficial to the individual.  There are additional costs involved in removing the retirement condition but I am keeping the position under review with a view to implementing the change when resources permit.The retirement condition associated with the state pension (transition) is only one aspect of a much broader agenda which will need to be addressed if we are to create the conditions where people can continue in employment past what we now regard as normal retirement age.  As the House is aware, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the social partnership agreement Towards 2016. The Green Paper will include an examination of all the issues surrounding retirement age, the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment and the incentives in this regard which can be considered. It will be published when the Government has completed its consideration of the issues raised in it. When the Green Paper has been published there will be a consultation process after which the Government will develop a framework for a long-term pension policy.

These rent limits are set at levels that enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.Setting maximum rent limits higher than justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.   The maximum rent limits, that rent supplement applicants can incur, are set out for each county in the tabular statement.Single Person SharingCouple SharingSingle PersonCouple No ChildCouple or One Parent 1 ChildCouple or One Parent 2 ChildrenCouple or One Parent 3  ChildrenDublin98981302001,000(PM)*1,200(PM)*1,200(PM)*Kildare9898120178953(PM)*1,200(PM)*1,200(PM)*Wicklow9898130190953(PM)*1,200(PM)*1,200(PM)*Cork7575115153175190203Galway7070115140175200200Meath7070115140175190200Louth7070115130160170200Wexford8080115130150170170Waterford8080115130150170170Tipperary Sth.8080115130150170170Carlow8080115130150170170Kilkenny8080115130150170170Mayo7070115115175200200Roscommon7070115115175200200Limerick7070110130150170185Kerry7575100153153190203Tipperary Nth.7070100130150170185Clare7070100130150170185Sligo7070100120150170170Longford7070100120140160175Westmeath7070100120140160175Offaly7070100120140160175Laois7070100120140160175Monaghan707090121140155191Cavan707090121140155191Donegal707090120140153170Leitrim707090120140153170* Per month.

A determination of the entitlement of the person concerned to payment is expected to be made at that time and she will be notified directly of the decision.  The Health Service Executive has further advised that the person concerned may also call the Southern Area HSE (Free-phone number 1800-742287) in early July to ascertain the status of her claim.

Consequently, an overpayment of €5,366.90 was raised on her claim and she was notified accordingly on 12 June 2007.  She should contact her Local Office so that account can be taken of all her circumstances when agreeing arrangements for recovery of the overpayment.It is also open to her to appeal the Deciding Officer's decision and a form for this purpose has been issued to her.Under Social Welfare Legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	799	The Community Employment (CE) scheme is a programme administered by FÁS which is designed to assist long-term unemployed and others who are distant from the labour force by offering them part-time and temporary work positions in jobs based within local communities. Following the placement, participants are actively encouraged to capitalise on the skills and experience that they have obtained through the scheme by seeking more permanent part-time and full-time opportunities within the mainstream workforce.  Participants on the CE scheme are provided with an average of 39 hours of paid employment per fortnight for a one-year period.Earnings from this work are liable to PRSI contributions at class A. Participants with reckonable weekly pay of €339 or less are insured at PRSI sub-class A8 and are exempt from paying a PRSI contribution, while participants with earnings exceeding that amount are insured under PRSI sub-class A9 which has an employee social insurance liability of 4 per cent of earnings after the first €127. In each case, the employer pays a reduced PRSI contribution of 0.50%.The requirement to pay PRSI Class A contributions was introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1996. This extension effectively placed these workers on an equal footing with PRSI Class A workers — both in terms of social insurance liabilities and benefits.  Income from CE schemes is assessed as earnings for the purposes of any Social Welfare means tested payments. The implications this has for an individual will depend on the scheme in question as schemes have different income disregards/income limits.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  The CE scheme is included, among others, as one of the qualifying payments for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme.Participants in a CE scheme are assessed under the standard rules for BSCFA and must satisfy the standard means test in order to qualify for payment.  The Health Service Executive has advised that it disallowed an application by the person concerned in 2006 as her household income was above the prescribed limit for entitlement to the allowance.  The person concerned  was advised  by the Executive of the decision and she was also informed of her right to appeal. The HSE has further advised that to date they have no record of an application for BSCFA from the person concerned for this year.The weekly income limit appropriate to a single person with one child when the application was made was in 2006 was €314.90. The limit in 2007 is €331.30.

On 1 December 2006 he returned his Christmas bonus and weekly payment to his local office as he was unhappy with how his name appeared on the receipt from the Post Office.Staff in the local office explained the problem to him and wrote to him on 6 December 2006 confirming that the receipt from An Post had been corrected and that the returned payment had re-issued. This was again confirmed to him in writing on 12 December 2006.  However, no payment was collected at the post office since 5 December 2006 and the claim lapsed automatically on 2 January 2007.The staff in the local office have made ongoing efforts to honour his wishes as far as it is possible to do so. He has been invited on many occasions since then to make a new claim but has refused to do so.  It is therefore proposed to regard the current inquiry as an application for jobseeker's allowance and process it from a current date.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 who are permanently resident in the State, whose late spouse held a free travel pass and resided with them on a permanent basis are eligible for the free travel scheme if they are now in receipt of certain social welfare payments including widow/er's contributory or non-contributory pension.Where a person is in receipt of a particular payment from my Department but would also satisfy the qualifying conditions for another payment, it is possible for that person to switch to the other payment and indeed I would advise people to do so if the other payment would be more beneficial to them.  In the case of a person wishing to switch to invalidity pension, he or she would need to satisfy not just the medical conditions but also the social insurance contribution conditions.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	802	In order to qualify for child benefit, applicants must satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC).  The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were being imposed by many of the other Member States.   The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.EU regulations provide that EEA nationals who have been employed since coming to this country, are entitled to payment of family benefits under the same conditions as Irish nationals and the habitual residence condition does not apply in their case.  Since the introduction of the HRC in May 2004 to May 2007, the total number of child benefit claims refused was 1,780, involving approximately 2,500 children. Refusals mainly apply to people whose claims for asylum have not yet been finalised, or who do not have a work permit or who have a minimal attachment to the workforce in Ireland.Asylum seekers are provided with direct provision accommodation.  In certain cases they may also avail of exceptional needs payments from the local Health Board for the period that their asylum application is being processed.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	804	The social welfare system is based on income replacement with entitlement related to defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age and widowhood. Social welfare legislation provides that, with some exceptions, only one social welfare payment is payable at the one time. This approach is common to most social security systems across the world and is intended to ensure that resources are applied to the best advantage in meeting the income needs of people who experience the contingencies covered.There are three main principles which underlie the operation of the PRSI system. As already indicated, generally, only one income support payment may be paid at the same time. Secondly, the contributory principle requires that those qualifying for benefits demonstrate an ongoing and adequate attachment to the social insurance system. Finally, there is the principle of solidarity whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits at the individual level, but can be redistributed to support other contributors.In general, qualification for social insurance benefits is based on a person's own contribution record. The widow/er's contributory pension is unique in this regard in that either a personal record or that of a late spouse can be used to qualify. This, combined with a contribution condition which can be satisfied with as little as 3 years contributions, was designed to make qualification for pension achievable and, given the nature of the contingency in question, relatively easy for the majority of widowed people. It was not the intention that these qualifying conditions should be used to allow for the payment of more than one pension.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	805	Social welfare pension schemes have always featured a standard qualifying age for men and women, currently 65 or 66 years of age depending on the scheme.  The position in relation to private and occupational schemes is different in that the normal retirement age for each scheme depends on the rules of the individual scheme. Historically, many such schemes provided for different retirement ages for men and women, often 65 and 60 respectively. However, following an EU judgement in 1990 (generally known as the Barber case) schemes had to change their rules to ensure compliance with the principle of equal treatment , as provided for in Part VII of the Pensions Act, 1990.Part VII of the Pensions Act, prohibits employers from treating persons differently in relation to the normal retirement age for members of a scheme. Where there is inequality, any discriminatory rule is null and void , and must be addressed by providing the more favourable treatment to all affected members until such time as the scheme rules are changed to comply with the principle of equal treatment.I am not aware of any demand for changes in the way equal treatment principles are applied in relation to retirement ages. Different treatment for men and women in this regard would be contrary to the Pensions Act and, indeed, equality legislation generally.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	806	The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment ( such as Jobseekers Allowance or family income supplement ) , of a Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  Separately, the Department of Education and Science operate a book grant scheme for primary and secondary schools.From June 2006, an allowance of €120 was payable in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years, or €190 in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years.  As announced in Budget 2007, the rate of payment of BSCFA is being increased by €60 per child for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €95 for children aged 12 to 22. In each case, this is a 50% increase.  The new rates (applicable for 2007) are €180 for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €285 for children aged 12 to 22.  This increase will provide a considerable boost to families at a time of considerable expense in the year.  The annual expenditure on the scheme will increase to €38.1m as a result of this measure. The number of children that will benefit in 2007 is expected to be slightly higher that those benefiting in 2006 as the income limit is increased for 2007.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents and I am satisfied that the improvements to the scheme for this year and next year provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.  The adequacy of back to school clothing and footwear allowance payments will be kept under review.  Any further changes to the scheme such as a reduced rate for the people whose income is above the relevant limit, would have to be considered in the context of future Budgets and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.

Apart from these two Funds, the Health Service Executive, FÁS and Dublin City Council also provide finances for the running costs and staffing of the centre.  It is currently nearing completion and I understand that it is expected to open in the autumn.Under the YPFSF, the centre received capital funding of €963,000 towards the development of the centre and an initial annual allocation of €316,000 for the employment of a number of staff (including a centre manager, a senior youth worker and two youth workers) and a contribution towards the running costs associated with the Fund's target group (i.e. 10 to 21 year olds who are at risk of drug misuse).In addition, further funding of just under €100,000 p.a. was recently approved under the Fund which brings the overall annual allocation to approximately €415,000 (€80,000 for running costs with the remainder covering staff costs).  My Department has also provided a further €65,000 through Ballyfermot Local Drugs Task Force under the Emerging Needs Fund for the employment of a dedicated Youth Outreach Worker to work with at risk/recreational drug using young people.  I am confident, therefore, that the substantial capital and current funding allocated by my Department will enable the project to cater well for the target group of the YPFSF.

The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula (which was included based on the serious difficulties caused there by Food and Mouth disease).The areas covered by CLÁR were reviewed in 2003 and, again, in 2006.  The total number of counties now covered is 23 with a population of nearly 727,000.  At the time of the CLÁR extensions, the Electoral Division of Breaghwy (ID number 29072) was not selected for inclusion in the Programme as it did not fit the criteria.  The population of Breaghwy increased from 904 in 1926 to 1361 in 2002, which resulted in an increase of 50.55% in the number of persons living in this electoral division.  Accordingly, the school referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for CLÁR funding.  I have no plans at present for any further expansion of the areas covered by CLÁR.

In discussions with the Commission on the RDP they requested that nationally funded measures, such as this Scheme, be removed from the Programme. My department therefore prepared an application for State Aid approval separately, as required under EU rules. This is currently under consideration by the Commission. My Department is in contract with the Commission with a view to advancing this consideration as rapidly as possible.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	821	I am fully committed to reducing unnecessary bureaucracy in the administration of the Common Agriculture Policy and one of my main priorities is to pursue simplification of procedures at farm level. The adoption by Ireland of full decoupling under the Single Payment Scheme, thereby replacing six EU subsidy schemes each with complex application, qualification and implementation procedures, demonstrates in a very tangible manner the extent of my commitment. I have also, on a continuous basis, applied the benefits of IT, wherever possible, in the interests of quality customer service.I fully support the EU Commission's ongoing efforts to reduce the regulatory burden of administration on producers, food processors and national administrations and I am contributing actively to this process. I have raised this issue on numerous occasions with the Commissioner and, indeed, with the Presidency which has given the highest priority to the process of simplification and the reduction of the bureaucratic burden of the CAP. Among my main concerns is the lack of advance notification of inspections under the Single Payment Scheme and the level of sanctions to be applied under cross-compliance, including the extent of tolerance applied where non-compliance is inadvertent or negligible. I have made these points on a number of occasions in the Council of Ministers and urged the Commissioner to present proposals to improve the current situation as quickly as possible. I have also raised these matters with a number of EU Ministerial colleagues in order to garner support for my position.In this connection, I very much welcome the report on cross-compliance presented by Commissioner Fischer Boel to the Council of Ministers and the conclusions agreed at the Council on 11/12 June. I particularly welcome the Commission's proposals to introduce tolerances for minor infringements, to fix a threshold below which financial penalties will not be applied, to use the results of existing controls to rationalise the system of inspections, to amend the 10-month rule and to examine ways of improving the practicability and coherence of the rules on control rates and advance notice of inspections.I will continue to pursue these issues actively with the Commission and other Member States.

The findings of the inspection of 12 September 2006 was that the applicant had submitted over-claims in respect of five parcels. The total area claimed of 75.64 hectares was subsequently reduced to the found area of 73.60 hectares. Under EU Regulations, if the total number of eligible hectares found on an inspection is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held a penalty is applied as set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme. In this case, as the difference between the area claimed and area found was greater than two hectares, a penalty of double the difference was applied, as provided for under the regulations governing the Scheme, and the number of hectares eligible for payment was reduced to 69.52 hectares.These findings were notified to the person named on 10 October 2006. He was also notified of his right to seek a review of this decision. A request for a review was received on 5 March 2007.

This could have been a breach of the Scheme requirements.

In the year 2000 they decided to apply to have one brother's name removed from the herd number. This was done in 2001. The reference years for the Single Payment Scheme were 2000 to 2002. Some Single Payment entitlements were in the joint names of the two brothers and the remainder was in the name of the person named. Arrangements are now being made to transfer the remaining entitlements to the person named and my Department will be in contact with him shortly about any outstanding payments.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	832	The position is that the Single Payment Scheme is applicable to farmers who farmed during the three -year reference period 2000 — 2002, who drew down livestock or Arable Aid premia in at least one of those years and who continued to farm in 2005. The Single Payment Scheme entitlements established for individual farmers therefore is a true reflection of their farming activity and premia draw-down during the reference period. Special provisions were made for farmers (including young farmers) who entered farming for the first time in either 2001 or 2002. Their Single Payment was determined based on the average of the years 2001 and 2002 or on the basis of premia paid in 2002 as appropriate.The EU regulations also provided for the setting up of a National Reserve. The Reserve was created by reducing each farmer's individual Single Payment by an amount of up to 1.82%. The purpose of the National Reserve is to try and minimise the impact on farmers who, for a variety of reasons, may find themselves disadvantaged in the transition to the new decoupled support regime as a result of changes in their businesses during or since the reference period. In particular the intention was to provide enhanced or new entitlements for certain farmers who made investments in production capacity or purchased or leased land on a long-term basis or who converted from dairying to a sector for which a direct payment would have been payable during the reference period. Such farmers, at the time when they took these decisions, had a legitimate expectation that the coupled regime of direct payments would continue into the future.There were mandatory and non-mandatory categories in the 2005 National Reserve. In Ireland's case the mandatory categories were categories A, B(i) B(ii) B(iii) B(iv) and C. The non-mandatory categories were category D (new entrants) and certain hill sheep farmers who were prevented from increasing production during the reference period pending the publication of commonage framework plans. Separate application arrangements were in place for this latter group.In allocating entitlements to successful applicants in the mandatory categories the Member State must apply objective criteria and ensure equal treatment between farmers. In allocating entitlements to successful applicants in the non-mandatory categories the Member State must ensure that the allocation does not have the effect of increasing the value of any existing entitlements above the regional average value of entitlements. Similarly, the value of any new entitlements allocated to non-mandatory categories must not exceed the regional average. The Member State was allowed to determine what constituted the regional average.I established a Single Payment Advisory Committee comprising representatives of the farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department to consider the objective criteria that should be used in making allocations from the reserve to the mandatory categories and also the most appropriate way to determine the regional average value of entitlements in the case of the non-mandatory categories. The regional average value of entitlements was the average value of entitlements in the District Electoral Division (DED) associated with the applicant's herd number. This was considered to be a reasonable interpretation reflecting, as it did, the average value of payment entitlements and therefore the average farming activity and premia payments in the DED concerned during the reference period.The total amount of money available for distribution under Ireland's 2005 National Reserve was some €22.7m. Some €20m was allocated under the 2005 National Reserve with the balance brought forward to the 2006 National Reserve and subsequent years' reserve. The Single Payment Advisory Committee also makes recommendations on the categories of farmers who should benefit from the National Reserve in 2006 and 2007. There was only one mandatory category in the 2006 National Reserve (category A) and one non-mandatory (category B). The 2007 National Reserve catered for one mandatory category (A) and 3 non mandatory categories (B, C and D).The National Reserve is a scarce resource created by reducing the entitlements of existing farmers and will only be replenished by the relinquishing of any entitlements that remain unused. My Department must therefore be prudent is determining how the funds in the reserve are administered.

The person named applied in September 2005 to transfer entitlements by way of Private Contract Clause (Sale) under the provisions of Article 17 of EU Commission Regulation 795/2004. He subsequently applied to trade entitlements under Article 46 of EU Council Regulation 1782/2003.  The case was complicated by the fact that the person named did not get his own herd number until July 2005 and he did not declare any lands under the 2005 Single Payment scheme.My Department has now reviewed the case and has decided that the appropriate mechanism to transfer the entitlements is by way of the Private contract clause. This has now been done. Since the person named did not declare any lands under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme, he cannot be paid for that year. Payment under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme will issue to him shortly.

This animal was slaughtered on 23 February 2007. The first reactor retest for this herd was completed on 26 April 2007 and did not disclose any reactors. The second reactor retest is due to take place on 26 June 2007. If this second retest is clear, this herd will be de-restricted.

The proposal, which has my full support, was introduced to address EU citizens' concerns regarding the adverse treatment of companion animals slaughtered to obtain fur. It aims to create a harmonized approach in the EU on prohibiting all production, marketing and imports and exports of cat and dog fur. Once it is formally adopted, legislative measures will be introduced in Ireland to give effect to the ban on the production of and trade in such products.

Almost all capital expenditure in my Department relates to capital grant schemes involving relatively small scale investments by farmers and others in the agri-food sector. There were no capital projects costing in excess of €30m, and therefore requiring detailed cost/benefit analysis, undertaken by my Department in the period referred to.

The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and school and is available to parents to provide support and advice.  Officials in my Department have brought this case to the attention of the SENO concerned who, I understand, had not previously been contacted or advised of any difficulty in securing placement.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the child in question is in receipt of 20 hours per week home tuition to facilitate early educational intervention.

Work on the census for the current school-year (2006/07) is nearing completion.  The information is stored in a database and tables detailing class size information for each county are routinely issued by my Department.  Information is not routinely extracted and provided on a school-by-school basis as to do so would require a disproportionate amount of administrative time and make it impossible for staff to complete essential work.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	850	Spending by my Department on Higher level education has increased dramatically in recent years.  An amount of €783 million has been allocated to the university sector for 2007.  This represents an increase of €111m since 2005.  The funding being provided in 2007 marks a continuation of the significant upward trend in recurrent funding for the sector.The overall provision by my Department for the Higher Level sector amounts to some €1.9 billion for 2007.  This represents more than a doubling of the funding made available since 1997.  In 1997, the amount of funding provided to the Higher level sector was approximately €850 million.  The funding being provided in 2007 represents an increase of over €1 billion or 124% on the 1997 provision.Support for reform and development at third level and the creation of world class excellence at fourth level are now central Government priorities.  The new National Development Plan 2007-2013, recognises the critical role of higher education in the national innovation system that will be the basis of Ireland's economic and social development.  The Plan identifies the full funding of the sector — over €13 billion through the period — as a key strategic investment under the Plan.Unprecedented investment is now being made in our higher education system in pursuit of the development of the knowledge base on which Ireland's growth strategy, and the economic and social benefits that will flow from that, depends.  Supporting our higher education institutions is a major policy priority.  The targeted investments that this Government is now making in our higher education infrastructure, in promoting excellence through system wide collaboration and change, in widening access and in creating a vibrant fourth level sector are key long-term investments in Ireland's future.

In this context, the school concerned received a networking grant of €6,000 in 2004.  The school had its broadband connectivity installed in October, 2005 however, the school must confirm that it has an Acceptable Use Policy in place and it must indicate which content filtering option it requires prior to the activation of its connectivity via the Schools National Broadband Network.  My officials have advised that the school only returned its AUP in May 2007.I am aware of the benefits that good use of ICT can bring to our children's education and I am conscious of the need for further investment to ensure that we are realising the full potential of ICT to improve the learning experience for our young people.  To that end, I intend to publish a new ICT strategy in 2007 covering the period of the National Development Plan to 2013.  The National Development Plan contains a provision of €252m for ICT in schools, the essential purpose of which is to embed an e-Learning culture in teaching and learning in our schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	852	The criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools were revised in 2002 based on the recommendations of a report of the Commission on School Accommodation, on which the Education Partners were represented.  Applications for the recognition of new primary schools are assessed by an independent advisory board (the New Schools Advisory Committee) on the basis of the facts provided by the patron body in support of the case for the new school and the likely demand for places.  The report and the recommendations of the NSAC inform the Minister's decision on applications for recognition.A central element of this process is that patron bodies wishing to establish new schools must identify the level of demand for the provision of education under the ethos proposed and that potential enrolment will meet certain minimum targets.  Under this process all patron bodies are treated on an equal footing regardless of whether they are non-denominational, denominational, inter-denominational or multi-denominational.It has become evident that, in some rapidly developing areas, the traditional manner in which Patron's establish schools can no longer be assumed.  In recognition of this phenomenon, I announced earlier this year, the development of a new Patron model, with the VEC to act as Patron.  This suggested model has been broadly welcomed by the Education Partners.Work on the development of a new Patron model is on-going within the Department in consultation with the Education Partners.

The application has been assessed and the long-term projected staffing figure on which accommodation needs will be based has been determined and notified to the school authority.  The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works (OPW), which acts on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, has been requested to source a suitable site for this school.  My Department has been advised by the OPW that a suitable site has been identified and acquisition of same is currently under way.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	855	As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides a range of teaching and care supports for children of school-going age with special educational needs, including children with Down Syndrome.  The precise level of support is determined by the special educational needs of the particular child.Children with Down Syndrome are entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the educational psychological assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's circular.  In circumstances where a Down Syndrome child has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability category, this would automatically attract additional resource teaching support. Such applications are made to the local special educational needs organiser by the school.It is my understanding that the needs of the child referred to by the Deputy fall to be catered for from the general allocation system of learning support and resource teaching (LSRT) support.  The school in question has a general allocation of 1 LSRT post.  It is open to the school to identify the pupils with learning support and high-incidence special education needs that will receive this supplementary teaching support. The school can use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met.  My Department issued a guidance circular to schools which contained detailed information on how the new system operates.The general allocation system was implemented with effect from September 2005 and it is intended that it will be reviewed after three years of operation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	856	The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.Data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 422 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 15 mainstream class teachers.The enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 432 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 16 mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.  Hard copies of this circular have issued to primary schools.An appeal must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.  The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on the Department's website.The first meeting of the Appeal Board was held on the 22 May, 2007.  Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007.  The closing date for the receipt of an appeal for the July meeting was 22 June while the closing date for the October meeting is 12 October.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	857	Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.  The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department.  Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.  Otherwise, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	858	As the Deputy is aware, the Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating support teaching and special need assistants as a school-based resource for pupils in need of additional supports.I understand that the school principal has been in contact with the local SENO regarding the child referred to by the Deputy and the principal will apply for additional supports to the SENO.  A decision will be conveyed by the SENO to the school as soon as the application has been received and processed.

The NEWB has informed my Department that the young person in question is an 18 year old student who has just completed her studies at the school referred to by the Deputy.  The school has advised the NEWB that they have been actively seeking a training placement for the student through the National Learning Network.  The school has also advised the NEWB that a place will be offered to the student in a Training Centre.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	860	I take it that the Deputy is referring to the general allocation system of learning support/resource teacher (LSRT) support in primary schools.  The Deputy may be aware that the general allocation system was implemented with effect from September 2005.  The system is intended to cater for pupils with high incidence disabilities such as mild general learning disability and dyslexia and pupils with learning support needs.The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.  It reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments and puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels.  This allows for better planning in schools, greater flexibility in identifying and intervening earlier with regard to pupils' special needs, as well as making the posts more attractive to qualified teachers.Staffing levels under the general allocation model are allocated on the basis of the following categories of school.  For larger schools, differing pupil-teacher ratios apply to boys', mixed and girls' schools; schools for boys with 135 pupils or more get their first post at 135; second post at 295; third post at 475, fourth post at 655, and so on.  Mixed schools with 145 pupils or more get their first post at 145; second post at 315; third post at 495, fourth post at 675, and so on.  Schools for girls' with 195 pupils or more get their first post at 195; second post at 395; third post at 595; fourth post at 795, and so on.  All designated disadvantaged schools get their first post at 80; second post at 160; third post at 240; fourth post at 320, and so on.  It should be noted that schools qualify for a pro rata part of a post for pupil numbers below the enrolment point for the first post and between the first and second post, the second and third post, and so on.For small schools, in order to ensure that small schools are not disadvantaged by the introduction of the general allocation model, the point at which smaller schools can appoint their first post is significantly reduced.  For the purposes of the general allocation model, a boys' school is considered to be small if it has an enrolment of fewer than 135 pupils, a mixed school is considered to be small if it has an enrolment of fewer than 145 pupils, and a girls' school is considered to be small if it has an enrolment of fewer than 195 pupils.Small schools for boys will qualify for their first post at 100 pupils; small mixed schools will qualify for their first post at 105 pupils; and small schools for girls will qualify for their first post at 150 pupils.  However, no additional general allocation will be made to small schools for boys on the basis of an enrolment between 100 and 135, to small mixed schools on the basis of an enrolment between 105 and 145, or to small schools for girls for an enrolment between 150 and 195.For the purposes of this model, my Department categorises schools that had an enrolment of at least 30 percent boys in the 2003/2004 school year as a mixed school with the allocations in accordance with the ratios for mixed schools above, otherwise the ratios for girls' schools is used.  The ratio for schools designated as disadvantaged for the general allocation is 80:1 irrespective of the gender breakdown of the enrolment.Additional resource teaching support may be allocated to schools in respect of pupils with low-incidence special educational needs, such as autism.  Applications, supported by certain professional assessments and recommendations, are submitted by individual schools to their local special educational needs organisers, for consideration.  It is intended that the general allocation system of LSRT support will be reviewed after three years of operation.

My Department's preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department supports a multi-skills approach in regard to the education of children with autism where teachers may draw down from a range of autism specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).A third class for pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) was sanctioned by my Department in the school referred to by the Deputies in October 2006.  The sanction was subject to the school adopting a multi-skills approach to the provision of support for the pupils in all three ASD classes.  The report on a recent review of these classes by my Department's Inspectorate will form the basis for further discussion with the Board of Management of the school, the National Council Special Education (NCSE), the Special Education Support Service (SESS) and officials in my Department with the focus on ensuring provision of a child centred approach to the education of the pupils concerned.  A meeting with the school Board of Management is scheduled for the autumn.I acknowledge receipt of the associated correspondence referred to by the Deputy and a reply will issue in the coming days.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	868	The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.According to data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the girls' school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 307 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 11 mainstream class teachers.According to data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of boys' school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 278 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools,  the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 10 mainstream class teachers.I am pleased to inform you, that in addition to the above mainstream staffing approved on the basis of the staffing schedule, my Department has sanctioned a concessionary temporary post for each of the schools referred to by the Deputy for the 2007/2008 school year.

My Department had to be satisfied that the qualifications and structure of the pre-schools concerned were sufficiently robust to be able to provide early educational intervention to children with autism who has been approved for funding under the home tuition scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department has reached agreement with the provider in question.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	870	The closing date for receipt of applications under the Dormant Accounts / RAPID Leverage Fund Small Scale Capital Grants Scheme for schools was 1st March. The scheme covers the improvement of existing facilities (‘non new-builds') and the development of new facilities (‘new-builds') in four areas: (i) Outdoor Play Facilities; (ii) Libraries; (iii) Parent Rooms; and (iv) Dining Areas. Schools were asked to list their proposals under the four areas in terms of priorities from 1 to 4.The scheme was very heavily over-subscribed in terms of numbers of applications and the amount of funding sought by applicants. This has meant that the original time-frame for the assessment of applications has been somewhat delayed and there is insufficient funding to cover these applications. As a result, a phased approach to applications is being implemented which divides the assessment of proposals into ‘new-builds' and ‘non new-builds'; this approach was notified on 14th June to the schools which applied under the scheme.Phase 1 of this process involved an assessment of all ‘new-build' and ‘non new-build' applications for Outdoor Play Facilities which were identified by the schools as either Priority 1, 2 or 3 — lower priorities are not being assessed because there is insufficient funding available. Subject to Government approval being received shortly on the basis of these assessments, the Department should be in a position to advise schools about the success of their applications for Outdoor Play Facilities within the next two weeks.All proposals in respect of Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas involving ‘new-builds' will be considered for funding under the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme. The assessment and approval of the ‘non new-build' proposals for Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas is currently in progress and schools will be notified about their applications in due course.In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy, it should be noted that the school applied for the following under the scheme:Dining Room (New build): €175,000 — Priority 1 (plus Catering Equipment €5000)Library facilities (New Build): €175,000 — Priority 2Parent Room (New Build): €150,000 — Priority 3Outdoor Play Areas (New Build): €20,000 — Priority 4

The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.Data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 229 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.The enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 227 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website. Hard copies of this circular have issued to primary schools.The school referred to by the Deputy lodged an appeal with the Primary Staffing Appeal Board. This appeal was heard at the Appeal Board meeting on the 22 May, 2007 and was refused.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.  The Board of Management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the Appeal Board on 25th May, 2007.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operations of the Independent Appeal Board.

It operates in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk.  The Early Start programme is usually held in a Primary school setting.The running costs of Primary Schools are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs which would include utility charges such as heating and lighting and any other charges that the school incurs.  The Early Start programme attracts a capitation grant of € 95.23 per pupil per annum.Local Authority service and other charges payable to the various Local Authorities do not come within the remit of my Department. It is a matter for the Local Authorities to decide whether schools or pre-schools are liable to pay such charges. Where it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would be met from the capitation funding provided by my Department.

The Free Fees Initiative does not extend to postgraduate study in Ireland, however if a candidate qualifies for the means-tested maintenance grant he/she could have their fees paid up to the maximum fee limit. The maximum fee limit in respect of the 2006/2007 academic year was €5,730.Under the terms of my Department's Third Level Maintenance Grant Schemes, which are administered on behalf of my Department by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees, the position is that generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, age, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. An approved course for the purpose of the Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and full-time postgraduate course of not less than one years duration pursued in an approved institution.Under the terms of the Third Level Student Support Schemes, a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether a grant was paid previously. The schemes also provide that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second post graduate qualification. Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course which represents progression from the level at which the previous postgraduate qualification(s) was attained, may be deemed eligible for grant aid.Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level Colleges and Universities in the State and any other E.U.Member State. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the student's local Revenue Commissioners Office.

The application has been assessed in accordance with published prioritisation criteria for large scale building and was assigned a band 2 rating.The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, was requested to explore the possibility of acquiring a site for the school in question. Following an advertisement seeking proposals in relation to possible sites a number of responses were received. Six sites have been visited and their technical suitability as a location for the school was considered.Following this process, a site on the existing Tipperary Rural and Business Institute (TRBDI) campus emerged as the preferred option. This site is in the ownership of the Institute.  The TRBDI, however, has proposed to the Department that its campus be relocated to a large-scale technology park. Expressions of Interest were sought by TRBDI from the private sector to determine what exactly could be provided at the technology park in exchange for the Institute's current property in Clonmel. The Expressions of Interest sought required the incorporation of a suitable site for the school on the current campus or on an alternative site approved by the Department and the Office of Public Works. The Expressions of Interest received by TRBDI have been evaluated and detailed negotiations are being entered into with the company that has submitted the tender provisionally identified as being the most advantageous.While this process is reasonably well advanced, I appreciate that it is taking longer than expected. Given the urgency of the schools' needs as you have outlined them to me, the Department will immediately seek alternative site options in Clonmel, with a view to acquiring a site before the end of the year.Funding is available for the purchase of the site as part of the record provision of €4.5 billion for school buildings in the National Development Plan.  I absolutely appreciate how long the school has been in its current accommodation. I assure you that the Government will do all that we can to have a site for the school by the end of 2007 and that the project will then be progressed in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	894	I propose to take Questions Nos. 523 and 565 together.The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding.  My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools, including the school referred to by Deputy Shortall. With effect from January 2007, the standard per capita grant was increased by €18 per pupil and now amounts to €316 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €30 per pupil in 2007 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €189 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €48 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to over €500 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €290,000. This represents an increase of 83% since 2000.Budget allocations for schools in the VEC and C&C sectors are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.

A number of improvements have recently been made to school bus transport such as the phasing out of the ‘3 for 2' seating arrangements. All children travelling on school buses under the school transport scheme have been provided with individual seats.  Bus Éireann hired in over 300 additional private contractors' vehicles to address the capacity shortfall arising from the provision of ‘1 for 1' seating and the Company was given approval to acquire 161 extra school buses, including fifty new buses.In addition, all nominated school buses in the school transport scheme have been equipped with approved seat belts.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	899	All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS.NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06 means that children with high incidence special needs now longer have to wait for an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support. Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the local NEPS Regional Director, contact details for whom are also available on my Department's website.

The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.  As a completed survey form was not received from the school referred to by the Deputy it could not be assessed for participation in DEIS.  The issue of primary schools that did not complete survey forms in 2005 will be further considered by my Department in the context of the implementation of the action plan over the period 2007-10.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	904	It is unclear from the Deputy's question whether the student referred to is pursuing a second undergraduate course — with a graduate entry requirement — or whether the course in medicine is at postgraduate level.  In the case of this query relating to a second undergraduate course I wish to advise that under the prescribed terms and conditions of my Department's student maintenance grant schemes grant assistance may not generally be awarded in the respect of a repeat period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded.If the query relates to postgraduate study in the UK I wish to advice that in 1996/97, my Department's student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in other EU Member States.  The courses must be followed in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.  The extension of the schemes at that time did not extend to courses at postgraduate level.Any extension of the current arrangements, to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses in the U.K. generally would have to be considered within the context of all other E.U. Member States.  There are no plans at present to extend the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses outside of Ireland.  Such a proposal would have to be considered in light of existing resources and other competing demands in the education sector.However, Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by Section 29 of the Finance Act 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate tuition fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland.  This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000/01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax.  Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the candidate's local Tax Office.

Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the School Transport Scheme.Bus Éireann, which is responsible for the day to day operation of the school transport scheme, on behalf of my Department, has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, resides 0.64 kilometres from the pick up point.  The family should liaise with Bus Éireann regarding the availability of a payable extension to the current service.

Once the long term projection has been determined and agreed with the school authorities, a decision will be made on how best to address the school's accommodation needs.When this assessment is complete and the long-term projected staffing agreed with the school authorities, a site visit will be required in order to inform the final brief and my officials will be in contact with the school authority at the appropriate time to arrange this visit.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	907	The National Council for Special Education, through the local Special Educational Needs Organisers, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs supports from primary and post primary schools.Special Need Assistant (SNA) support is provided specifically to address the care needs of pupils with special educational needs. My officials have been in contact with the school regarding the case referred to by the Deputy. The child to whom the SNA has been assigned is leaving the school and there are no other children in need of SNA support in the school at this time. There is currently no basis, therefore, for the retention of the SNA post in the school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	908	The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.Data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 71 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers.According to data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 75 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on the Department's website. Hard copies of this circular have issued to primary schools.Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on the Department's website.The first meeting of the Appeal Board was held in May, 2007. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007. The closing date for receipt of an appeal for the July meeting was 22 June while the closing date for the October meeting is 12 October.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	911	Under the general funding arrangements for school building projects the amount of the local contribution for extensions/ refurbishments is 10% of the total project cost with the contribution being capped at €31,500.00.  The level of the local contribution for schools with disadvantaged status is 5 % of the project cost subject to a maximum amount of €12,500.00.  These arrangements are of a general application.The position in relation to the school referred to by the Deputy is under examination in my Department at present and the school management will be contacted in the matter as soon as possible.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	912	Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which s/he lives.The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their ‘own' post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way either to the catchment boundary or to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.Bus Éireann which operates the School Transport Scheme on behalf of my Department have advised that the current pick up point is the nearest suitable location within the Claremorris catchment area.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	913	An application for an extension and refurbishment project has been received from the school referred to by the Deputy.  This project was originally determined with a projected enrolment of 550 pupils and will have to be re-assessed in the light of decreases in enrolment trends in recent years.  This will comprise a reassessment of demographic trends, housing developments and enrolment trends in the area in order to ensure that any capital funding provided will deliver accommodation appropriate to the school's need into the future.  When the long-term projected enrolment has been finalised and agreed with the school authorities my Department will draw up schedules of accommodation for the project which will be notified to the school management authority. The project will then be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	914	An application for capital funding has been received from the school to which the Deputy refers. This application will be assessed with reference to factors such as current and projected enrolments at the school, the likely impact of ongoing and proposed housing developments and existing provision in the general area. When this assessment is complete, a decision will be taken on how best to provide for the current and emerging accommodation needs at the school. The proposed project will be considered in the context of the multi annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	915	The position is that the details of a funding package for the graduate medical entry programme are currently under consideration in my Department. While the overall funding package has not yet been fully agreed, I expect that this will be finalised shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	916	There were some 39 recommendations in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences, with costed proposals totalling an additional €244 million, of which €66.3 million would be a recurring annual cost. Of the 39 recommendations, 4 are not for the education sector. Of the remainder, progress has been made on implementing 25 of the recommendations and my Department continues to progress the recommendations as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FORFAS and industry.Significant progress has been made in a range of areas e.g.  A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of €1000 per school plus €10 per pupil.  A revised syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and it was examined for the first time in June 2006. Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced and examined within the last five years. Work on the revision of the two remaining Leaving Certificate subjects — Agricultural Science and Physics and Chemistry (combined) — is well advanced. The introduction of each of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme. In that context, €16 million was issued to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus.Investment in the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutes (PRTLI) is continuing apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development.While I have made it clear that I am not yet convinced of the need for lab assistants and that I believe that their provision would lead to demands for similar assistance in other subjects with a strong practical component, the Government is committed under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation to re-visit this issue.As the Deputy will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry. These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.Other aspects of the Plan include: reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age, strengthening teacher training in this area, reforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula, promotion of science initiatives in Transition Year; and the provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services.Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	917	The Department has a number of proactive strategies in place to ensure that the accommodation requirements for the schools in developing areas, such as Midleton and East Cork are addressed in a manner that will meet the long term education needs of the population.  The process for assessing the need for new or additional accommodation facilities at primary or post primary level in any given area entails consideration of relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and existing school capacity to meet current and future demand.As part of this process, the Department is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or variations to development plans. In addition, the Department meets with the relevant local authorities to ascertain the extentof development foreseen and the implications for school planning. This process helps to make informed decisions in relation to long term accommodation needs of the schools in the area and in particular for those schools that have submitted applications for major capital investment in their buildings.

As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs who do not attend special classes, and for establishing additional special classes where a need has been established.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	934	In order to meet the language needs of students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled. I indicated in January last that the limit of two teachers per school and the limit of two years' support to an individual pupil which had applied up to then, will no longer apply. As a result, an individual school may be allocated up to six language support posts under the arrangements now in place.Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers. Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over €6,300, while schools with between 10 and 13 such pupils receive over €9,500.Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years. There are now approximately 1,450 language support teachers in our schools. This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001/02 school year.The estimated total cost of providing these supports for the past 3 years is as follows:2004 — €24,326m2005 — €32,256m2006 — €48,427mIn line with the Government's commitments under the ‘Towards 2016' partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT). The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way. The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	935	The 1998 Education Act requires Boards of Management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able.  The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan.  It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.In general, schools at both primary and second level attempt to use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.In recent years, new syllabi and curricula have been devised for second-level schools.  These have been designed in such a way that the differing needs of a wide range of pupil ability can be catered for by teachers.  The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.While content is outlined in the curricula at both levels, process is also heavily emphasised.  Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated.  The development of language skills, investigatory and problem solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually and as a member of a group are all encouraged at both levels.  While the use of information and communication technologies and the use of class and school libraries are of benefit in project work with all pupils, they have a special importance for pupils who are exceptionally able.In addition, my Department provides annual funding to the Centre for Talented Youth at Dublin City University to support its work in delivering programmes, which are designed specifically for exceptionally able children of first and second level age.  This year's grant is €95,000.  Of particular significance at second level are the International Olympiads in the science subjects, in information technology and in mathematics, in which the exceptionally able and highest achieving pupils compete.As the Deputy may be aware, the new Programme for Government contains a commitment to further improve services for gifted children.

While I have not set a specific deadline for the completion of his work, I do expect to receive Dr Port's advice shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	938	Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants.  These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges.The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €163.58 with effect from 1st January, 2007.  This represents an increase of over 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.Enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €418 to €805 per pupil.  These were increased by an average of 30% recently.The capitation grant is in addition to the Ancillary Services Grant which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.  The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from €102 per pupil in 2002 to the current rate of €145.50 per pupil.Under the new Programme for Government, we are committed to doubling the standard capitation grant for primary schools over the next five years.  Grants to schools for the employment of secretaries and caretakers will also be increased significantly.Appropriate classroom equipment is provided as part of extension/refurbishment projects and new school buildings funded by my Department.  Under the furniture and equipment element of my Departments School Building and Modernisation Programme funding is available for the provision of additional equipment at developing schools or the replacement of outdated/damaged equipment.A special PE funding package, of €6.5 million, issued late last year to all 3,200 primary schools. Under the package, every school received €2,000 towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment in their school.  This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.  The modern equipment which can be purchased will help facilitate PE and sporting activities in schools, which everyone recognises is a very important aspect of school life.  This funding package was made as part of this Government's continued commitment to modernise facilities in schools throughout the country.In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to all primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.I increased the level of grant payable under the annual devolved grant scheme for minor works to national schools last November.  All primary schools with full recognition receive a basic grant of €5,500 plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil and €74 per special needs pupil.  This grant is intended to address works required to the physical infrastructure of the schools or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use, including IT related equipment.  Around €27m was paid out to primary schools throughout the country to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.Primary schools that establish a class for special needs pupils receive a once-off grant of €6,500 per class to purchase equipment, including physical education equipment, that they feel best meets the needs of the pupils attending the class.  I would also point out that schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including Physical Education.

Implementation of the modernisation agenda, requires in the first instance, that the parties to the agreement agree an Action Plan in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.  The Action Plan sets out the timetable and actions required for implementation of the modernisation agenda and was agreed by all unions in the Institute of Technology sector other than the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI) in early December 2006.  As the TUI failed to agree the action plan until 8th March 2007 they did not satisfy the terms of the agreement until that date.  In addition this failure prevented progress on a specific commitment agreed under Towards 2016 to review and revise arrangements for the scheduling of apprenticeship blocks by January 2007.In the circumstances the decision of the Secretary General was that payment of the increase due w.e.f. 1st December 2006 was warranted to members of the TUI from the 8th March 2007 only, i.e. the date that co-operation with the terms of the Agreement was restored.  This decision was subsequently endorsed by the Education Sector Performance Verification Group.The TUI have referred the matter to the dispute resolution mechanisms available under the Towards 2016 Agreement.

Therefore, the student is advised in the first instance to contact the disability or access offices in the third level institutions they are applying to for advice on how to further progress their application to study in higher education.The Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) advise that in general performance in a single sitting of the leaving certificate is the standard measurement of academic ability and many applicants with a disability attain the minimum criteria for admission on this basis.  AHEAD also advise that when an applicant indicates through the CAO that they have a disability, the supplementary admissions process by each higher education institution will include consideration of the accommodations that are required, including any accommodations for the purpose of admissions.  This process will include consideration of the impact of a disability on the prior education of an applicant and whether the minimum standards for admission have been met on the basis of one or more sittings of the leaving certificate or a leaving certificate in conjunction with another post-second level qualification.

In this regard and, as the Deputy will be aware, I have already given the go-ahead for the delivery of a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school in Phibblestown.  This new school will be delivered along with new schools in Donabate and Laytown under a design and build contract and the Department is working with the relevant parties on the delivery of these projects within the earliest possible timeframe.The Department has also reserved a site for post primary provision in the Tyrrelstown area of Dublin 15.  The educational reservation in the Hansfield SDZ also allows for the development of a post primary school for up to 1,000 pupils. A project manager has recently been appointed to oversee the development of educational provision on the Hansfield site.  With regard to Castleknock specifically, the Department is examining site possibilities for a new post primary school with the local authority.

Pensions have been increased on foot of the various general and Benchmarking pay increases awarded to serving personnel under the Sustaining Progress Social Partnership Agreement 2003 — 2006, up to and including the final general round increase of 2.5% effective from 1 June 2006.The Public Service Pay Agreement that forms part of the new Social Partnership Agreement Towards 2016 provides for phased general pay increases of 3% from 1 December 2006; 2% from 1 June 2007; 2.5% from 1 March 2008; and 2.5% from 1 September 2008.  Payment is dependent in each sector on, among other things, satisfactory implementation of the sectoral agenda for modernisation.  I understand that, within the established negotiation machinery, the pay and related terms of Towards 2016 were offered to PDFORRA, and that this matter was the subject of detailed discussions with that Association.  I also understand that the terms of the Agreement — including a modernisation agenda for the Defence Forces — have recently been accepted following a ballot of the membership of PDFORRA.The Performance Verification Group have confirmed that modernisation targets have been met and have recommended payment of the increases. The Secretary General of the Department has accepted that recommendation and the administrative arrangements for payment of the pay increases from 1 December 2006 and 1 June 2007 are now being put in place for serving personnel. This would pave the way for corresponding increases in military pensions from the dates mentioned.

The Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004 prohibit discrimination in the access to and provision of goods and services on nine grounds, which include age. The Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2007 outlaw discrimination on the same grounds, but in the area of employment.The provisions with regard to age were strengthened in the Equality Act, 2004 which gave effect to the EU Anti-Discrimination Employment Directive. No upper age threshold is provided for, although compulsory retirement ages may continue to be set. Prior to introduction of the 2004 Act, an Advisory Committee on Implementing Equality for Older People, chaired by the Equality Authority, prepared a report entitled Implementing Equality for Older People containing a series of recommendations for action on promoting equality for older people and challenging ageism.The Equality Authority is the independent body set up under the equality legislation to promote equality of opportunity and to work towards the elimination of discrimination in relation to employment and the provision of goods and services. The Authority has undertaken a series of initiatives to combat the problem of ageism across all age groups.The Equality Authority, the National Council on Ageing and Older People and the Health Service Executive have organised the annual Say No to Ageism Week, launched on 18 June. The Say No to Ageism Campaign is an annual campaign to tackle attitudes to ageism against older people. Early public awareness campaigns emphasised negative labelling and the limitations placed on people as they age. This year’s campaign highlights attitudes to ageism and uses outdoor advertising, national and local radio and a ‘beermat’ campaign to create opportunities for people to express their views and to discuss attitudes to ageism. The campaign is backed by a series of initiatives at local and regional level involving the Health Service Executive and partners in the transport sector including the Rural Transport Programme, Veolia (Luas), Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Bus. Specific training, consultative and educational initiatives have been undertaken in exemplar sites throughout the health services and in the employment, marketing and customer service areas of the transport sector to improve services and accessibility for older people. Reports of these initiatives were published during this year’s campaign.The Equality Authority is conscious of the particular issues faced by young people in relation to ageism. The Equality Authority, in cooperation with the National Youth Council of Ireland, commissioned a report published in 2006 entitled Inequality and the Stereotyping of Youth People, which found that a majority of young people considered their institutional relationships with adults to be rooted in stereotypical attitudes. The report outlined a number of recommendations relating to status, resources, access to decision-making and relationships between key institutions and youth people. The Equality Authority and the National Youth Council of Ireland have held meetings with statutory and non-governmental organisations to identify effective strategies to implement these recommendations. The Equality Authority is also currently finalising a Youth Stereotyping Resource Pack for youth leaders and youth groups to support action by them to challenge ageism.The Equality Authority has published research reports relevant to age discrimination, as follows:Helen Russell and Tony Fahey (2004) ‘ Ageing and Labour Market Participation’, andAnne Basten, Greg Irwin and Donna Heaney (2002) ‘ Labour Market Inequalities for Older People in Ireland: Listening to the Views of Older Persons’ (web publication only).

This initiative involves the removal of graffiti from sites within the pilot areas of  Dublin City, Galway City and Bray, Co. Wicklow. The clean up operation, which commenced in August 2006, was allocated a budget of €3 million for 2007. To date, over 2,200 sites have been identified and allocated to contractors for cleaning.The pilot project is overseen by a steering group comprised of representatives from the three Departments, and an independent evaluation of the programme was commissioned in order to determine the programme's effectiveness. The evaluation report was received recently and is being examined.

The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled,  the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength (all ranks) of Ballymahon Garda Station as at 31 May 2007 was 4.It is the responsibility of the Garda Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Ballymahon Garda Station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.

When persons are found using such vehicles in breach of legislation appropriate action, as circumstances dictate, is taken.I am also informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda patrols target areas and public parks where the activities described by the Deputy are likely to be committed, to detect and deter offenders from such activity.  Community Gardaí and Garda Mountain Bike Units are utilised to great effect in targeting this type of activity.  Gardaí liaise with park wardens and other local authority personnel to address these issues and where appropriate recommend preventative measures.  In certain areas specific initiatives have been put in place to target this activity.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 provides a power for a member of An Garda Síochána to detain vehicles used in a public place where the driver is too young to hold a driving licence, the vehicle is not insured or the vehicle has not been taxed for three months or more.  These powers are fully utilised by the Garda authorities.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.

Mullingar is in a group of nine locations for which a tender process is now underway.  Depending on the conclusion of the tender process it is anticipated that installation of the system will be substantially completed this year.An important development with regard to the Garda CCTV systems is the decision to outsource the implementation of the systems as well as their ongoing support.  Therefore, issues such as planning matters are now the responsibility of the supplier while overall project control remains with An Garda Síochána.  This approach will contribute to the speedier implementation of the Garda CCTV systems.  Another significant aspect is the decision by An Garda Síochána to implement, where possible, wireless technology.  This will limit the need for costly and time-consuming excavation works when CCTV systems are being installed.

The Commission, established in March 2005 with a three year remit, was given two main functions:to distribute funding for organisations that give support to victims of crime, andto develop a framework for services to victims of crime.I understand that the Commission has been in ongoing contact with the Chairperson of MISS over the past few months and that support has been offered for the operation of the helpline.  I am further informed that the Chairperson of the Commission together with another member of the Commission met with representatives of MISS on Wednesday 20 June 2007 to further consider their application for funding to establish a missing persons helpline and to provide such ongoing supports as are necessary to operate such a helpline.  It should be borne in mind that the Commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not.I should point out that the Commission is entirely independent in the performance of its functions and it would not be appropriate for me to comment or intervene in any way with a decision taken by the Commission in relation to the allocation of funding.

The position is unchanged.The second person concerned arrived in the State on 8 August, 2000 and applied for asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 31 October, 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.

The Property Registration Authority replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.In order to be of assistance I forwarded the Deputy's query to the Authority for its attention and direct reply.  I understand that a reply has already issued.

I am aware that a notice outlining changed conditions was, due to an error of communication, recently posted in the offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau and I appreciate that this gave rise to some confusion regarding the renewal of such permissions.  That notice has since been removed.My Department is however conducting a review of the qualifying conditions that apply to such renewals.  Matters under review include the level of funds that a student must have in order to show that they can support themselves financially while in the State and the means whereby it can be verified that these funds are genuinely at the student's disposal (i.e. not merely transferred for a short period so as to satisfy the immigration authorities).  The Deputy may be aware that there have been a number of abuses in this sector in the past.  Any significant changes arising from this review will be notified well in advance.

The position remains the same.  The application was received in the Visa Office, Cairo.  The decision of the Visa Officer to refuse the application was taken on September 5th, 2006.  The Visa Officer who examined the application was not satisfied, on the basis of the documentation submitted, that the applicant would adhere to the conditions of the visa.An appeal against the refusal decision was received in November, 2006.  Following a re-examination of the application, the decision to refuse was upheld in January, 2007 as the applicant had not adequately addressed the reason for refusal.  As each applicant is entitled to one appeal only, no further review in this matter can be granted; however it is open to the applicant to make a fresh application.

The average processing time for such applications is approximately 30 months and this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.The table shows the total number of applications received in the years 2000 to date.  These figures illustrate a significant upward trend in the number of applications received.  With over 3,000 applications received to date in 2007, this upward trend looks set to continue for the foreseeable future.YearApplications for naturalisation received20001,00420011,43120023,57420033,58020044,07420054,52320067,0302007
(as at 22 June 2007)3,157The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form below.  Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,500 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant's financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Inquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time inquiries are also made with the Garda Síochána to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases  which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.The above procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.  However, I share the Deputy's concerns that the existing waiting time of 30 months is excessive and, accordingly, I have instructed my officials to undertake a review of the various processes in order that these might be streamlined further where possible.

This is provided for in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  Under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, it is an offence for a person to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into Ireland of another person whom that person knows or has reasonable cause to believe is an illegal immigrant.  The penalty on conviction on indictment for this offence is a maximum of ten years imprisonment or an unlimited fine or both.Legislation creating an offence of recruiting, transporting, transferring to another person, harbouring or knowingly arranging or facilitating the entry into, travel within or departure from the State of a person for the specific purpose of the trafficked person's sexual or labour exploitation or removal of his or her organs is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It provides a penalty on conviction on indictment for the offence of a maximum of life imprisonment for the trafficking of a child under 18 years of age and a maximum of 14 years imprisonment for trafficking an adult.The penalties provided for in the existing and proposed legislation are severe and show, I believe, our abhorrence to the crime of trafficking in persons.  At present, victims of trafficking are dealt with on an administrative basis having regard to the particular circumstances of each case.  It is recognised that victims of trafficking, who are often highly traumatised by their experiences, require care and protection.  The relevant authorities are mindful of this fact when dealing with the victims of trafficking and approach such cases in a sympathetic and pragmatic manner.In addition, it is intended that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007 will, upon enactment, provide a framework to deal with immigration related matters arising from the relevant protection provisions in the Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in persons.  In particular, in the context of the treatment of victims, the Bill will allow for arrangements to be put in place whereby a victim of trafficking will be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State and also, in circumstances where he or she wishes to participate in any criminal proceedings in the matter, a further period of residence in the State to enable him or her to do so.On enactment of these pieces of legislation, which I am treating as an urgent priority within my Department, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the international instruments on trafficking in persons.

This Directorate will have a total staff allocation of 37.The Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar is now fully operational with a staffing complement of 162 civilians.  Additional civilian staff are currently being recruited to bring the staff complement up to 190.An Garda Síochána will be recruiting an additional 40 staff to the Garda Central Vetting Unit in Thurles, bringing the total staff number, all grades, up to 75 staff.The appointment of Senior and Higher Crime and Policing Analysts will take place on 1 August 2007, as the first step in the development of the new Crime Analysis Service.31 new civilian posts in the Garda Telecommunications area are currently being filled.Sanction has been granted for an additional 76 civilian middle management clerical and administrative posts to be located around the country on a Regional and Divisional basis.  Recruitment for these posts is currently underway.The Commissioner is in the process of recruiting a new civilian Chief Administrative Officer at a grade equivalent to Deputy Commissioner, and a civilian Director of Communications is also being recruited.The Commissioner will also be recruiting civilian Directors in areas such as Human Resources, Information Communications Technology, Change Management and Head of Legal Affairs.Approval has been received for the appointment of a new Head of Procurement for An Garda Síochána and a Multi-Media Technician to work in the Garda Press and Public Relations Office.An Garda Síochána is committed to achieving the greatest level of civilianisation consistent with the effective and efficient functioning of An Garda Síochána and will continue to work to drive the civilianisation programme forward.

The High Court delivered its judgment recently in the case of Niall Dillon -v- The DPP.  That case concerned the constitutionality of section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847.  The Court held that the provision is unconstitutional.  The Court's written judgement is still awaited.  It will be examined when it becomes available, with a view to determining the appropriate response.The Deputy will be aware that the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Vagrancy and related offences (LRC11-1985) examined provisions relating to the offence of begging.  The recommendations of the Commission included proposals for the repeal of the entire Vagrancy Act 1847, Section 2 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act 1904 and certain parts of Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824.  The Commission recommended that new legislative provisions should be introduced, making it an offence to beg (i) in a public place, or (ii) from house to house in a manner likely to cause fear or annoyance.The Commission also recommended that the maximum penalty for this offence be a fine of £100 and/or one month imprisonment.  The Commission's other recommendations pertained to provisions related to causing or procuring a child to beg (this aspect was addressed in the Children Act 2001) and an offence relating to those collecting for charities under the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962 who obstruct a passerby in a manner likely to cause fear or annoyance.The Commission's recommendations will be among the matters to be considered once the judgment in the Dillon case becomes available.

An application for Family Reunification was made by the spouse of the person in question for the two children in March 2003.  A second application for Family Reunification for the two children was made by the person referred to by the Deputy in July 2004.These applications were forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.  The investigation was completed and the Commissioner has forwarded reports to my Department.  Following consideration of the reports, these applications were refused on 7 November 2006 and the applicants were notified accordingly.  The children's passports were forwarded to the Garda National Immigration Bureau for investigation as outlined in the refusal letters.

I wish to re-iterate that the case of the person concerned falls under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003).  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 13 October 2005, obliging her to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, (GNIB), in order for arrangements to be made for her transfer to the Netherlands where she had previously made an asylum application.  The GNIB attempted to effect her transfer on 28 October 2005, but the person evaded.The person concerned continues to evade her transfer and is illegally present in the State.  I would therefore urge the person concerned to come forward and present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without further delay in order to allow her transfer to the Netherlands to be effected.

They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).

I understand that a reply has already issued.  I would also like to refer the Deputy to a service for TDs and Senators concerning the current status of applications of this type which was introduced in May 2006.  The service was introduced, inter alia, to provide a speedier and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.

I understand that the person concerned has permission to remain in the State until 19 March 2008 with an unlimited work permit.Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years (ie: 60 months) on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension.  In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years (ie: 60 months) may also apply for long-term residency.  This particular long-term permission does not exempt the person from employment permit requirements.In considering such applications the following documents are required:1.Clear and legible copy of passport (all pages). In the event that the passport has been renewed since commencing employment, a copy of the previous passport must be provided.2.Copy of Certificate of Registration.3.Copies of work permits/working visa endorsements/work authorisation endorsements.Due to the large number of applications, I understand that applications received in June 2006 are currently being dealt with.  While applications for long-term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.

Three of the applications were refused because the applicants' relative in Ireland was earning less than the Family Income Supplement limit.  The fourth was refused because the Visa Officer considered that the applicant had not shown a sufficient obligation to return home.  Further, the Visa Officer was not satisfied that the applicant would adhere to the conditions of a visa if granted.It is open to all of the applicants to appeal the decision taken in their case.  Any such appeal should be submitted within two months of the initial decision.

The decision of the Visa Officer to refuse this application was taken on 6th June, 2007.  The application was refused because the Visa Officer was not satisfied with the financial evidence provided. The Officer was also of the opinion that the granting of the visa could result in a cost to public funds and public resources. The information supplied with the application contained inconsistencies. And finally there was no work permit supplied with the application.It is open to the applicant to appeal this decision; however, to date, no appeal has been received.

I can, however, inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board, which comes under the aegis of my Department, may cover the cost of DNA tests to determine paternity in certain circumstances and provided that the person seeking this assistance is in receipt of legal aid. i.e. s/he has applied for and been granted a legal aid certificate authorising proceedings in relation to children.Any such application may be made by either party to the issue of paternity and all such applications are considered in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 and the Regulations made thereunder.  I understand that the Board has its own guidelines in relation to the circumstances in which it will approve the costs of DNA tests and the extent to which it will bear those costs.  These guidelines are designed to ensure consistency in decisions in legally aided cases and, in common with all of the Board's guidelines on legal services, reflect the Board's commitment to providing a professional legal aid service to those who rely on the Board for such services.

Local Garda management is aware of complaints of anti-social behaviour in the area concerned and have directed that additional patrols by uniform and plain clothes Gardaí, including the local Community Policing Unit, be deployed in the area, with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible presence in the area.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of public order offences, the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents.  This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol and drugs.  There are currently 22 committees established as part of a pilot project, including in the Dublin City Council area, with a further seven currently being established.  In addition, because of the extent of the Dublin City Council area, five subcommittees, corresponding to the five operational areas of the City Council, have been established.

It is also the case that a number of Garda national units have been established in recent years, for example, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations (GBFI), other specialist units and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB). These units provide specialised policing services on a nationwide basis and augment the policing services provided at divisional level.The number of Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed by Garda Management. Such monitoring is aimed at ensuring that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. The next allocation of Probationer Gardaí is due to take place in September 2007. The needs of the Carlow/Kildare and Clare Divisions will be considered in this context by the Garda Commissioner.

These units provide specialised policing services on a nationwide basis and augment the policing services provided at divisional level.

The Regulations, which covered the rights of EU citizens and their non-EEA family members moving to Ireland, were subsequently amended on 18 December 2006 to take account of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union on 1 January 2007.  The Regulations transposed into Irish law the European Directive on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.     The Directive replaced a number of previous EU instruments in relation to free movement of persons.Regulation 3(2) is the relevant part of the Regulations referred to by the Deputy and it was informed by certain rulings from the European Court of Justice which dealt with the free movement of persons within the European Union.  A number of non-EEA spouses have been informed that they do not come within the Regulations as they did not reside in another Member State prior to moving to Ireland.  Some non-EEA spouses have been denied residence where they were already in the State without permission or were the subject of deportation or transfer orders.A recent High Court court case has affirmed the vires of the Regulations.  However there are a number of other court proceedings underway in relation to this general area and the Deputy will appreciate for that reason that I am not in a position to comment further on the legal issues involved at this point.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1070	The situation under current immigration legislation is that a non-EEA person under the age of 16 years is not required to obtain permission to remain in the State or register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau. In general, persons under the age of 16 years are, for the purpose of their immigration status, dependent on the status of their parent or other guardian.The current practice when registering non-EEA children of migrant workers on reaching the age of 16 is to grant them student permission to remain. Such permission is granted on the basis that the person concerned is, in general, pursuing a course of studies at second level. Time spent in the State under student conditions is not reckonable for the purpose of further immigration applications.   In circumstances where the child subsequently wishes to enter employment they must obtain the necessary employment permit. If an employment permit is issued the person can then reside in the State under employment conditions and accumulate legal residence in the State for the purpose of further immigration applications.I can inform the Deputy that it is my intention, in the context of progressing the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007, to review current policy in relation to the reckoning of time spent in the State for immigration purposes.   As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill provides for a significant overhaul of immigration legislation and includes provision to the effect that all non-EEA nationals, including those under 16 years of age, who wish to be present and reside in the State will be issued with a residence permit.

One of the priorities set for An Garda Síochána under section 20 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 is addressing anti-social behaviour and behaviour adversely affecting the quality of life of communities, with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour.  To this end An Garda Síochána are driving forward the establishment of interagency activities against anti-social behaviour, including the deployment of CCTV in urban areas.  In addition, they are identifying local public order and anti-social behaviour hot spots and developing responsive actions and plans.  The measures outlined in the Programme for Government to tackle anti-social behaviour will be introduced.I can inform the Deputy that strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, because of concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, provisions were brought forward to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme provides an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity and includes a restorative justice aspect.  It operates on a nationwide basis under the supervision and direction of the Garda National Juvenile Office.  The Programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age, who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident, may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution.  In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, who are responsible for administering the Programme at the local level.   It has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  The Children Act, 2001, which became law in May 2002, gives a statutory basis to the Programme.In addition to the Juvenile Diversion Programme, there are 84 Garda Youth Diversion Projects throughout the country.  Garda Youth Diversion Projects are a crime prevention initiative which adopt a multi-agency partnership approach to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level.  Proposals for new Garda Youth Diversion Projects are currently under consideration by my Department in conjunction with An Garda Síochána.  It is intended to establish a further 16 projects before the end of 2007, bringing the total number of projects to 100 nationwide.  I expect to make an announcement shortly regarding the locations of the new projects.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee (JPC) in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol and drugs.  There are currently 22 committees established as part of a pilot project, with a further seven being established.  It is intended to establish JPCs in all local authority areas by early 2008.  I am convinced that the work of these committees will make a significant contribution to reducing anti-social behaviour.The Programme for Government provides for an increase in Garda numbers to 15,000 by 2010 and 16,000 by 2012.  I am determined that the additional Gardaí being recruited under the current historic expansion of the Force will be deployed to frontline, visible and effective policing duties.

Since then some €29.9 million has been spent in the context of procuring land at Thornton Hall in Co. Dublin. In April 2007, a preferred bidder for the work involved in realising this project was selected and negotiations between this party and officials of my Department are at an advanced stage.There is an urgent need to replace the facilities at Mountjoy. Conditions there have been severely criticised by the Council of Europe's European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Inspector of Prisons. Its facilities are out-dated and incapable of meeting the challenges of administering a modern, progressive and safe prison system. This is particularly so in the context of the Government's stated aim to make prisons drug free environments. Redeveloping the existing 20 acre site at Mountjoy is not viable from an operational or developmental perspective. The construction of the new facility on a green field site will address the problems associated with the Mountjoy site and will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education, and medical services as well as providing single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation.The Programme for Government provides for investment in rehabilitation services, the development of individualised programmes for prisoners based on risk assessment and rehabilitation needs and incentives for prisoners to participate in such programmes. Fundamental to the achievement of this objective is an ability to categorise prisoners effectively. Thornton will provide the necessary facilities to achieve this.  In the circumstances I do not see any purpose in reviewing the Government's decision at this time.

In 2006, the City Council, in conjunction with a steering group, commissioned a wide-ranging study of Dublin Bay, including the Port area, with the aim of identifying and agreeing with key stakeholders a guiding framework for its future overall development.The Dublin Regional Authority also intends to establish a Dublin Bay Association with a view to producing a Masterplan for Dublin Bay, including the Port area.  As an initial step in the process, the Dublin Regional Authority organised last year a series of discussion fora for consideration of the various issues involved and invited formal submissions from interested parties.

The deadline for completed applications was 29 March 2007, and 186 applications for over €7m in total were received.  Having regard to the available funding of €1.6m, grant offers were made in respect of 86 of these applications. All applicants have been notified of the outcome in respect of their project.  It is intended that this scheme will be an annual scheme so it will be open to the project to submit an application next year.This Department also funds a scheme of grants for the conservation of protected buildings, which is administered by the local authorities. It is a matter for each individual local authority to assess and prioritise applications and approve funding. The scheme is aimed at assisting owners and occupiers to carry out conservation works on structures of architectural significance in the Record of Protected Structures which the Local Authority has listed under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Enquiries about this scheme should be made directly to the relevant local authority.

The Fund is intended to incentivise, stimulate and reward joined-up strategies and action in the Gateways by helping to fund targeted strategic capital projects that can trigger the accelerated development of the Gateways and their wider regions.The call for proposals outlines the main criteria on which applications will be assessed.  These include: Demonstration of how the proposal will aid the delivery of the Gateway vision and enhance its development on a sustainable basis; Active participation and collaboration of each of the local authorities within the Gateway area and effective integration of the proposals within wider Gateway development and co-ordination structures; Appropriate coherence and synergy between GIF proposals, other public sector funding measures and the leveraging of significant private sector investment in the Gateway and its wider region; Strategic fit with stated national, regional and local plans, strategies and other guidance documents relevant to gateway development; Compliance with the Department of Finance's Capital Appraisal Guidelines and VFM requirements; and detailed information on delivery and project management arrangements.The closing date for submission of bid proposals is 15 November 2007, with the intention of allocating funding to successful proposals in early 2008.  Each lead Gateway local authority is invited to submit their formal proposal, on behalf of all authorities in the Gateway.  It is of course a matter for the Gateway authorities to put forward those proposals which it feels best meets the Fund's objectives and criteria.

On 18 January 2007, the 2007 grant allocations for non-national roads were announced. The 2007 allocation of €16,148,885 to Westmeath County Council represents an increase of 55% on its comparable 2006 grant allocation.  Westmeath County Council wrote to my Department on 21 May, 2007 seeking funding for the replacement of the Green Bridge, Mullingar and this request is currently being examined.

My Department requested additional information from Mayo County Council in March in relation to the Preliminary Report for the Ballyheane, Cross, Crossboyne and Neale element of the scheme. A separate Preliminary Report has been submitted for Charlestown.In the meantime, the Council has submitted separate proposals to service Crossboyne under a Serviced Land Initiative scheme whereby wastewater from Crossboyne would be treated in Claremorris.   Additional information was requested from the Council last month in relation to this latest proposal.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.  My Department will shortly be contacting registration authorities with regard to the preparation by them of the Register for 2008-09. Authorities will be encouraged to build on the extensive work undertaken in preparing the current Register.  In particular, they will be advised to make maximum use of information gathered since the publication of the current Register, including information from Returning Officers, members of the public and others in relation to the operation of the Register at the recent General Election.It is also important that members of the public play their part by contacting their registration authority as required and checking the Register to ensure that their details are properly recorded.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1086	All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, which includes ensuring that all out offices, yards and forecourts within the curtilage of the building and all boundary walls, fences and railings are maintained in good repair.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.In September 2006 the Minister of State for Housing and Urban Renewal announced a comprehensive Action Programme to promote improvement in standards of private rented accommodation.  An important element of the Programme will be the updating of the existing standards regulations in consultation with relevant interests.  Submissions received in that regard are being considered.A further key objective of the Action Programme is to achieve more effective enforcement of the standards regulations.  Local authorities have been asked to prioritise action to improve enforcement through a planned and strategic approach.  Increased funding is being provided to them for this purpose and future funding will be related to the level of enforcement performance by housing authorities. The Centre for Housing Research is undertaking a study of measures to promote improvement in private rented accommodation standards, including good practice guidelines to assist local authorities in their functions relating to the private rented sector. I understand that this work is well advanced.Regarding tenant behaviour, under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 landlords are required to enforce tenant obligations, which include a requirement not to engage in or permit anti-social behaviour. The Act provides that, in certain circumstances, third parties adversely affected by a landlord's failure to enforce the obligations of a tenant under a tenancy can make a complaint to the PRTB.  The PRTB provides extensive information about its functions and services on its internet site, www.PRTB.ie, including some guidance for landlords in following up complaints of anti-social behaviour by their tenants.Insofar as noise may be an issue, section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 empowers local authorities to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise.  In addition section 108 provides that, in certain circumstances, a person may take court proceedings in relation to noise.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1089	I propose to take Questions Nos. 743 and 744 together.The Programme for Government includes measures to broaden out our approach to managing residual waste, with an increased emphasis on other technologies, including methods for mechanically and biologically treating waste.  The Programme rules out adjusting the landfill levy in such a way as to give a competitive advantage to incineration, and also commits to ensuring that for any future projects neither the State nor local authorities will be exposed to financial risk through put or pay clauses in contracts for waste facilities.The Programme does not include a legislative prohibition, as such, on incineration; nor would this appear to be consistent with EU legislation.  The Programme for Government also includes commitments to carry out an international review of the regional waste management plans, for which local authorities currently have statutory responsibility on the basis determined by the Oireachtas, and more generally in regard to local government reform.  In this context, consideration will arise as to what further changes may be necessary to ensure that Ireland has the appropriate legal and other mechanisms to properly determine an approach to waste management which is line with best international practice.

The placement of applicants on housing waiting lists is a matter for the housing authority concerned in accordance with its scheme of letting priorities.  Such applicants are also advised as to the housing services provided by voluntary groups in the housing sector, including the Safe Home Programme.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1091	The Design/Build/Operate model of Public Private Partnership (PPP) is employed under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme in accordance with the Partnership Agreement — Towards 2016.  The current Investment Programme covers the years 2005 to 2007 and contains 899 schemes.  Of the schemes currently under construction, 16 have a PPP contract.A fundamental principle of water services PPPs is that, while the infrastructure is operated under contract to the local authority, it remains at all times in the authority's ownership.  The Water Services Act 2007 underlines that position by expressly prohibiting the transfer of any water services assets or infrastructure, or any part of such assets or infrastructure, to any person.The PPP approach is employed in the water services sector only where it is clearly established that it provides best value for money overall.  Local authorities are required to examine all potential procurement options in an even-handed manner before recommending an appropriate procurement option.  The most appropriate procurement option is approved under the Water Services Investment Programme and the same level of Exchequer funding is provided by my Department, irrespective of the procurement route selected.  The overriding consideration is that all projects must deliver value for money and to this end, the Public Sector Benchmark and Post Project Review processes are important measures in ensuring value for money.The importance of the Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) is that it enables a comparison to be made on a like for like basis between traditional and PPP procurement.  The PSB is an important tool to determine whether a PPP approach will deliver better value for money compared to traditional procurement.  A PPP proposal must deliver value for money and must prove that it can do so before the route is chosen.In a water services PPP, the infrastructure is owned by the local authority and operated and maintained by a service provider under contract to the local authority.  Such contracts include a penalty clause for under-performance.  The local authority is responsible for monitoring and managing the service provider's performance and, as such, the operational element, like the capital infrastructure, remains under the supervision and control of the local authority.

These special arrangements operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Clare, Galway, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.  The service was provided free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites.  A significant finding from the pilot scheme was that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, further collections of waste silage/bale wrap were approved in September last for Carlow, Leitrim, Longford, North Tipperary, Roscommon and Wicklow County Councils and these concluded in January of this year.Following a review of the outcome of the second round of collections, it was announced that collections of waste silage/bale wrap were to be put in place in the remaining 18 county council areas on a phased basis.  This arrangement allows local authorities and local farming organisations sufficient notice to agree and put in place the necessary arrangements for collections in their areas.  Collections have now taken place in Donegal, Cork (West), Cavan, Sligo, Kilkenny, South Tipperary, and Meath.The next phase of collections will take place in counties Kerry, Limerick, Cork (East), Westmeath, Monaghan, Wexford and Laois.  The local authorities in these counties have now been asked to put in place the necessary arrangements for the operation of farm plastics collections in their functional areas.  Operational details, including the dates and locations of collections, are a matter for each local authority in consultation with local farming organisations.

Following on from the results of this survey my Department issued policy guidance in July 2006 in the form of circular letter PD 5/06.  In that circular letter it was made clear to planning authorities that they should not require the establishment of a management company for a traditional housing estate other than in very specific instances, e.g. to maintain a facility which is for residents' sole use.The policy guidance did acknowledge, however, that the question of who should be responsible for the maintenance of certain shared facilities in the newer type of mixed estate needed further examination.  Accordingly my Department established a Working Group, representative of local authorities, architects, planners and consumer interests to consider this issue and other related issues around taking in charge of estates.  The Group has now completed its work and has produced suggested draft policy guidance for consideration.I will carefully consider the draft policy guidance in the context of the new Programme for Government commitments in this area, in order to determine the most effective course of action.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1097	Under the Housing Management Initiative, direct control has been given to local authorities from 1 January 2007 over their internal capital receipts from the sale of local authority dwellings, to be used primarily for their improvement works programmes. While the Department approves the overall programmes it is the responsibility of local authorities to prioritise and advance individual projects.   The overall programme proposed by Dublin City Council was approved by my Department on 24 April, 2007 and a meeting is scheduled with the Council for 27 June to discuss the progress on the programme.Prior to the introduction of the new delegated arrangements, proposals on individual projects were submitted to the Department.  In this context, Dublin City Council sought approval on 27 September, 2006 for precinct improvement works to the development in question.  The Department replied on 13 November seeking clarification on a number of issues.  A follow up letter of 20 November sought the Council's views on the implications for the proposal of legal proceedings regarding the sale of flats that had been the subject of media coverage.Subsequently, Dublin City Council wrote to the Department on 6 December 2006 indicating that since the carrying out of improvement works would involve detenanting and temporary re-location of tenants, and as the authority was currently preparing a sales scheme for the flats, they were not prepared to consider carrying out extensive internal improvements.The advancement of this project is a matter for Dublin City Council in light of its consideration of these issues.

The range of work involves action by a number of Government Departments and agencies.  An inter-departmental committee, convened by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is considering legislative responses to issues generally relating to property management companies.  My Department is represented on this committee and will make every possible contribution to its work.The Government have already decided that property managing agents will be regulated by the Property Services Regulatory Authority under legislation currently being prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Property managing agents are commercial firms engaged by management companies to provide management and maintenance services for which management charges are paid.Residential property management companies, consisting of owners of dwellings, are generally constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to operate in compliance with company law.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is bringing forward legislative proposals to update company law generally.  Appropriate changes to company law provisions relevant to management companies would fall to be provided for in that context.A range of legal issues relating to multi-unit developments is being examined by the Law Reform Commission, which published a consultation paper on the matter last December.  The final report of the Law Reform Commission, which it is hoped will be published later this year, will help to inform decisions on the appropriate legislative responses to the various issues arising in relation to management companies.

The Directive is being implemented in Ireland in relation to the non-domestic sector on the basis of recovery of all non-domestic water services costs from non-domestic users of the services through water charges.This is being achieved by means of a meter based volumetric charge to ensure water charging of users according to actual consumption.  Metering should also encourage water conservation.  Waiver provisions in relation to local government services are generally targeted at relieving personal hardship rather than reducing changes to a broad sector such as non-commercial bodies.

This Paper will examine a number of issues in relation to the organisation of Irish local government including the establishment of new town councils and the powers of town councils.  In the context of preparing the Green Paper, I will give consideration to those parts of the Local Government Act, 2001 which have not yet been commenced.

A number of issues have been raised with my Department concerning the operation of this requirement in certain circumstances and these are currently under consideration.  Amending legislation would be required in the event of it being decided to introduce any changes to this requirement.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1104	The local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by authorities on or after 1 July 1986.  One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.The scheme is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Committee, which is a sub-committee of the County and City Managers' Association (CCMA) and is representative of the CCMA, the Housing Finance Agency and a representative of my Department.  While I am satisfied that the terms and conditions of the existing scheme are satisfactory, I will keep the arrangements under review in consultation with the Mortgage Protection Committee.

The last review of local electoral areas was carried out in 1998.  The June 2004 local elections took place on the basis of the existing local electoral areas.  The next local elections are due to take place in 2009.  I will be considering the review of the local electoral areas in the light of the final results from Census 2006 and other relevant factors.

The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 specify that objections on scientific grounds to designation of lands as SAC may be made by persons with a legal interest in the land within three months from the date of notification.The objector in question lodged an objection, which was examined by relevant officials of my Department.  Their assessment was that, on scientific grounds, the land in question is of sufficient importance to be retained within the SAC.  The objector has been informed accordingly and has chosen to have the matter referred to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board who will make a recommendation to me, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, for the final decision on whether to include or exclude land from the designated area.  It would be normal practice for the Appeals Advisory Board to visit the site in question.

While it was not possible to include this proposal in the 2007 fire services capital programme, funding has been provided for a range of priority projects which have been advanced in County Waterford in recent years.  These include replacement stations and extensions or upgrading works at stations in Ardmore, Cappoquin, Dungarvan, Dunmore East and Tramore.The provision of a station in the wider west Waterford area will be considered under future programmes having regard to the existing facilities, the level of activity, the proximity of other fire stations, the fire authority's priorities and competing demands for the available funding.  My Department has written to the fire authority requesting an appraisal in relation to fire cover in the wider west Waterford area, given the proximity of Lismore, Tallow and Cappoquin fire stations, and an outline of its priorities for replacement stations in the county.

This scheme consisted of a programme of conservation and adaptation works to the ground floor, the provision of access to the first floor and the provision of an exhibition and reception point.  This has facilitated visitor access and provided a guide service.  The site is now open to the public on a seasonal basis.I am advised that further facilities, including the provision of toilets, would be required if there was to be greater use of the Castle.  It is not feasible to provide these at the site in the current circumstances.  However, if opportunities were to arise to overcome this problem through the acquisition of land, my Department would examine these in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.

My Department will maintain appropriate contact with the Department of Finance in this regard.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1111	There is no provision at present in the voluntary housing schemes for the purchase of individual houses by tenants.  However, it was agreed under Housing Policy Framework — Building Sustainable Communities that consideration would be given in consultation with the voluntary and co-operative sector, to pilot a tenant purchase scheme for some new voluntary homes based on the incremental purchase model.The modalities of such a scheme have been the subject of ongoing discussion between my Department and representatives of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector including the Irish Council for Social Housing and National Association of Building Co-operatives.  My Department is liaising with a number of these organisations with a view to selecting a number of potential projects for inclusion in a pilot tenant purchase scheme.  The introduction of such a scheme including any legislative element, will be determined as soon as possible.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1112	Generally, planning permission is needed for any development of land or property unless the development is specifically exempted from this requirement.  The provision of a hard surface to the front or side of a house for the parking of not more than 2 motor vehicles is already exempt, under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, from the requirement to obtain planning permission, subject to certain conditions. However, this exemption does not include the widening of a gateway or access to the property.  These exemptions were revised and updated in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.The introduction of different planning application processes for different types of development would not necessarily deliver a more streamlined or simplified planning system overall.  The widening of a gate or access to a property may seem like a relatively minor development; however it may have significant impacts on road safety, neighbouring properties or the appearance of a house or row of houses.  Where this is the case, it is appropriate that these issues should fall to be considered by the planning code.In addition, given the potential implications of such works, the requirements of the current Regulations, which have been endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, are considered reasonable and appropriate.

The works to the collection system in Leixlip include proposals to eliminate the odour problem in Main Street.  The works in relation to Straffan were completed last year and my Department has no proposals from Kildare County Council for any further works in the Straffan area, including Bawnogue.  In January 2007 my Department approved Kildare County Council's contract documents for the network upgrading in the other locations.  My Department has also authorised the Council to prepare contract documents for the expansion of the Leixlip wastewater treatment plant.In December 2006, my Department approved Kildare County Council's Preliminary Report for the expansion of the wastewater treatment plant at Osberstown under the Upper Liffey Valley Sewerage Scheme.  It is now a matter for the Council to advance the production of contract documents for this element of the scheme.  The Council's Preliminary Report for the collection networks in Clane, Johnstown, Kilcullen, Kill, Naas, Newbridge, Prosperous and Sallins, all of which are part of this scheme, is under examination in my Department and is being dealt with as quickly as possible.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1114	The income eligibility and loan limits for the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme were reviewed and increased with effect from 1 January 2006.  The maximum loan that can be advanced by local authorities for the acquisition or construction of a house increased to €185,000.  The income eligibility for a single income household increased to €40,000, while in the case of a two income household, the income limit is based on the formula that 2½ times the main income plus once the secondary income does not exceed €100,000.  The income thresholds are examined on an annual basis to ensure they are meeting the needs of the target groups for which they are intended.  My Department will be completing, as soon as possible, a review in this regard which is currently underway.Those with incomes greater than the limits mentioned above may be eligible for affordable housing provided under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 — 2006 or the Affordable Housing Initiative.  Eligibility for these schemes is determined on the basis that a person's income is insufficient to meet the mortgage repayments on a house suitable to their needs, by virtue of the fact that the mortgage payments on such accommodation would exceed 35% of the person's income after tax and PRSI.  It is a matter for local authorities to keep under review the income ceiling applied in accordance with this formula in their areas, taking account, in particular, of changes in disposable income, house prices and mortgage servicing costs.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1117	The Programme for Government underlines our commitment to the development of an Irish biofuels market and to the development and deployment of bio-energy generally in Ireland.  A range of initiatives is already in place to support the development of the biofuels sector.The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief for a two-year period under the scheme.  The Biofuels Mineral Oil tax Relief Scheme II was introduced in 2006, valued at over €200m. Under this scheme sixteen projects have been awarded excise relief to the period 2010.  The scheme will enable us to reach an initial target of over 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008.  As a result of this scheme, biofuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at a number of existing petrol and diesel pumps, and higher blends are being sold to identified vehicle fleets.  The Government has also introduced a 50% VRT relief on Flexible Fuel Vehicles, which are capable of running on blends of up to 85% ethanol in petrol.  These vehicles are now available in Ireland from a number of car manufacturers.  The National Climate Change Strategy also commits to a realignment of VRT and Motor Tax to favour more energy efficient cars.  The planned introduction of a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.Grants for the conversion of diesel engine vehicles to use Pure Plant Oil (PPO) have been made available by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), working with the four companies who were granted excise relief under the PPO category in the Pilot Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme.  The Department of Transport is also funding specific biofuels initiatives and will publish a Sustainable Transport Action Plan later in 2007.Under the Programme for Government we will introduce a minimum requirement for the use of Biofuels in State-owned and public transport vehicles.  We will introduce biofuels in blends of up to 5% in existing Local Authority and CIE fleets and will achieve 30% in new vehicle purchases by CIE.

Under the Government's Decentralisation Programme these functions of the former Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources are to be relocated to Clonakilty in Co Cork. These functions are not included in those earmarked for decentralisation to Cavan and recent Departmental changes do not impact in that regard.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1119	The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities under the Regional Broadband Programme.Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Managed Services Entity.  The second phase will extend the programme to an additional 90 towns.  Under the first phase of the MANs programme the following Westmeath towns have received broadband infrastructure:Mullingar MAN provided an 18 km network;Athlone MAN provided a 20 km network.The construction of a 16.3 km MAN in Longford town under the second phase of the MANs programme has been completed and final arrangements are being made to hand the completed network over to an interim Managed Services Entity (MSE) until the appointment of a permanent MSE is announced following a competitive tender process which is under way.Despite Government investment in broadband in the regions through the regional broadband programme, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  The procurement process for the Government's new National Broadband Scheme (NBS) was launched on the 2 May 2007.  This scheme will provide broadband services to the areas of Ireland that are currently unserved and ensure that every reasonable request for broadband in these unserved areas is met.  The estimated timescale for the award of the NBS contract is December 2007.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1120	Under the Programme for Government we will dramatically accelerate the growth of renewable energy sources in the electricity, heating and transport sectors of the economy.  One third of all electricity consumed will come from renewable energy by 2020.  Accelerated progress in the use of renewable sources in both the heating and transport sectors will reduce dependence on non-renewable energy sources.  Radically improved energy efficiency and demand management will lead to real reductions in energy use and thus reduce dependence on non-renewable energy sources.  Taken together therefore, sustained reductions in demand due to efficiency gains and steadily expanding our deployment of clean renewable fuels will be key to reducing over reliance on oil and gas.The use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in Ireland is statutorily prohibited under Section 18 subsection 6 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  It is also relevant in this context that Section 3 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 Act amends the Planning and Development Act 2000 to state that "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as enabling the authorisation of development consisting of an installation for the generation of electricity by nuclear fission."The Energy Policy Framework makes it clear that the Government fully intends to maintain the statutory prohibition on nuclear generation in Ireland.  The Government strongly believes that nuclear power is neither sustainable nor an answer to Ireland's energy needs.  The actions set out in the Programme for Government in relation to nuclear energy and Sellafield are a clear statement of our position and our intent in Europe in relation to nuclear energy.

I am advised that ESB has an infrastructure maintenance programme for the continual upkeep of its MV Substations and Unit Substations as well as all minipillars, including inspection and necessary repairs.  The contact number for ESB Networks, 1850 372 999, is widely publicised and is the first regular point of contact for customers wishing to report any issue regarding ESB infrastructure.  ESB are also introducing a new danger notice on all substations and minipillars which will include the ESB Networks emergency numbers.Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ) is committed to the highest standards of safety which includes national safety and emergency awareness campaigns across television, radio and print media where the company's 24-hour gas emergency number, 1850 20 50 50, is highlighted to the public.  The emergency number is also very prominently displayed in the telephone directories.  The awareness policy also includes the display of the 24-hour emergency number on BGÉ's infrastructure installations, where feasible.  For domestic supplies the emergency contact number is on every bill, which has been found by BGÉ to be most effective.
