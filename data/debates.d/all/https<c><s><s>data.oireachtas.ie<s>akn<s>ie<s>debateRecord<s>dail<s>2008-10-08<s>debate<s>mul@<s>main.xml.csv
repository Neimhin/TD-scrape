#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I understand the Government has not yet finalised the guarantee scheme so the Taoiseach is not in a position to answer on that matter.  However, I wish to refer to an area over which he has control.In today's newspaper the Taoiseach states that next week will be a defining moment for Ireland.  In the recent past he pointed out that no one will escape the consequences of managing our economy and he stated that greed is a human failing and has not been absent from Ireland.  On the day he made that comment, the HSE set up a bonus system for 2009 of €1.4 million, a 20% increase on 2008.  On average, there are 300 people on trolleys every day, there have been serious cases of misdiagnosis and deaths from cancer, particularly among women, some 1,200 acute beds are unused and, this morning, it was announced that a rehabilitation facility will be closed.  There is still no fair deal for those under economic pressure because of the cost of nursing homes.  That is a performance that does not warrant a 20% increase in bonuses over 2008.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	2	It does not warrant any bonus increase.  The Taoiseach is not responsible for everything but he is responsible in the main for the economic mess in which we find ourselves.  Having checked with HSE authorities around the country, the bonus in place for 2009 will make matters worse when one considers what will happen in community and primary care facilities next year.  I am reliably informed that when the Taoiseach brings in the defining moment next week, there will be cuts of at least 300,000 hours in home help, no walking aids, no wheelchairs, no new physios, occupational therapists or speech therapists appointed and a serious curtailment of home care packages with the result that the vulnerable, those who sustained the country in the creation of the Celtic tiger, will be neglected.  There is no question about it.In July, the Government said that the 3% cutback in payroll would not affect education and health.  Whatever else he must do in respect of able-bodied people, the Taoiseach should not take the political cleaver to the quality of life of the old and vulnerable, who cannot speak or act for themselves.  I would like the Taoiseach to give me an answer on whether he stands over the position where, in advance of what we know will happen in that sector, the HSE is in a position to set up a bonus increase of 20%, amounting to €1.4 million.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The contractual arrangements and conditions of employment in respect of the HSE and its staff refer to the recommendations of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector.  This is about trying to ensure one provides a pay scale that relates to performance based on setting targets.  The principles of higher remuneration in the public sector were about trying to bring comparability to the private sector to get such practices in place.  Awards should be related to the achievement of highly demanding and challenging targets and stretch objectives that are difficult to achieve.  The scheme provides for the payment of awards after the year end where it has been determined that the prior agreed stretched objectives have been met.

Clearly, I expect it will take into account the new economic situation with which we are contending.While bonus schemes can be in place, the question of whether they are approved and paid depends on these performance related issues being confirmed and completed over the period of that year.  It relates to management issues involving officers in the HSE to which this applies.  On the more general point made by Deputy Kenny, the Government is doing all it can to maintain, to the greatest extent possible, the service levels built up over time.  We are in a new economic situation and we must deal with the current budgetary position.  We are trying to address that as equitably as possible.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It goes back to the point that no one on the Government benches will accept responsibility for anything.  The current situation was signed off under the Taoiseach as Minister for Finance, with reckless spending and no management of the value for money secured from what was spent over the past number of years.  Lehman Brothers is not responsible for the fact that there will be a serious reduction in home help packages, no walking aids and no wheelchairs next year.The minutes of the HSE meeting on 9 April were given to Deputy Andrew Doyle in response to a question.  These point out that the HSE, set up by the Government and reckoned by the Minister for Health and Children to be a once in a generation move to provide world class health services, is now being deconstructed by the same Government because it has failed.   During its deconstruction, McKinsey consultancy was employed at a cost of almost €1 million to point out how it should be done.  The minutes of the board meeting state it discussed key design principles and requirements to maximise organisational effectiveness and deliver greater integrated service management.  It has cost almost €1 million to deconstruct something described as a once in a generation move to provide world-class health services.This morning, President Sarkozy stated there should be no more bonuses or dividends and the same is being stated in the United States and Britain.  Here we are, under the tutorship of the Taoiseach, having agreed a 20% increase in bonus payments for the HSE when many areas of our health services are faced with decimation, particularly those dealing with the old, vulnerable, weak and voiceless.  The Taoiseach stated there would be no cutbacks or 3% payroll reduction in frontline health services.  If the Taoiseach proceeds down this line, whatever else he has to do with able bodied people he should not attack the old, weak or vulnerable.I would like the Taoiseach, as director of affairs in the country, to state that based on its performance and what we know will happen next year, the bonus scheme for the HSE will not be paid.  Allowing another €1 million to be spent in consultancy, as was pointed out to Deputy Doyle, in breaking up what the Minister for Health and Children stated would provide world-class health services speaks for itself in terms of the type of management, effectiveness and non-acceptance of responsibility of this Government for anything that happens.  It is all independent advice.  Will the Taoiseach deal with this?

That is how it is in respect of every bonus payment scheme.With regard to the more general issue related to consultancy and the McKinsey report, this issue is to ensure that in the reorganisation which has been taking place the management system interrelates between the community care system and the acute hospital system.  Changes are being made to ensure this join-up is there and that is a good thing.  A lot of work has also been done on reviewing the personnel management of the operation and the Minister for Finance will have views on this and will discuss them with the House next week.  This is all part of a major reorganisation taking place in the health service.

Last week, we were told the Government would introduce a scheme this week to set down the conditions under which the guarantee was being provided.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach told us the scheme is not yet finalised.  From what we hear, it may be next week before we see the terms of the scheme.  I understand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, stated in an interview this morning that it has been delayed because of the scheme announced in the United Kingdom.A week after the legislation was introduced, we are still unsure what exactly we have guaranteed.  We do not know the terms or conditions of the guarantee provided and we do not know what will come back to the taxpayer in return for the guarantee provided.  In the absence of the scheme we were promised what guarantee is now in place?  Do I understand correctly that in the absence of a scheme, the guarantee is, in effect, the statement the Government issued on 30 September?  If so, as of now does the guarantee only extend to the six banks named in the statement?  How is the guarantee extended to the other financial institutions which I understood were to apply on the basis of the scheme?  What exactly is the nature of the guarantee and what is its status as of now?Will the Taoiseach clarify an aspect of the Government statement of 30 September?  Reference was made to dated subordinated debt — lower tier two — being subject to the State guarantee.  As I understand it, this debt is the arrangement whereby very wealthy people make money available to the banks, effectively as a loan, and receive far higher interest than a normal depositor because the understanding is that if anything goes wrong with the banks the money is gone.The guarantee scheme announced by the Government last week provides a State guarantee for this form of debt.  We have seen a number of schemes introduced by other states such as Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom.  None of these arrangements provides a guarantee or cover for dated subordinated debt.Why was this form of debt included in the Irish scheme?  Approximately how much of this debt exists?  I am advised it could be in the order of €10 billion.  It is high-risk money provided by high net worth people to the banks on very high interest rates.  According to this scheme we have provided a taxpayers' guarantee for it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	30	With regard to the guarantee scheme, this has been an evolving situation.  I want to make it clear to the House that work on the scheme being carried out by officials of the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator is continuing with a view to finalising it as quickly as possible.  The boards of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the Central Bank discussed the scheme on Monday evening and they will feed their recommendations into the finalisation of the scheme.  It is important to stress the need for discussion on the draft scheme later this week between the Irish authorities and the European Commission with regard to EU state aids and competition requirements.As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Finance met the EU Commissioner for Competition on Monday evening to discuss the Government's approach and contacts are ongoing as the work proceeds.  The issues discussed at the meeting between Commissioner Kroes and the Minister for Finance currently are being factored into the drafting of the scheme.  A particular priority in this regard is to ensure the scheme appropriately addresses the issues of subsidiaries of overseas parents operating in Ireland with a substantial retail main street presence.I assure the Deputy that it is a priority to ensure the scheme will be laid before the House as soon as possible.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Commissioner both agreed it was important to take steps to guard against any undue distortions of financial flows and the Minister indicated that such concerns would be addressed through the implementing measures currently being drafted, which will provide for controls and quantitative balance sheet controls.  This is the up to date position and it is important to point out that the breaking situation in the United Kingdom also must be factored into our considerations here.I make the point that as the House passed the legislation last week on foot of the statement given by the Government on the morning in question, it was setting out its preparedness to stand behind the banking system and the six main banks in the State.  Subsequently, in the course of discussions, both inside and outside this House, suggestions were made as to whether it would be possible to incorporate into the scheme other banks that were not on the list for reasons already outlined by the Minister.  Consideration of this issue continues and important questions must be clarified and addressed in respect of wider group liabilities in the event of anything happening to a subsidiary here.

On the basis of the advice we have received from the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, the assets of the banks to which the guarantee relates exceed their liabilities.  We are not including tier one capital arrangements, which includes equity or equity-like instruments.  However, all other liabilities are being guaranteed by the State on the basis of the advice from those who are competent to so advise the Government.Members should remember the purpose of this guarantee is to ensure that our banking system has access to adequate liquidity, in order that we can obtain the time and space to ascertain the manner in which the banking system may be restructured over time or developed in a way that will overcome this problem.  The immediate issue before the Government was the liquidity question and it had to be addressed very quickly.  On the advice of those from whom the Government should take advice in this regard——
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The banks.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	50	——this was the arrangement to which the Government came.  I believe this arrangement has helped to bring some stabilisation to the liquidity question.  The further issue as to how the banks should move from here is an issue that must be dealt with by the sector, by regulation and by ourselves as we interact with them on the basis of the guarantee scheme when it comes before the House for approval.While I would have liked to have thought we would have it by now, it was not and is not possible to finalise those arrangements until we take into account every aspect of this situation based on the arrangements that have been happening across the water.  I note the Chancellor of the Exchequer has indicated it will take the British Government some time to work out the details on how it will proceed.  It is clear, on the basis of its statement this morning, how it intends to proceed.  That is its view as to how it should respond in its situation.  The Government here decided how it would respond in our situation.  I assure the House that every care is being taken to bring about a position whereby we will have a scheme that will meet the requirements of the situation we have announced ourselves and which will ascertain whether it is possible or appropriate for the Government to accommodate others that have a strong retail presence here.  The Government has had ongoing and constructive discussions with those parties.  In addition, we must ensure that on arriving at that point, the European Commission also is satisfied that we have met the considerations and issues it has raised with the Minister for Finance when he met Commissioner Kroes.  This sets out the context and reason for our actions and I hope this constitutes a response to the specific questions raised by Deputy Gilmore.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	51	First, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom announced conditions attaching to the British package that have not been attached to the Irish package.  I note the British proposals include conditions relating to taking an equity share in banks, to restricting payment of dividends and putting restrictions on the reward and remuneration packages of top executives of banks, all of which remain open-ended in Ireland.  This is not helpful and I am becoming concerned by the delay in bringing forward the scheme because this delay is creating a degree of uncertainty again about what is happening in the banking world.  In the meantime, we appear to have some kind of open-ended unqualified guarantee for the banks.I wish to revert to the specific question I asked about dated subordinated debt.  No other scheme to provide a rescue or support package for the banks in any other country has included this form of debt.  This is the form of debt that comes next after equity if something goes wrong.  Interest is earned on such instruments at a far higher rate than is earned on a normal deposit.  The reason for this is the understanding that such money is at risk if something goes wrong.  The scheme the Government announced last week, for a reason I cannot understand, has included this form of debt and has provided a guarantee for it.  I have been informed that in the couple of weeks preceding the Government's announcement last week, a great deal of trading took place in this stuff.  People were trying to off-load some subordinated debt at a discounted rate and one could purchase some of it for approximately 80% of what it originally was worth.  Suddenly, an Irish guarantee scheme guaranteed it to the value of 100%.  I am told, for example, that one of the six banking institutions listed in the Government's statement has something like €2 billion of subordinated debt.  Why was it included in the Irish scheme?  Who decided or recommended that it should be included in the Irish scheme?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	59	We have heard enough of that sort of nonsense.  They are the bodies that provide advice.As for the availability of liquidity in the banks, obviously every area of liquidity that can be obtained must be obtained and retained by the banks to the greatest extent possible. It related to capital inflows as a result of the guarantee being provided and whatever liquidity or capital they had in the banks themselves.  It is important to make the point that this is the basis upon which the advice is given and taken.The actions of the UK were mentioned and they must make their decisions as they see them under their circumstances.  What they or we do depends on our respective circumstances.  They already had nationalisation of banks and some guarantees being given to banks.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the British Government and its Prime Minister do what they believe is the right thing.  They must come up with £50 billion up front as part of a recapitalisation process at this time.  They see it as appropriate, coupled with the availability of long-term debt to the tune of perhaps £200 billion.  It is their intention to acquire preference shares as a result.That is fine as it is their approach and business.  I have no comment to make on that one way or another and I am sure they are well advised.  We take our advice from our own people.  I believed the way to deal with the issue, based on all the advice we received on that occasion, was to act in the way we did.  It was essential to our national interest that we acted and we did on the basis of the advice available from the appropriate authorities.  That is the basis upon which Government works, as the Deputy knows.

I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen.  The meeting was an excellent opportunity to build on our bilateral relationship as Ireland and Wales share many economic, cultural and social areas of interest, including the promotion of the Irish and Welsh languages.  I briefed the First Minister on political developments in Northern Ireland and we discussed economic issues and the important role education can play for future prosperity.  We also discussed efforts to encourage students to study science and engineering.I attended the 11th British-Irish Council summit hosted by the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, in Edinburgh on 26 September.  The summit was attended by representatives of all members of the council, including the Northern Ireland Executive.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan and Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Pat Carey.The council is a valuable forum to exchange information and discuss issues of mutual interest.  At the summit on 26 September, we discussed the current global economic position, as well as demography and energy issues.  The council agreed to adopt an early years policy work stream, with Wales leading.  We were also updated on the strategic review of the council and mandated the secretariat to continue its work with a view to presenting final proposals for consideration at the next summit in Wales next February.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I know the Taoiseach is a sporting man.  He is quite entitled to go to the Heineken European Rugby Cup final.  I found it amusing, to say the least, that the Taoiseach and two Ministers were heading off to Wales for a meeting with Mr. Morgan, the First Minister, on the very day the match was taking place.  I would have thought a decent man from Offaly like the Taoiseach would have said he was going to the Heineken cup final and when over there, he was going to meet with the First Minister as well.It seems to be couched in a way that the Taoiseach would be going to the meeting and, by the way, to the match with the two Ministers.  That was not the way to do it.  The Taoiseach is entitled to go to a match if he so wishes.  I thought this was not the way to present his case.

If the Deputy asks a supplementary question I can clarify the position.  It is not a big deal.  The bottom line is I met Mr. Rhodri Morgan on a number of occasions.

It is not a big deal.We discussed various issues about Wales and Ireland, our bilateral relationship, promotion of the Irish and Welsh languages and his interest in education.  He has a very good knowledge of the country, as the Deputy knows, and has visited here on many occasions with his good wife.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	105	With regard to the Omagh bombing, new evidence has emerged which suggests the electronic intelligence agency in Britain, the GCHQ, monitored exchanges between the bombers on the day in question.  It is also believed that at a meeting of the Home Office a year later chaired by the head of MI5, there may well have been discussion of the early use of intercepted calls to prosecute the persons involved which may well have prevented that bombing.A recent programme the Taoiseach will be aware of in the "Panorama" series brought this new evidence to light.  It also stated the biggest complication facing the Criminal Investigation Department, or CID, in what was then the RUC was that although the bombing was committed in its jurisdiction, some 80% of the suspects lived in the Irish Republic, thus falling under the jurisdiction of An Garda Síochána.  Despite assurances from both Governments that the police forces were co-operating, there were in reality two separate and parallel inquiries.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the British Prime Minister has ordered a review of the intercepted intelligence material.Arising from this, has the Taoiseach been in touch with the British authorities about this new information?  Does he agree with the report that there were weaknesses in the investigation and are there any changes consequential to this meaning a renewed co-operation on the investigation might come about?  I say this against the background of the possibility that the tragedy of Omagh and the loss of life felt so deeply by the entire community, particularly the families involved, may not have occurred if the intercepted calls had been acted upon.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	116	As I indicated, the Council exchanged information and discussed issues related to the current global economic position, as well as demographic and energy issues.  The question of the extent to which we can develop offshore energy infrastructure between Northern Ireland and Scotland, with the possible involvement of other jurisdictions, arose on the energy side.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, attended the meeting.On the issue of demographics and its impact on social policy, a general discussion took place on the demographic position in each jurisdiction and what was being done to try to deal with impending demographic change and its impact on public policy generally.  The economic situation was discussed in terms of ongoing events around the world and how they were affecting the individual jurisdictions represented at the forum.It was also suggested Wales take on a work stream on policies it was proposing on early years development and how other countries could learn from them.  Child protection issues were also discussed and representatives of the Isle of Man indicated that a particular issue arose in their jurisdiction and that they were anxious to set out their position.  The First Minister and Deputy First Minister also discussed that topic from a Northern Ireland perspective.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 21, inclusive, together.The visit of President George Bush to Northern Ireland in June as part of his European tour was an opportunity for the Irish, British and United States Governments to meet the political parties to discuss a range of political and economic issues.  When President Bush, Prime Minister Brown and I met First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, we expressed our strong support for the work of the Executive and stressed the need to move forward on the critical issue of policing and justice.  I met Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness again in Omagh on 15 August and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, met Secretary of State Shaun Woodward on Thursday, 18 September.On 3 September the Governments published the 19th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission which provided clarity on the status of the Provisional IRA.  The Government welcomed the very positive report and I thank the IMC for its hard work in preparing it and its continuing contribution to the peace process.  Following on from the decommissioning of its weapons, the IRA has now completely stood down the structures which engaged in its armed campaign.I met the First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness together with their ministerial colleagues at the British-Irish Council summit hosted by the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, in Edinburgh on Friday, 26 September.  I spoke again on the telephone with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister last week.The Government is disappointed that the Executive did not meet on Thursday, 2 October and that this led to the postponement of the scheduled plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council last Friday.  Our agenda for North-South co-operation is important for all of the people and business on the island.  The North-South Ministerial Council is a vital institution of the Good Friday Agreement and its work must continue.While there are a range of difficult issues to address, I hope the current issues of disagreement within the Executive can be resolved, as the First Minister and Deputy First Minister indicated last week at their joint appearance at Stormont.  We remain in close contact with the British Government and parties in the Northern Ireland Executive and will continue to offer support in resolving these difficulties.We want the Executive and all the institutions working in the best way possible for the people of Northern Ireland.  That is the only way forward.  All of the commitments in the St. Andrews Agreement have been implemented, except the devolution of policing and justice.  This remains the central outstanding issue.  It is the view of both the Irish and British Governments that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly should take on this responsibility.  I spoke to Prime Minister Gordon Brown in advance of his visit to Northern Ireland on Tuesday, 16 September and again last week. I welcome his encouragement of the parties to resolve this matter and expect to meet him again shortly.The Executive has had impressive achievements — an agreed programme for government and budget and investment strategy provide a sound basis for progress.  The continuing message that Northern Ireland is open for business and that devolution is working will be vital for the success of the Northern Ireland economy which faces the same uncertainty and risks as other economies face.  It is important that the Executive gets down to business to address the difficult challenges ahead.With the restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland in 2007, there are no current proposals to reconvene the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  While the forum has played a role in the past, I do not expect further meetings in the current circumstances.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I apologise if I was out of order in asking an earlier question which may not have been relevant to the British-Irish Council meeting in Scotland.  I hope it is now relevant to the Northern Ireland situation.  As the "Panorama" programme explained, there is evidence that the United Kingdom's electronic surveillance intelligence service intercepted calls between the Omagh bombers before the bomb exploded.  Apparently, the matter was discussed in the Home Office at a meeting chaired by the head of MI5.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on this matter and has he contacted the British authorities about it?  What, if any, changes have been implemented in order that renewed co-operation can take place in the investigation of the Omagh bombing?Arising from the Taoiseach's comments in respect of the Northern Ireland Assembly, as I have previously pointed out, the army council of the IRA continues to exist.  While others hold a different view, it is my view that the council is no longer required.  What is the Taoiseach's view?  Should the Assembly get on with the business for which it was elected, despite the existence, albeit inactive, of the army council?In April this year the Taoiseach and First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, announced that firms operating in the IFSC could establish offices in Northern Ireland to help them cope with the current skills deficit in the South.  Analysts suggested the initiative had the potential to create between 3,000 and 5,000 well paid jobs in Northern Ireland, which would enjoy higher tax receipts through job creation.  Will the Taoiseach provide a progress report on the issue?  How many, if any, meetings have taken place about the initiative since April?  Does the Taoiseach know how many jobs have been created?  What Exchequer gain, if any, has Northern Ireland achieved so far from the announcement he made?  Has this had an impact on the Exchequer receipts of the Government here?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	125	In regard to the Deputy's first matter, again, as I said, issues involving intelligence and security are dealt with by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of his ongoing contact with his counterparts across the water.  I understand that various assertions or contentions were made in a television programme which are being followed up on the British side.  As soon as that is done, I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can speak to his counterpart about it and ascertain if it has brought to light anything of significance beyond what we know already.  I know this is a continuing difficulty for the families and a very difficult situation.  We will continue to work constructively to assist in whatever way we can on those matters.On the question of the IRA standing down the army council, as I understand it, the IMC brought forward a very positive report in this respect, confirming that this is the case.  The de facto position is that there is no activity going on from that source in respect of planning armed campaigns or being involved in organising anything that would be against the spirit or letter of the Agreement.  It is important that we accept the IMC reports as they are provided to us as a continuing contribution to the peace process.  That allied to the decommissioning of weapons is a very solid indication of the irreversible path that has now been taken.  That should be accepted and we should move on.On the question of the initiative with Peter Robinson, that is a matter for the private sector to take up should it so wish.  What I was simply doing was showing the ability of North and South to co-operate together in an area where there could be mutual benefit.  It is not a matter I monitor on a monthly, weekly or bimonthly basis; it is simply a positive indication to the people on both sides of the Border that it is possible to devise strategies and common approaches which address issues from our and their points of view.  There is a need for us to continue to explore and exploit across a whole range of public policy how we can demonstrate to our constituents on both sides of the Border that this is possible, doable and that there is a political will to get on with it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I share with the Taoiseach the hope that the efforts being made to get the Northern Ireland Executive meeting again will succeed.  It is disappointing it has not met for quite some time.  Is the Taoiseach optimistic that meetings of it will resume in the near future?With regard to the Omagh bombing, what was contained in the "Panorama" programme was extremely serious.  Apparently GCHQ was in possession of information which, if it had been passed on in time to the RUC, could possibly have prevented the Omagh bombing and certainly would have led to the detection of those responsible for it.  Do I understand from what the Taoiseach said that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will follow this up with the British authorities?  Do I understand then that the contents of that programme have not yet been followed up with the British authorities?What is the Taoiseach's attitude to the recommendation made jointly by the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in early 2007 that a judge of international standing should be appointed by both Governments to review the available information about that bombing and the state of knowledge of the security services both on this island and on the neighbouring island in regard to it?  Will the Government pursue that idea with the British Government to have a review conducted by a judge of international standing of the available information on it?In respect of the North-South parliamentary forum that has been talked about for some time, what progress has been made to establish it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	127	In regard to the first matter raised by the Deputy, one must continue to be hopeful that we can overcome the difficulties that have arisen and we will continue to work to see if they can be resolved.  It has been disappointing that has not been the case thus far.  The deferral or postponement of Executive meetings is not a good practice in terms of developing relationships and trust.  It has been disappointing that it has not been possible to overcome the problems that exist.Looking back on the St. Andrews Agreement, it is important to point out that it was the view of the Taoiseach and Prime Minister at the time that, were we able to fulfil all the issues set out in that Agreement, it should constitute the conditions necessary to enable us to proceed to the devolution of policing in Northern Ireland.  My understanding from all sides is that while everyone is committed to that, the ability to set out an indicative timeline in which that might occur has not been possible to achieve on a consensual basis within the Executive.  The question of there being sufficient public support to enable that to happen is an issue that remains in the background before the decision seems to be capable of being taken.  It is important that every effort be made to reinforce the point that, from opinion polls of which I am aware and from my knowledge of the situation on the ground, there is not a principled objection among any notable swathe of public opinion in Northern Ireland to  this happening.However, there is a need, at the political level, to try to find a framework in which it would be possible for everyone to proceed, with the satisfaction of all that this has full, wide and cross-community support contemporaneously with moving on the issue, so that we can get to the devolution position more quickly than would otherwise be the case.  It seems that is the best means by which we could try to encourage people to move on this issue more quickly than they feel is available at the moment.  It is a difficult question, one that we need to try to resolve and that we are prepared to work with the parties to try to resolve as quickly as possible.  The wider impact it has on the fact that the Executive is not meeting is also exacerbating the problem and magnifying the issues under discussion.In regard to the question of the television programme, that matter is being reviewed by the British Administration as to its veracity or whatever in terms of whether it had the impact that it was suggested it would have had in the television programme.  The only point I would make is that, for the purpose of accuracy, it would be best to table a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to precisely what is the current position.  I have not discussed it with him since then.On the question of what the various Human Rights Commissions are proposing, there is the issue that some of this is still before the courts in terms of, as I understand it, the prosecution that is being taken.  There is also the whole question of a civil action being taken by the parents of the victims in this appalling atrocity.  Trying to uncover the truth is important for the parents, some of whom I met.  However, it is also a question of trying to find the best way to do that.  Encouraging more people to review and oversee various aspects of this matter has not provided a remedy or led to those involved being satisfied about getting to the nub of the issue.  There are legal and other background issues which are not easy to sort out.The ombudsman examined the matter and there has been a great deal of detailed investigation into it.  A recent television programme highlighted the issue and the British Administration is examining that.  We will continue to assist in whatever way we can in trying to get those responsible for this atrocity before the courts and in ensuring, if possible, that they are successfully prosecuted.  As the Deputy is aware, legal moves are continuing in the background.

Go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire ar a h-anam.Will the Taoiseach acknowledge and accept that Sinn Féin is totally committed to partnership Government and to full participation in the Northern Ireland Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council and the various other committees and cross-Border institutions that have been established under the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement?  Does he accept that the current difficulties — we all hope these will be overcome as quickly as possible — are attributable to the fact that one of the participant parties at the Northern Ireland Assembly is refusing to agree executive agendas?  Does the Taoiseach agree that certain issues are long overdue for address and that these were to have been dealt with in the context of the British-Irish Agreement and that the matters discussed in the course of negotiations on the St. Andrews Agreement, including the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast, must be delivered upon?  Does he accept that several months have passed since the stated date, namely, May of this year, for the implementation of that decision?Does the Taoiseach accept that partnership requires agreement on the part of all the principal parties in order that progress might be made and that in refusing to act in partnership, the DUP is causing the current difficulties?  I assure him that my party will continue to work to overcome this impasse.  What efforts will the Taoiseach and the Government make to encourage the development of forward momentum on this matter and the acceptance of partnership?  Does the Taoiseach agree that this matter involves more than policing and justice, Acht na Gaeilge or any other issue and that it relates to the acceptance of partnership?  The absence of the latter is the real cause of the current difficulties.Has the Taoiseach been briefed on the campaign organised by the families of those killed in the Ballymurphy area by the British Army's parachute regiment in August 1971?  What steps does he intend to take in the context of raising this matter with the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, in a way that would be supportive of the families' request for a full, independent inquiry into the deaths of their loved ones and of a local priest in 1971?  When the Taoiseach met Mr. Brown, did he receive a report regarding negotiations between the British Government and representatives of the Unionist paramilitaries — the Ulster Political Research Group — on the issue of weapons?  He addressed this matter earlier in the context of his acknowledgement of the IRA's action in this regard.  Has the Taoiseach been given an insight into contacts between the British Government and the Ulster Political Research Group on the important issue of weapons held by Unionist paramilitaries?  Will he acknowledge the British Government's role in having this matter satisfactorily resolved, that is, ensuring the weapons to which I refer are completely taken out of the equation?  The British are best placed in this regard because they were responsible for providing many of those weapons in the first instance.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I join Deputy Ó Caoláin in offering my sympathy to Martin McGuinness and the other members of his family on the death of their mother.  I did so personally yesterday in any event.I accept that Sinn Féin is committed to partnership.  It is important that we get everyone around the table in a working relationship.  It is correct that certain issues are long overdue for resolution and that partnership requires agreement.  We will do anything we can to assist in that regard.  Ultimately, however, people in the Northern Ireland Executive must work together.  A solution cannot only be imposed from outside, it must also come from within.In attempting to resolve the problem, there might be some benefit in trying to encourage people to work together in order to confirm that there is cross-community support for this issue.  I accept that the conditions necessary to facilitate this happening are, for many people and in many respects, already in place.  I am not arguing about that but we must encourage everyone to agree to the proposal.  In some respects it is better to test the response from the other side by engaging to see if a way can be found through this on the basis of building confidence on a cross-community basis for this process, while confirming that there is no question of not moving ahead with a devolution process.  If people can reach an accommodation in respect of this idea, progress can and should be made.The detail of how this will work must be agreed, and there is some work and discussion to take place in that regard.  It should be possible to arrange for this in parallel.  People can say that the date when all of this should have happened has passed.  It is a case of trying to find a via media, even in circumstances where people are inquiring as to what the discussion involves at this stage.  It would be important that we establish the partnership necessary to make the entire Northern Ireland Executive work.  The Executive has major potential in the context of working well for all the people across a range of issues.  We have hit an impasse in respect of this important issue.  I do not for a moment suggest this is not an important issue.  This is a critical issue and is one in respect of which many steps have been taken.  Sinn Féin has shown leadership on this question, and that is to be acknowledged.Even allowing for the effort on Sinn Féin's part, there is a need to try to find a way forward rather than feeling we can go no further at this stage.  The disagreement relating to this matter is affecting everything else and there are potential consequences which everyone should try to avoid.  We will continue to work to see if there is a way round it.  In the end, an agreement must be made face to face by the parties concerned with regard to how to move this forward.  I regret we are in the position we are now in and I would rather we were not in it.  Arguments can be put forward as to why this should be behind us at this stage, but, at the same time, we should be able to find some process that will provide us with the outcome required on the basis that it is a critical issue.  There is no objection to that in principle; it is just a question of finding a narrative with which everyone can live as we proceed and get to that point.  I do not believe it need be a point in time that is way out in the future.

Having regard to the specific mandate given to that body under the British-Irish Agreement and to the fact that it specifically states that the commission should mirror the legislation and mandate of its sister body in Northern Ireland, does the Taoiseach consider such a proposed merger and dilution to be detrimental to the letter of the Good Friday Agreement?

I do not have any views one way or the other with regard to what organisational format should be provided.  Generally speaking, the party opposite would be of the view we should, where possible, try to increase the level of responsibility of some of these organisations and see whether we can pull them together.  On the point made by Deputy Flanagan regarding the Good Friday Agreement, no re-organisation should in any way take away from the confidence that has been built up in these organisations in respect of the human rights work they are doing.  We are cognisant of what the Deputy suggests, but we must try to see if both objectives can be met.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Will the Taoiseach elaborate on when he expects the matter of the structure of the guarantee for the banks and financial institutions will be discussed in the House?  I understood it was the Government's intention to bring it in yesterday, but the Government was to meet yesterday evening — which it did — and again today.  The last the Fine Gael Whip heard was that it was to be on Thursday.I suggest that, if it is ready, we will facilitate the Dáil sitting on Friday, Saturday or Monday to facilitate the debate.  I suggest this for several reasons.  First, the budget is due on Tuesday next.  That is a major event and the Government will not want the two matters in the House at the same time.  Second, the Taoiseach has to travel to Brussels on Wednesday for a Heads of Government meeting to give his views on Europe and the path ahead.  Another reason I suggest we have it now is because there is evidence from all over the country of the squeeze banks are putting on small businesses, which I understand is related to the liquidity problem.  There is an urgency on the part of the Taoiseach to get the structure right, but it is also urgent to get it through here, because the guarantee will not take effect until passed by the Houses.While there is a guarantee in place in name, in political or legal terms this can have no impact until it has been passed by the Houses.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on the situation?  If it is necessary for the Dáil to sit on Friday, Saturday or Monday, Fine Gael is willing to agree to that to facilitate Government bringing the scheme before the House so we can discuss it, find out the details and implications and tease it out so that, in so far as is possible, the political response in supporting a banking system and the economy can be got right.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on this matter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The point being made by Deputy Kenny demonstrates the problem involved with people asking us to be specific about when something will be brought to the House and we in good faith saying it should be here next week, but then other developments take place in the interim.  Initially we were talking about the six Irish banks, as set out in the original guarantee statement.  Concerns arose during the debate and we sought to accommodate those.  There have also been meetings in Paris and Luxembourg.  The competition Commissioner had something to say on the issue and the Bundesbank also discussed the matter.  Issues arise and the matter moves on, and we had a further development this morning.This is not a static situation.  However, this does not mean the Government is not clear about its objectives.  It is, but we must ensure we cover all the angles.  We are considering extending the guarantee, at the request of many Members and their view of the retail presence of some banks whose head offices are incorporated elsewhere.  We must try to ensure we take into account all the aspects of extending the guarantee.  There are also technical issues that must be addressed.  There has been constructive engagement with those parties and they will return to us during the course of today to provide some of the clarifications we need to be satisfied as to where this is going and as to whether we should consider it sympathetically or positively at that stage.  That is the current situation.Arising from what has been happening over the weekend and what the Minister for Finance has heard from the competition Commissioner — following constructive engagement — we have said we will keep in touch with the Commission during the course of this week as we finalise arrangements so we can ensure that we find something that will be regarded as compatible with requirements.  Otherwise, we would have to return to deal with the issue.  We want to deal with the issue appropriately, sequentially and as comprehensively as possible.We are very clear as to our objectives, but we want to ensure that the technical detail is such that it meets the requirements of everybody concerned and is as accommodating as possible without taking on inordinate risk.  On that basis, it seems clear it will be next week before we take this scheme.  I think it will probably be Wednesday afternoon or some time after the budget and budget debate.  It may be possible to deal with it on Wednesday or Thursday next week.  That would be the sensible approach, based on the state of play as matters stand today.  That is the route we should take considering what has to be done, who we are talking to and that they have to return to us to confirm their views.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I understand the complexities of what the Taoiseach is doing.  I merely ask that he instruct his office to keep the Opposition parties briefed on what is happening.It is not appropriate to debate this alongside the budget.  The Taoiseach will have a lot to contend with and he will also have to explain his position in Brussels.  While this matter is absolutely critical, dealing with it before or after the budget may be more appropriate.  I am sure many Deputies will want to ask questions about the conditions attached, the scale of the problem and the challenge and whether, in so far as this House is concerned, all bases have been covered.  If it is to be debated subsequent to the budget, it should not be immediately afterwards.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will see to it that we are kept informed on the progress being made in regard to when we can get a fix on this, if he does not mind.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The arrangements that the Taoiseach has outlined are wholly unsatisfactory for a number of reasons.  We are flying blind.  A guarantee scheme was enacted last week but we still do not have the details or the scheme.  The essential information which the public wants is not yet available.The Taoiseach is uncertain about when this will be introduced.  He speaks about introducing it next week and said that he would bring it in on the Wednesday following the Budget Statement.  By all accounts, this is going to be no ordinary budget but even in a normal year the Wednesday and Thursday of budget week are busy days in terms of our parliamentary work.  I do not know whether it can be done when the House sits on Tuesday or if we can sit on Monday.  I certainly think, however, that lumping it in with the budget on Wednesday and Thursday is madness.The Taoiseach has stated that it is being worked through, it is complicated and there is toing and froing with the Commission.  How big is the problem? What is the toing and froing? Last week, we were given to understand there was no major problem with the Commission in regard to the scheme. If that much toing and froing is happening, a problem of some kind has arisen somewhere and we are not being informed. The arrangements which the Taoiseach outlined are most unsatisfactory. I would like to raise other issues but I first wish to hear more from the Taoiseach on this matter.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	145	As I have said, as soon as the scheme is available, ready and approved by the Cabinet, it will be brought to the House and subject to the Whips' agreement on when it will be taken. Obviously, people are indicating that they would like to take it as quickly as possible. We are having a discussion and I was asked when I felt it could be taken, and I replied that it will be more than likely next week, based on the fact that the consultations to which I referred on Leaders' Questions are taking place.  The Deputy asked what the problem is, but it is not a question of a problem.  Many Members opposite took the view that we should extend the guarantee to other banks which have a retail presence here and that doing so should not be regarded as a problem but considered sympathetically.  However, issues arise about which we must be satisfied in terms of how we ring-fence the assets that will be available within this jurisdiction and what will be the view of the headquarters or parent group on the assets should anything occur.  All these technical issues have to be sorted out.  These banks are in a different position from those which are incorporated and headquartered in this country.   It is not the same legal situation.  We have to cater for and be sure of other considerations.

This situation arose in very extraordinary circumstances. Decisions had to be taken and legislation was brought before the House. The Minister for Finance was as expansive as he could be in explaining the reasoning behind it and what we were trying to achieve. The legislation allowed people to discuss how this would work in practice. The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer came forward with his response this morning. He stated that it would take him some time to provide his Parliament with all the necessary details. This is not a simple area.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Let us be fair. People are entitled to information and I will give as much as possible, but we also have to be fair to each other, make sure we get this right and take into account all the issues concerned. If the EU says that we need to avoid the distortion in the capital flows which it believes could possibly emerge or that we should deal with other banking institutions in the country in what it would claim to be a non-discriminatory manner, we are working through those issues with some of the parties in this country who may have an interest but who may not subsequently apply. Danske-Northern Ireland Bank has indicated that the Danish guarantee for Danske bank is sufficient as far as it is concerned. It will get on with its business and is probably unlikely to apply under our bank guarantee scheme. People are taking different views depending on the situations that arise. Denmark gave its guarantee in recent days.Issues are arising and it is not a static situation in which we go off, deal with the matter and bring it back here quickly. We need to make sure that we take account of what is a moving situation. What happened this morning across the water was a very significant initiative and we have to make sure our people consider the implications of that and advise the Government accordingly. These are important points.Of course it is important that we progress this as quickly as practicable. It is not my intention to foster uncertainty. We are clear in our objectives and we have stated them clearly. Arising from the debate in this House, a request was made for modifications and expansion of the scheme in certain respects. We are considering that and are speaking with the people concerned and the Europeans, who have views on the matter. We want to ensure that whatever we do will withstand rigorous scrutiny from any source so that this matter is sorted the way we want it sorted.  I do not suggest for a moment that this decision on its own addresses the entire situation — of course it does not — but it provides for the immediate stabilisation and access to liquidity that we need to proceed in a way that is not regarded by others as hostile.  That is what we are trying to achieve and the initial reaction of the markets has been helpful.  We brought in the legislation last week and we had a very expansive debate on it.  As Deputy Gilmore suggested, to accommodate debate we delayed our deliberations after concluding Second Stage and spent an entire day on Committee Stage.  We did all that, we then sent the Bill to the Seanad, which did its work.We are now in the process of dealing with this detailed scheme.  We outlined during the course of the discussions on the legislation what in essence we are trying to put in place.  We are now discussing the detail of that, based on continuing advice from the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance, taking into account the developments taking place in other countries and what the European Union institutions have to say about it.  Let us be fair, honest and straight about this.  We are proceeding cautiously, prudently, I hope, and comprehensively so that we can come to this House with confirmation that what is put to the House will cover the questions Members are entitled to ask, such as where this stands in regard to European Union arrangements and what view the Directorate General for Competition takes.  We need to make sure we can answer these questions and the only way we can do so is through an ongoing consultative process, which is taking place and which cannot be turned around overnight or in a matter of hours when dealing with these institutions.  That is the position.  We should accept that we will be able to come here with fewer questions to answer on the basis we have covered all the angles and bases.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	151	On the same issue, the net point is that as a State we have effectively given an unlimited guarantee with regard to a series of classes of debt, as outlined this morning by the leader of the Labour Party, some of it risky.  At the weekend the Government was to a degree celebrating the fact that the Irish arrangement had resulted in massive inflows into the banks benefiting from the guarantee.  What are the dimensions of the scheme?  Is it an absolutely unlimited guarantee?  This is why we want a briefing on the scheme and its framework.  Until the framework of the scheme is available to us, even if the finer detail has not been totally worked out, we do not know what we are guaranteeing.We are also moving towards the budget.  The Taoiseach mentioned Denmark which is charging up to €5 billion per year, plus an equity stake, for what it is doing for its banks.  We have had no indication of the budgetary arithmetic.  Has the Government factored in an income from the scheme, as we were assured there would be?  This morning we heard Deputy Kenny talk about cuts in the health service.  We need to know the framework of the scheme.  Has the Attorney General advised that there is a clear impediment in European law with regard to the framing of the guarantee and the additional institutions which have now applied to be included in the scheme?  I referred to this in my contribution last week as a potential Pandora's box.  Will the Taoiseach tell us what Pandora's box is now turning out to be?  What has the Attorney General advised in this regard?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	152	It is not helpful to refer to this as a Pandora's box; nor is it accurate.  It is not a question of an impediment.  There is a question from the European Union about what it regards as the possible discriminatory nature of a scheme provided for just the banks incorporated or regulated in one state.  We must deal with this issue.  We are engaging constructively with the European Union.  The competition Commissioner has been constructive and co-operative in this regard.  We are working through the issues involved, as the Opposition expects us to do.  It is not a question of there being an impediment but of how we can ensure the scheme meets the requirements of the European Union competition directorate, while at the same time leaving us in a position to consider any applications sympathetically and in a way that will not provide an inordinate risk for the State.  From the European Union point of view, we must make sure we are compliant with EU competition law and from our point of view, if we are to make arrangements with institutions other than those in our own jurisdiction, we must make sure we are covered and that we can ring-fence their Irish operations.  The assets and liabilities must be ring-fenced and we must know what we are taking on in the same way as we know what we are taking on with Irish banks which are not part of a wider group incorporated somewhere else.  How can we make sure, for all the reasons Deputies expect, that it is the authentic Irish operation with which we are dealing, not flows coming in and out from within the group, inter-company debts and all the rest?

We are having constructive discussions with the parties I mentioned.  We are sitting down with them and seeking clarification.  They are going back to their people and coming back to ours.  That is what one would expect — that it be done in a diligent, proper and rigorous way.  It is a different situation.  We are genuinely making efforts to be more inclusive, but we are also trying to make sure we know exactly what we will be dealing with.  These are important matters.  If it takes some time to get it right, let us get it right.  That is what Deputies expect us to do.

I welcome that announcement.  When will this legislation be introduced?  Given that local elections are scheduled for June next year, will the Government consider adding another part to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill before the House to provide for a cap on expenditure in local elections?What arrangements will be made to debate the report of the Morris tribunal in the House?  Does the Ceann Comhairle intend to convene a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider the enormous implications of the report for Members of the House?  My party and I fully stand over and support the actions taken by our colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and former Deputy Jim Higgins and the way in which they handled the information provided for them.  The implications of the report are very serious for every Member of the House.  Many of us come into possession of information on matters such as child abuse or other problems.  The idea that an individual Member of the House would have to conduct some kind of private investigation into material brought before him or her has serious implications for all of us.  I ask that an early meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be convened to consider the matter and the implications of the report for all Members of the House.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I thank the commission for its hard work and for the fair and equitable conclusion it has reached within the geographical constraints.  On the law of averages this will mean some discontent at the end of the process.  One journalist suggested, tongue in cheek, that there was much to be said for the days when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government took a pen to the State's map and lovingly gerrymandered a new set of constituencies.  The journalist hastily restored his tongue to its normal place, however, and said that obviously no one wanted to go back to the days of the "Tullymander".  This, as we all know, was a time when artistic talents were given free rein.The main areas of discontent include the transfer of parts of County Offaly into Tipperary North, the creation of the new Kerry North-West Limerick constituency and the continued division of my neighbouring County Leitrim.  Transparency is the essence of democracy and I agree with previous speakers who spoke on this Bill and felt it would be beneficial to hold a public meeting after the commission had issued its preliminary report to allow voters to contribute their views to the process.  This could serve to resolve the widespread apprehension, particularly in counties such as Leitrim and Offaly and in parts of Limerick and Kerry.  I particularly welcome the provision for a new constituency review to immediately follow publication of the next preliminary census figures in summer 2011, rather than waiting for the final report the following April.  If, as now seems unlikely, a general election will not take place before 2012, the next election could see totally revamped constituencies.As regards my constituency, Longford-Westmeath, I am delighted the commission saw fit to retain the status quo.  The constituency was restored by the previous commission to rectify what was seen to be an unsustainable realignment.  This is an historical constituency in the midlands and remains a four-seater, with the continued representation of four Deputies, although there is a sufficient population for a five-seater, given the section of Westmeath that has been brought back from the Meath West constituency.  A five-seater constituency in Longford-Westmeath would make sense, although I have no worries in that regard.  I work hard on behalf of my constituents and have nothing to fear.  However, the population would justify a five-seater constituency.Certainly, there was discontent in the midlands when the historical bond between the counties of Longford and Westmeath was broken.  An apparently arbitrary decision saw Longford realigned with Roscommon, which not only broke the historical bond, but geographical boundaries.  It made no sense whatsoever, because there were only two connections between Longford and Roscommon, as there still are.  The River Shannon divides the counties, and two bridges link the two counties.  That particular set-up did not make much sense and I am glad it was rectified.  From what Deputy Mary O'Rourke, my constituency colleague, said in her contribution, it appears the commission need not have set parameters at all, as she is happy to cross constituency boundaries, apparently in the spirit of the whole of Ireland being her constituency, taking on the work of every other public representative by default, regardless of whether they like it, or whether there is time left for the people she is supposed to represent.As regards the European Parliament, the commission has recommended that Longford-Westmeath be moved from the East constituency to that of North-East.  As a Deputy who takes pride in our heritage and culture, I believe that in naming the EU constituencies we should not have lost touch with the old historical identity of the provinces, which pre-dates the counties.  I feel strongly that we should, in some way, have retained the connection with the provinces and I regret the commission did not see fit to name the constituencies, where possible, after them.  With this transfer of the counties of Longford and Westmeath, variants of the East and North-East constituencies are closely aligned.  Both are three-seat constituencies.  The change will result in the loss of one MEP.It is essential that the democratic process is seen to be impartial and transparent, which brings me to the important matter of the electoral system.  We discussed this earlier with the Minister, as regards the electoral register and the urgent need to set up the electoral commission to sort out the appalling and indeed, frightening, inadequacies of the register, which meant people were unable to exercise their democrat right to vote.  Belated attempts by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to update and reform the register before the 2007 general election woefully failed.  Some €12 million of taxpayers' money was blatantly squandered and 1,500 field workers visited 1.25 million households, but there was still widespread chaos on polling day, with potential voters often having to face insurmountable difficulties.  We all witnessed this in our constituencies throughout the country during the general election last year.  People were being added to or subtracted from the register on apparent whims, with many receiving letters to inform them their names are being removed.  In my constituency the numbers on the register far exceeded the population figures.   The adult population of Longford at the time was 24,810, yet the draft register contains 27,132 names, a difference of 2,322 or 9%.  Westmeath has an adult population of 57,141, with 59,791 names on the draft register, a differential of 2,650 or 5%.  As the maintenance of the electoral register was never intended to be a function of local authorities, given the urgent need for a rolling register, updated on a continuous basis, it is essential that an independent commission or office be established with its own job specific staff.  A delegation from the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government visited Northern Ireland and met Dr. Douglas Bain.  We witnessed an example of how the system should work.  Dr. Bain informed us the system had an accuracy rate in the high 90s.  This model should be followed in the Republic and was recommended in the report of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Such a national body has been highly effective in Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions.I very much support the establishment of an electoral commission with total responsibility for the maintenance of the electoral register.  I entered local government in 1985 and, election after election, have encountered problems.  It is time for us to face up to the problems encountered during the years and address them to the satisfaction not alone of public representatives but the electorate generally.  I hope the Minister will take my comments on board.

My constituency will increase from a three-seater to a four-seater, which is positive for me, but the difficulty is that the county town of Swords has been split down its main street.  Similarly, the village of Clonsilla has been more or less split down the middle for the local authority elections.  I appreciate people do not live in settlements of 25,000 and that if they did, it would be very convenient.  The boundary must be drawn somewhere and someone will end up on the wrong side of it.  The Taoiseach suggested the House could dissect the report but that should not happen.  It was drafted independently and we must accept it, for better or worse.I do not agree with Deputy Finian McGrath who suggested yesterday the number of Members should be increased on the basis of the increase in the population.  The Dáil is probably one of the few areas in the public service where numbers have not increased.  The population to TD ratio has increased considerably, which is positive.  It would send a bad message to the people if the size of the Parliament was increased at a time when the rest of the public service is being asked to downsize.  When Germany experienced a financial crisis seven or eight years ago, the membership of its parliament was reduced and that helped to give leadership regarding other reforms to be introduced.I refer to the increasing imbalance in representation in various local authority areas.  For example, there is one councillor per 10,000 people in Fingal County Council.  The figures are similar in Dublin city, Cork county and city.  We have three or four Deputies and nine councillors in Fingal, whereas other parts of the country are represented by five Deputies and 60 councillors.  The Minister has the power under the Local Government Act 2003 to vary the size of local authorities.  While he cannot make such a change before next year's elections, I ask him to examine this issue during his term to ascertain which local authorities need to increase or decrease in terms of representation.  It is a very difficult for one councillor to represent 10,000 people, given that he or she receives the same allowances as those who represent far fewer people.I agree with the introduction of spending limits for local government elections.  At yesterday's committee meeting the suggestion was that the limit should apply for three months prior to election date.  That probably makes sense but it must be recognised it should not only be based on the number of seats in the ward.  The spending limits for Dáil elections are based on the number of seats and candidates per constituency.  However, for example, Mulhuddart has a population of almost 50,000 in 20,000 households.  The spending limit in that five-seat ward should be different from that for a five-seater in a county with a population of 10,000 and 3,000 households.  When the Minister and his officials devise the scheme, the spending limit should be based on the population of the electoral area rather than the number of seats.  If the spending limit is €20,000 in an area with a population of 50,000, that equates to spending 40 cent per voter over three months.  One cannot do much for that amount.  One could not deliver a leaflet to every household or erect sufficient posters.  Will the Minister link the local election spending limits with the population of the ward and not the number of seats?I am unhappy with the process for making boundary changes.  Deputy Burton drew attention to the different way this is done in the United Kingdom where the Electoral Commission publishes a proposed set of new boundaries.  People then examine and respond to them before they are reviewed and adopted.

Responses were provided and changes were then introduced.  That might be a better system for the next constituency review.  We have plenty of time to do this, as the next census will not take place until 2011.  Perhaps a new system could be adopted then, whereby draft boundaries would be published and discussed before a final decision was taken rather than being presented with a  fait accompli, which is more or less what we have now.There are two Green Party Ministers in the Cabinet, one of whom has an appetite for media, while the other, Deputy Gormley, has an appetite for reform.  Perhaps he will examine the wider issue of electoral reform during his tenure.  The issue has been much discussed but very little has been done about it.  Fianna Fáil tried to introduce a first past the post system on two occasions, which I do not favour, but there may well be a case for the introduction of a mixed system similar to that used in Scotland, Wales and Germany, where members are elected on a regional and local basis.  That ensures small parties are represented and a mix of people are engaged in constituency or legislative work.  In Germany members of the Bundestag who are elected to constituency seats command more respect than those elected under the list system because they are considered to have been elected in their own right.  I do not accept the view that there should be a division between members engaged in constituency work and legislators.  That does not happen in countries that have adopted a mixed electoral system.  High profile Ministers and legislators are expected to win seats locally.I agree with Deputy Bannon regarding the naming of European constituencies such as Ireland East and Ireland South, which do not mean very much to people.  It is difficult to name the constituency in the west because it stretches across all four provinces.  It begins in County Westmeath, a 45 minute drive from my house, which is extraordinary.  I doubt many of my constituents know the boundaries of Dublin West.  Journalists do not because I am often described as a Member for Dublin North-West or Dublin Mid-West.   Were it to use local names and be called Dublin Blanchardstown-Castleknock, for example, people would be better able to identify where they live.Given that the Castleknock electoral area comprises the Blanchardstown shopping centre, Blanchardstown hospital and Blanchardstown village, should it not be called Castleknock-Blanchardstown?  Similarly, the largest and second largest settlements in Mulhuddart are Clonsilla and Clonee, respectively, but it has an odd name.  I made this argument in my submission to the commission, but it does not seem to have been picked up.  No one ever says that he or she is from Pembroke, rather, he or she is from Ballsbridge, Donnybrook or Dublin 4.  No one says he or she is from Glencullen, rather, he or she is from Sandyford or Ballinteer.  Given these facts, why do we not use relevant names for electoral areas?I referred to local government spending limits, but another point is the dual mandate.  While I may be wrong, one cannot be a Member of the Dáil and a member of a council, but it is still possible to be a member of the council and a Member of the European Parliament.  If this is the case, it is odd.  It is also odd that people, including someone in my constituency, will run for a council and the European Parliament on the same day.  What would happen if people were elected to councils and the Parliament on the same day?  How would they choose which position to take up?

We know who will be on the B panel for the Parliament elections, but not for the local council elections.  If someone in my constituency runs in the local and European elections simultaneously, I assume he or she would take the parliamentary position were he or she to win it, at which point the council seat would be handed to someone else.  Running for two parliaments on the same day, picking and choosing and dumping someone into the open position would be deceptive.I take great interest in examining the marked register often as I am always fascinated to see how many people do not vote.  Approximately 40% of people who attend my clinics do not vote.  I am always interested to see whether family members, friends of families, party members and their families vote.  Examining the marked register is a fascinating exercise, but we are not allowed to access it in respect of referenda.  We should have access.  Many talking heads and celebrities had a lot to say about the Lisbon treaty, but I would be interested in knowing whether any of them voted.  I suspect that some did not.  As this is the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, it would be possible to introduce an amendment along these lines.  The marked register is an important way to ensure that there is no fraud.  It is easier to commit fraud in a referendum because no one gets to find out who voted.My final point is on electoral reform.  As a Member of this Parliament, I am shocked by how few Members are women.  I am delighted that three women and four men are present in the Chamber, but it is an unusual and unrepresentative ratio.  I grew up in a house of women, although my father is obviously a man.  I attended mixed primary and secondary schools.  I studied medicine at Trinity College in a class 70% of which was made up of women.  Women comprise 40% of my party's members and more than one third of a council of which I was a member consisted of women.  Then I came to Dáil Éireann and, for the first time, joined a men's club.  I felt that I was at a meeting of the Order of the Knights of St. Columbanus or the Masons.This issue must be addressed as the Parliament cannot continue to represent 50% of the population so poorly.

As a profession, politics is probably unattractive to women.  For example, I do not know how one would take maternity leave.  It might be impossible.  Former Deputy Mildred Fox stated that she did not mind a day's work, but having to go back out again after going home was the difficult part.  Is there a way to address this issue?

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I welcome Deputy Varadkar's acknowledgement of the reforming nature of the Minister and the legislation.  It is important to remember that this country has not always had fair and unbiased electoral boundary revisions, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s when constituency boundary revisions that were not without controversy over their lack of fairness were passed by many Ministers.  I welcome the fact that we have a much more transparent and trustworthy system, particularly given that boundary revision is done by an independent panel at times determined by demographic change rather than political expediency.Section 9 provides for the establishment of constituency commissions, upon the publication by the Central Statistics Office of preliminary census figures, and for the report of the commission to be completed not later than three months after the publication of the final census figures.  The latter is an important provision.  As many Deputies will remember, a complex and important case was heard in the High Court last year in which several plaintiffs claimed that the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2005 was inconsistent with the Constitution.  While Mr. Justice Clarke, in his verdict, claimed that the Act was not inconsistent with the Constitution, he stated that he believed the obligations on the Oireachtas regarding its constitutional duties to provide for equal representation "calls for a consideration of whether measures can be put in place to minimise the gap between the availability of census figures and the enactment of legislation".  It was an important point.While six months may have been deemed a sufficient lapse between final census figures and the final report of a constituency commission until now, the three-month deadline proposed by the Bill is a sensible reform.  The provision for the establishment of a constituency commission as soon as provisional census figures are published is sensible.The progress made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in establishing an electoral commission and in local government reform will have a dynamic effect on how we run all our elections.  The commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to establish an electoral commission that will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight, implementing modern and efficient electoral practices, revising constituency boundaries, taking over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission relating to election spending and the examination of the issue of financing the political system is a substantial and significant undertaking.  The process of revising the electoral rules, administering the electoral process and upholding standards in the way parties compete at elections is something that should not be subject to the ideology or whim of any particular Government.The shift to fair and free elections is one we trust.  Sharpening up how we do our business is good for democracy.  The Minister's comments yesterday and previously on the cap on spending in local elections should also be welcomed, particularly by a party such as ours, which does not take corporate donations, an aspect of political culture that has for far too long been tainted by suspicion and undue influence from those with much money.  There have been murmurings of "buying elections" with extravagant and lavish spending.  We all hear stories of how certain candidates with wads of money can out-spend, out-gun and out-manoeuvre a candidate of the same calibre but without the same means in his or her pocket.  Capping the spend on local elections would be welcome.The electoral register must be part of current electoral reform.  Those of us who have taken the local authority route know the stories of small three-bedroom houses with ten or 12 people registered there before an election.  They are legion.  Getting the fundamentals right is important.  Simple measures can be put in place to ensure that the register works and is accurate.  The Minister's proposals for a rolling electoral register are welcome.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	305	One aspect of reform that could be explored in establishing an electoral commission is the possibility, as outlined in recent political science literature, of permanent political boundaries for constituencies, with only the number of Deputies or councillors changing with shifting demographics.  We in Carlow-Kilkenny are slightly confused because some parts of County Carlow are in County Wicklow for a general election and some parts of County Laois go into County Carlow, although we get them back for local elections.It is not often that a Carlow local authority stars in a murder story, but Carlow stars in the last Inspector Morse novel written by Ted Dexter.  In it, the ever gloomy Morse says to his sidekick, Lewis:"Do you know why Carlow County Council did not get a reply from that guy?""No," says Lewis."Well," says Morse, "he's been dead for a while."Ergo, we must keep the register up to date and Carlow serves as a reminder in that thriller.  I welcome this Bill and I want the legislation to be progressed as speedily as possible.  In an open, working democracy, this is good for Ireland, good for electoral reform and good for our constituencies.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I am pleased to speak on this matter.  One issue relevant to the matter of constituencies is the breaching of county boundaries.  My constituency traverses Sligo and north Leitrim.  Many people in Leitrim would prefer that the county was treated as one single constituency.  They believe the county's interests as a whole would be better served as one entity.  Whether this is true, it is a belief many people in the county hold.The Electoral Act 1997 states that "the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable".  The issue of place and identity is something that is very important in Irish society.  We see it every year in the GAA when people go in their thousands to support their counties.  I understand the commission was impartial when drawing up the report, but that does not mean it is a perfect document or that the result is correct.In my constituency some changes have been recommended.  The 2003-2004 commission recommended, and the Oireachtas enacted, the establishment of the two three-seat constituencies of Roscommon-South Leitrim and Sligo-North Leitrim.  The largest number of submissions on one issue received by the commission related to including all of County Leitrim in one constituency.  These submissions were in the form both of direct requests that a change be made to this effect and specific proposals as to how this might be achieved.  The arguments advanced in these submissions centred on the issue of ensuring that a representative from County Leitrim is elected to the Dáil.The commission considered carefully each of the submissions relating to County Leitrim and was very much aware of the strength of feeling expressed on the issue.  It also considered carefully all of the available options of including the county in one constituency.  This included the proposals advanced in this regard in the submissions.  The commission deemed that it was not possible to identify an alternative to the current arrangement of constituencies in the area that "both met the concerns advanced in the submissions and had no other undesirable impacts on the configuration of constituencies".The commission deemed that each of the alternatives considered had one or more significant disadvantages, including the breaching of another county boundary, the placing of three counties in one constituency, geographic difficulties and extensive loss of continuity, including large population movement in the arrangement of constituencies.  For these reasons, the commission recommended adherence to the general constituency configuration proposed in the report of the 2003-2004 commission and enacted by the Oireachtas.There are some changes.  The 2006 census records that the Sligo-North Leitrim constituency now has a variance of -7.53%.  With Roscommon-South Leitrim having a variance of +1.48%, it is deemed by the commission that the variance in Sligo-North Leitrim is capable of being dealt with in that context.  The commission deems that in the north of the existing Roscommon-South Leitrim constituency, it is possible to move a number of electoral divisions with a population of 3,376 into Sligo-North Leitrim.  However, I do not agree.  Sligo-North Leitrim included the county of Sligo and one third of Leitrim but the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim included Roscommon and two thirds of Leitrim.  This gave Leitrim a half-decent chance of electing a Deputy within the county.  With the local elections approaching, I know this will cause some upheaval for constituents in the areas affected.  We must not forget that behind major reports such as this there are real people who are affected, the grassroots of democracy who will feel the effects of any proposed changes.One of the changes that has been floated is that Ballisadare will be included in the Enniscrone electoral area.  On the national stage this may not register but, as the saying goes, all politics is local.  We must never forget the small parishes and villages around the country that are at the heart of our democracy and will be affected by this report.  The Enniscrone electoral area is effectively a peninsula, surrounded by the sea to the north and west and the mountains to the south.  It was a three-seat local election constituency.  The Minister wanted to create four-seat constituencies but by changing that area, he has put a knife through other electoral areas.  This has had a serious effect, as in the case of Ballisadare, divided by a river, where the main street is in one electoral area and the rest of the town in another.  That is very unfair.Perhaps the commission should be made up of political parties, members of which have an understanding of and a feeling for what is happening and the conditions on the ground.  It is difficult to get everyone to agree on boundary changes because it will affect somebody somewhere.  The commission makes a decision, closes the book and no one is responsible.  We should try to move in the direction suggested.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I welcome the opportunity to contribute but I do not welcome the recommendations of the boundary commission.  One can argue that all politics is local.  While I am critical of the Constituency Commission, I am not questioning the independence and integrity of the people who sat on it.  However, they got it badly wrong in a number of constituencies, including Limerick.  Subsequent to the boundary changes, media reports in the Irish Independent referred to the winners and losers.  Naturally the article refers to Kerry being a winner: “Rather than losing a TD, the Kingdom takes a chunk of west Limerick and retains its six TDs for the next general election.”  The article refers to Limerick as a loser: “The county loses a TD and is turned into a dogs dinner of three constituencies.”  If there was a difficulty with Kerry in respect of under representation, I cannot understand why the commission felt it had to meddle in Limerick, taking a sizeable chunk of the constituency I represent and putting it into a new constituency to be called North Kerry-West Limerick.  It defies all logic and I cannot understand why that was done.Deputy Varadkar has made many outlandish statements in this House since he was elected but his contribution today was sensible.  His suggestion is the only obvious answer to this problem.  On the other hand, Deputy Hogan referred to the Taoiseach's confused judgment because he suggested, at the early stage of this issue, that we should ask the Constituency Commission to introduce an interim report that the House could examine.  If it were to throw up something as outlandish as what has occurred on this occasion, we would not allow it.In law, these recommendations need not be accepted by this Parliament but it has been a matter of course for the past number of years that all recommendations of the Constituency Commission have been accepted.  Deputy Hogan stated: "If we were to follow the Taoiseach's confused thinking on this subject, Members, as legislators, would be given the opportunity to change reports from the numerous commissions and so on, for example, on the health services."  That is not being considered for one moment but I feel strongly that the Constituency Commission can, with the stroke of a pen, take away my career.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	308	We know all about it.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	309	The Acting Chairman knows about this and other Members feel the same way.  We will never have all-party agreement on Constituency Commission recommendations because there are winners and losers.  I am not a sore loser.  I will fight my battle and take on the new challenge.  However, it is making my job extremely difficult.  I cannot see the logic in it but it has been done and we cannot change it.  On this occasion, no party has an appetite to change it but the only way to go is to ask the next boundary commission to produce an interim report.  This would solve two problems and I hope the Minister will provide clarification when he responds on Second Stage.Boundary recommendations will be put to this House in the coming days and they will become law and I accept this.  I have shifted my tent into the new part of my constituency to meet and work with and for my people.  At the back of my mind, I am aware that another census will take place in a few years and a boundary commission will be obliged by law to act after the census.  If we keep going the way we are, it is technically possible that the boundary of my constituency will be revised again and we will have confusion.I am open to contradiction but I understand that if we go down the route of asking the commission to implement an interim report, it would be produced after the census and prior to a general election if the Government sees out its full term.  This would provide us with an opportunity to examine the interim report, have the election and then make changes.  It is the only sensible way to progress and we must have clarification and certainty on it, not only for ourselves but for the people we represent.The people of west Limerick, who I have represented for the past number of years, feel sore that they are being asked to vote in another county.  They will never be in a position to elect one of their own, a Limerick man or woman, because the boundary revision distinctly favours candidates from the other county, namely, Kerry.  This adds insult to injury.  They have been disenfranchised.  They have a loyalty to their county and they should be entitled to vote for candidates in their county and have their own constituency as they always had.  It is not good enough.  I cannot undo what has been done but I feel strongly about it and I am cross that these people should be treated in such a manner.With respect to the boundary commission, I understood it would respect within reason county and provincial boundaries and this has not happened on this occasion.  County boundaries have been broken and towns have been divided in two.  This makes no logical sense to me.  A portion of Deputy Enright's constituency in Leinster has been lost to north Tipperary in Munster and this is wrong.We must have pride in our profession and if we do not defend it nobody else will.  We have come to the stage when we should decide.  We should have an independent boundary commission by all means but I would add a political brain to those independent people, perhaps former Ministers or Deputies from all sides of the House.  They would have a feel for politics and an understanding of how it works.I respect the position, integrity and independence of the people on the commission and we must keep it independent.  However, we must also be sensible.  None of us should allow our careers to be taken from under us with a stroke of a pen.  The people of Kerry must have lobbied effectively as they managed to save their seat when the constituency was under-represented.  I understand the people of Leitrim made more submissions than any other constituency in the country because of the wrong done to them on a previous occasion.  However, the boundary there was not changed back.I appeal to all parties that the only route we can take is to have the boundary commission produce an interim report to be examined sensibly in this House.  I do not mean that we should only introduce minor changes or tinker with the edges, which happens and must happen.  In future, I will not accept decisions such as those proposed on this occasion.  If I am fortunate enough to be in the House on the next occasion I will vote in a different way.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The Electoral Amendment Bill 2008 provides for the revision of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Constituency Commission which was presented to the Ceann Comhairle in October 2007.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of future constituency commissions on publication by the CSO of the preliminary results in respect of a census of population and for the work of the commission to be completed following publication of final population data relating to the relevant census.As well as dealing with constituency revision, the Bill proposes alternative procedures such as deposits or assents by electors for nomination of non-party candidates at European Parliament and local elections.  The Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2007 provided for such alternative procedures for non-party candidates at Dáil elections.  The need for these arose from a judgment of the Supreme Court in 2006 in which the court upheld the main requirement for obtaining 30 assenters to a Dáil nomination but struck down the provision requiring personal attendance by all assenters at a single location in a constituency.  The court found the provision was inappropriate to the objective to be achieved and unconstitutional.Due to the limited time then available and the need for enactment and implementation prior to the 2007 general election, the text of the 2007 Act provided for alternative nomination procedures for non-party candidates at Dáil elections only.  Corresponding procedures for European Parliament and local elections are now required in advance of these elections next year and are included in the Bill on this basis.  The procedures follow those enacted in 2007 for Dáil elections.The overall aim of the Bill is to modernise and update the electoral law.  The specific objectives of the Bill are to revise Dáil and European Parliament constituencies and to provide for the number of members to be elected for such constituencies in accordance with the report of the Constituency Commission.With regard to revising Dáil constituencies, I am happy to state as a sitting T.D. for the constituency of Longford-Westmeath that our constituency has been left the same as it was at the previous general election.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the constituency on behalf of the people in Longford and Westmeath.  This was a sensible recommendation.  We have been together for many years, although temporarily separated.  The people of these adjacent counties have a great deal in common.  We have worked well together in the past.The regional hospital in Mullingar, County Westmeath, serves the people of Longford and Westmeath.  It is of utmost importance for the public representatives and those we represent that we have a hospital in our area and access to it and the personnel, management, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children to ensure a proper service is maintained at the hospital in Mullingar.  I must compliment everyone at the hospital on the great work they do.  I have visited the hospital many times and people are inclined to underestimate the commitment, dedication and work of the hospital staff, including the professors, consultants, doctors, nurses, ward staff and everyone who works there.  Seeing is believing and I do not receive any complaints from patients who have been admitted and treated in the hospital.  I have heard nothing but the height of praise for the excellent service people receive from the staff.  It is refreshing and rewarding for someone like me to meet the people in the hospital whom patients meet on a regular basis to see how committed and dedicated they are to improving both the service and the health of those for whom they care.The people of Longford-Westmeath have many other things in common.  We also were part of the Midland Regional Authority, on which we worked together very well.  In addition, people in Longford-Westmeath look forward to extending a dual carriageway connecting Longford with Mullingar to continue the magnificent road that runs from Kinnegad to Dublin.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I thank Deputy Higgins for welcoming us to the North-West constituency.  We will take up his invitation to do the best we can.  We will feel welcome in Galway and if at all possible, when Deputy Higgins votes, he should not forget Fianna Fáil and should try to elect one or two Fianna Fáil candidates for the North-West constituency.  That would be good of him.  As for the changes to the European constituencies, Longford is close to Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and Connacht in general, as well as to Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Clare and Galway.  Consequently, in a European context, Longford is in the right constituency this time, namely, the North-West constituency.I am sure that many will put their names forward to contest the European elections.  This is highly important; people now realise the importance of being part of the European Union.  If one travels the world and visits Asia, Africa or anywhere else outside of Europe, even perhaps in North America, people will ask where one is from.  If one replies that one is from Ireland, the response will be that as Ireland is part of the European Union, one really is from Europe.  Such people focus on European policy and trade.  Europe has a huge population that constitutes an enormous market for the rest of the world's exports.I look forward to the European elections and note that the European Union has served us well.  However, we also have served it well and played our part as true visionaries.  I refer to people who preceded me such as Jack Lynch who did Ireland a great service in 1972 by signing Ireland's accession treaty with the European Union to take effect in 1973.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, did us proud in the last European Parliament when Ireland held the Presidency of the European Union.  It was well known and widely thought that during its six months' Presidency, the Irish Government was equal to, if not better than, any other government which held the Presidency in the history of the European Union.Having spoken of the Dáil and the European Parliament, I wish to say a few words about county council electoral areas in County Longford.  There has been a slight revision involving a change in population from one area to another.  Overall, I welcome the revision in County Longford which has some excellent county councillors on a 21-member county council.  The Drumlish electoral area in north Longford has been changed slightly.  I started out in the mid-Longford area in 1985, part of which, around Newtownforbes, has been transferred to the Drumlish area.  The other areas in County Longford are Ballymahon in south Longford and the Ballinalee-Granard area.  Overall, I am looking forward to the local elections in Longford in June.  It will be a great opportunity for everyone to get out and about to meet the people and I look forward to success for all candidates.On the subject of local elections, I take the opportunity to compliment and congratulate the director of services and staff at Longford County Council who maintain the register of electors.  All politics is local, as has been stated in the House many times, and Members should appeal to everyone to register.  In fairness to the director of services and staff of Longford County Council at Great Water Street, Longford, anyone who wishes to contact them whenever the office is open will experience nothing but courtesy and efficiency.  If people apply to the office in time, their queries will be answered.  Moreover, the office in Longford County Council remains open to deal with queries from electors from the minute polling stations open in the morning until their closure in the evening.  I apologise to people for not being aware of this until after the last election.  It was found in isolated cases that people had arrived at the polling stations who were not on the register for some reason.  However, those who contacted the office enabled it to check the matter and acknowledge they should have been on the register.  People did not realise there was this facility.  It is a great facility to have because those who go to the polling station only to discover they are not on the register become highly annoyed, upset and frustrated because it is one's democratic right to vote.  Such persons feel unjustly deprived.  Perhaps Members should take the opportunity to appeal to the people that if they are in any doubt about being on the register, they should check it out.  They should get in touch with their local county council and simply ask whether they are on the register by sending an e-mail, dropping a note, making a telephone call or visiting the relevant office.  With the local elections coming up, one realises how it has been disappointing for people over the years when they find some family members go to vote and are not on the register.  The first action one should take when heading for an election is to ensure the people being asked to vote can do so.  We would like to see everyone able to vote.The Bill is to amend the law relating to the constituency revision process, having regard to the implications of the High Court judgment arising from the Murphy and McGrath cases.  It is also to provide an alternative statutory mechanism to regulate the nomination of non-party candidates, as I said, at European and local elections.A Constituency Commission was established under the Electoral Act 1997 on 26 April 2007 to make a report relating to constituencies for the election of Members to Dáil Éireann and MEPs to the European Parliament.  I do not know if sympathy is the right word but we have a feeling for people living in counties which have been divided.  For local elections, some feel parishes should not be divided.  Perhaps parishes should not be divided and they should use the GAA model where a person can only play for a team in one's own parish and people living outside that parish are expected to play for the other parish's team.  There is a great bond, love and commitment from the people to the place of their birth, where they were reared and where they live and work.  It is where their mother, father and grandparents came from, and people like to be part and parcel of it.  Sometimes a parish is divided and people in one parish would have to vote for a person in another.I know population is the basis for this division but maybe we can even it out as best we can.  As the previous speaker indicated, perhaps every county in Ireland should have the opportunity to elect somebody from that county or who resides there.We also wish to provide for the numbers to be elected in accordance with the report.  Since independent constituency commissions were initiated in 1979, it is established practice that the Government accepts the recommendations in the report.  This Bill provides accordingly and the final determination of constituencies is a matter for the Oireachtas to prescribe in legislation.  Options relating to constituency formation are a matter for the commission.There will be no significant costs or impacts as a result of implementing the commission's report.  All Ministers were consulted in advance of the Bill's publication and submissions in the Constituency Commission are dealt with under section 2.4 on page 9 of the report.With regard to my constituency, I welcome this Bill and look forward to supporting it.  There is a recommendation that the number of Deputies remains the same, with one public representative per 30,000 people for the Dáil.  I thank the Acting Chairman and Deputy Michael D. Higgins for welcoming me to the new constituency.  I thank Deputy Enright for having the patience to listen for the past 20 minutes.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I will begin as I know the debate will adjourn at 1.30 p.m.  We all effectively outlined our views on this Bill some time ago in early summer, and we have had a debate on the report of the Constituency Commission.  The legislation was not discussed in detail at that point but listening to some of the speakers today, we are effectively making the same speeches.  Despite that round of statements in the Chamber a few months back, there were no changes and we are coming back to speak on the exact same issue.I queried at the time why we were having such statements when legislation was forthcoming.  It probably had more to do with the fact that the Dáil fell on three separate occasions prior to the summer because of a lack of business than any real consensus-building exercise, although it may have been painted as such.Like some speakers, I have a vested interest in this — that may be the best way to put it.  My loss could be the gain of the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Hoctor, or more likely that of Deputy Coonan.  I will speak later on the south Offaly area in particular.The decision of the Constituency Commission — one may call it wisdom — has caused a great degree of anger and confusion.  It has added unnecessary complication to the electoral process in some of the affected areas.  It was interesting to hear Deputy Kelly discuss the Midland Regional Authority, which he and I were members of at the same time.  For example, all the people of Offaly are represented on the Midland Regional Authority but there will be no representation from the people of north Tipperary.  The two constituencies will now be intermingled.Similarly, representatives on the Midland Regional Authority from the proposed constituency of Longford-Westmeath may have issues.  Much of the work of the Midland Regional Authority relates directly to Europe and it has representatives such as Councillor Constance Hanniffy on the committee of the regions and so on.  The authority has now effectively been put into two separate European constituencies by the Constituency Commission report.That leads to much complication and confusion, particularly when people feel the need to lobby Deputies for this House and MEPs for the European Parliament.  There is immediately a great increase in the number of people who need to be in discussions, which does not always lead to fruitful discussion.One aspect which annoyed me most was that when we had the debate in the summer, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, stated that the changes to Laois-Offaly are relatively minor.  I am sure he knows the history of the State as well as any of us but it is the first time the constituency has been changed and for the people of the area it is anything but minor.  It was a disappointing way to put it, although I presume it was the perceived Government view.  The Minister was clearly speaking as a representative for all parties in Government when he made his statement rather than just as a Green Party Deputy.  It certainly colours my view of the matter.It is important we remember and acknowledge that the commission is given its terms of reference by the Government, and the public should be aware of that.  That happened in this instance also, although it was not the current Government made up of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats.  The previous Government consisting of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats gave those terms of reference.If the terms of reference had been clearer, there would have been an opportunity to reduce some of the anomalies thrown up, but the commission was not given that opportunity.  Everybody must admit that the Constitution takes precedence and we must meet the requirements under it regarding the number of Deputies based on population in each area.  There has been an attempt to muddy the waters in that regard but it is important it is made clear that the commission is given terms of reference.  We will need to examine this in future and see how the commission's terms of reference need to be changed.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The capital expenditure allocation to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in 2008 was €276.87 million.  In addition, there was a deferred surrender amount of €25.181 million which was carried over from 2007, giving a total of €302.051 million available to the Department in 2008.In July 2008, some €3.9 million of the capital allocation was surrendered as part of savings required by the Government.  These savings are being made in the programmes for cultural projects and in the allocation to Fáilte Ireland in respect of tourism product development.  The net result of these changes is to reduce the 2008 capital allocation to €272.97 million in addition to the deferred surrender amount, giving a total of €298.151 million for 2008.This amount, which includes the capital carryover from 2007, is distributed among the various programmes as follows: €116 million to the Lansdowne Road stadium project; €58 million in respect of grants to sporting organisations and the provision of sports and recreational facilities; €37 million to cultural infrastructure; €20 million for grants under the local authority swimming pool programme; €20 million to the Irish Film Board; €16 million to Fáilte Ireland, of which €15 million is in respect of tourism product development; €4 million to the national sports campus; €8 million to Horse Racing Ireland; €2 million to Bord na gCon; €5 million to the Arts Council; €5 million to the National Museum; €2 million to the National Library; and €4 million for a range of programme areas, including the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Chester Beatty Library, National Concert Hall, Crawford Art Gallery, National Archives and dormant accounts funding to support sport in disadvantaged areas.At the end of September 2008, a total of €192.32 million had been expended.  This amounts to 65% of the revised allocation for 2008.  I expect the entire 2008 capital budget to be expended by the year end.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	327	It is difficult to digest all the figures provided.  With only €192 million of the Department's annual capital budget expended so far, does the Minister expect the entire amount to be spent by the end of the year?  Will all the promised projects be completed, particularly in respect of cultural institutions?  I am anxious that capital expenditure is maintained this year and next year because every year it appears that part of the annual allocation is pushed into the following year's allocation.  While this gives the appearance that substantial sums are being expended, only a fraction of the annual allocation is spent.As the Minister will agree, maintaining current levels of capital expenditure is particularly important for economic reasons, notably, to support employment in the construction industry and avail of the excess capacity and cheaper prices which will be available in the sector.  The primary reason for maintaining capital expenditure is to ensure we invest in the cultural institutions to support the arts and tourism.I am particularly concerned that we are falling behind in the area of cultural institutions, many of which are at risk.  The National Library's book collection is being held in what is effectively a fire hazard.  The National Archives is located in a biscuit factory, while the museum artefacts in the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Museum are at risk of being lost or destroyed as a result of the failure to spend the funds allocated.  Will the Minister give an assurance that capital expenditure will be spent and building projects will proceed, particularly in the case of our cultural institutions where the works are badly needed to maintain and preserve what we have as opposed to expand or improve facilities?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I do not agree that large chunks of the allocation are not being used every year.  The capital programme of the Department has expanded significantly in recent years and the full allocation has been expended.  The carryover, a relatively small sum, usually arises because the Department is waiting for invoices to be submitted before it can pay bills.  This occurs when projects are nearing completion and some of the organisations drawing down the money may not be in a position to finalise their business in time.  This is the reason for the small annual carryover.  My detailed reply listed capital allocations in all subheads, both large and small.Some of the programmes to which the Deputy alluded and in which issues have arisen are handled by the Office of Public Works.  While the Department and OPW work together to organise the capital programme, funding for some projects comes from the latter's budget.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	329	While I appreciate that much of the work is processed by the Office of Public Works, the OPW appears to be swamped and projects are falling behind schedule.  For example, the Natural History Museum has been closed for more than 18 months following the collapse of a set of stairs, an incident which placed people and not only artefacts at risk.  It does not make sense that there is still no sign of work starting on the building.  Is the Minister in a position to request that projects such as this where the facility is closed are prioritised?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Yes, it is possible for me to do so.  There is no conflict between the Department and the Office of Public Works, which have a good working relationship.  There is, however, competition for resources on all fronts.  A specific and complex problem, which goes beyond the initial incident when stairs collapsed, has arisen in the Natural History Museum.  The project in that case will be substantial and will be completed over the next few years.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The project was in planning prior to the collapse of the stairs.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Yes, it is in planning.  The Department has been in discussions to try to manage the opening of the facility in the foreseeable future.  That is the current position.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Work on the production of a national sports facilities strategy is at an advanced stage.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport in order that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sports and recreational facilities in Ireland.  Through the sports capital programme, the Government has allocated more than €725 million to more than 7,400 separate sports projects since 1998.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.The national sports facilities strategy, which will take account of research findings such as those referred to by the Deputy, will address future sports facility funding and provision and will inform future rounds of the sports capital programme.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	334	In tabling my question I had in mind a number of ESRI reports which suggest a shift in focus from capital to current expenditure.  I raise this issue against the background of the duplication of resources in certain areas, for example, in the case of clubs seeking to build club houses in areas which have an excellent sports facility.  When will the national audit of sports facilities to which the Minister alluded be completed?  This audit will provide a good indicator of areas in which there is duplication and gaps that need to be filled.I welcome the written answer I received from the Minister on a specific local issue I raised in a parliamentary question.  It referred to Lourdes Celtic FC, a very good soccer club which is working hard to provide a facility, particularly for younger people.  The club does not have a sports pavilion or toilet facilities and members are at their wits' end.  This is an example of a small local facility which badly needs an injection of funding at a time when major capital programmes are under way in areas where parallel facilities may be in place.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	335	The Deputy's comments reflect an ongoing and valid debate.  I hope the audit will be completed over the coming months.  The Irish Sports Council commissioned a number of reports from the ESRI and other agencies.  The findings of these reports will influence the direction the Department will take on these issues.Over the past ten years, sports facilities have been transformed throughout the country.  While solutions remain to be found in individual cases, in some instances the Department is not the only reason facilities have not been constructed.  I accept that, at a minimum, all sports facilities, for various obvious reasons, need to have proper dressing rooms and toilet facilities.  Many of these sports facilities are now for mixed use, which I welcome.  One of the issues that arose in the most recent report was the significant issue of ensuring the retention of young women in sport.  We are aware of the benefits from the point of view of health, socially and in other respects, gained by individuals who are active in sport.  That is an issue we are examining.  Perhaps it is time to pause and reflect on the number of sports facilities provided across every county not only in terms of the club or school but to maximise the use of those individual facilities during the day, night and at weekends to ensure that, on behalf of the taxpayer, we obtain the full value for a local community from all the investment that has been made.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	336	In regard to the county by county aspect of facilities, an interesting commentary in a report by John Considine of the department of economics, University College Cork, published recently, relates to the per capita allocation of the national lottery grant.  County Kerry had the highest per capita allocation in 2003-07.  I wonder if this is merely a coincidence.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I will, but I know from experience over the years and not only as the Minister responsible that all applications for sports grants go through a rigorous assessment which has nothing to do with the Minister responsible.  Unless they come through that process, they do not end up on the desk in terms of recommendations for allocations.  There is certainly no way in which a Minister could return to raise the issue of a proposed project, which, as in many cases, may not be approved for technical or legal reasons, including matters related to title.All I can say in response to the area highlighted by the Deputy is that the applications submitted were obviously of a very high quality and they passed muster in terms of all the assessments that were done.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Perhaps it is a follow-up coincidence that in the from 1999 to 2002 County Donegal had the highest per capita allocation in this respect.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	339	In context of the current round of allocations which have been expended, my constituency does not have the highest per capita allocation in this respect.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	340	It must have the second highest then.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Then the Minister was not doing his job.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	344	Latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show that, notwithstanding the difficult global environment, the number of overseas visitors for the first seven months of 2008 was just ahead of last year at more than 4.5 million.  Figures for July alone were less positive, which we all know.I understand that the indications are that the fall-off in monthly numbers seen in July was sustained in August.  This must be seen in context.  Global tourism and Irish tourism are facing exceptionally challenging conditions, including increased fuel costs and a global economic downturn, with adverse trends in exchange rates.  I understand that the recent fall-off mirrors trends across Europe, where the year started positively but saw a downturn in monthly figures from May onward.While Ireland, like a number of other high income countries, is not a mass tourism destination, its competitiveness in term of value for money and quality of experience is shown by our sustained ability to increase our share of visitors to Europe in recent years.Current indications are that Ireland is maintaining its market share in Europe and many competitors are faring less well, suggesting that the overall competitiveness of Irish tourism is holding.  As well as attractive air and sea access fares, there is very good value for money available in tourist accommodation at present, in particular given the addition to our hotel room capacity in recent years.While I know that our businesses are responding positively to current challenges, it is just as important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  I have therefore decided to initiate a short mid-term review of the tourism strategy, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: an Agenda for Action 2003-2012.  I will be putting in place the arrangements for the mid-term review in the coming weeks and I will seek for it to be completed by the end of the first quarter of next year.  In the meantime, an extensive range of marketing, product development, training and business supports are being rolled out by the tourism State agencies under the tourism services budget of the Department.  For example, the tourism marketing fund for this year provides for €50 million, the highest ever annual allocation for the international marketing effort.I am confident that the tourism sector here has the capacity to manage the current cyclical slowdown.  The mid-term review will help the sector to manage the current challenges and to return to sustainable growth in the medium term.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I thank the Minister for his reply.  The reality in respect of the visitor figures from Europe, which the Minister said are holding up, is that these represent low spend figures and they probably will disappear because all the indications are they are family members of migrant workers coming to Ireland.  Those visitors will disappear if the reports we hear about high unemployment among migrant workers are true.The point I wish to make, about which I believe the Minister and I are in agreement, is that our tourism industry is facing difficult times.  Not only is the global tourism market shrinking but in Ireland we have the additional problems of high service charges, high energy costs, high VAT charges and a new pay round to be made.  The result is that, for a variety of reasons, profitability per room is now half what it was this time last year.There is considerable demand from the industry to maintain the amount of money being spent on marketing to ensure that we retain our market share and that we have an industry when all this financial chaos is over.  I wish to ask about the plethora of tourism bodies.  I am sure they are all doing a good job but, given that we have to examine every penny being spent, is having all these bodies the best way for us to get value for money?  Is it the best way to deliver what is absolutely necessary and what everybody wants to deliver?  All these bodies are being funded and one wonders if one body is duplicating the work of another.What exactly is the best way to target the marketing of our industry?  There is a need for a major change in the kind of marketing being undertaken.  The reality is that we will have to change to tourism that is not so dependent on discretionary spending.  If an American family was considering the value of the dollar and the cost of visiting Ireland, that family would say "No" to that idea of coming here.  However, an American businessman, a golf player or person attending a conference would be more likely to come to Ireland, and this is a tourism area where we are under-performing.Therefore, is there a need to change the way we market our industry and the number of bodies, at home and abroad, charged with that task?  Is there a way we can get better value for money?  Will the Minister ensure the marketing budget is maintained as that is crucial for the industry?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I am aware of the point the Deputy is making.  There is not really a plethora of organisations in place.  We have two major organisations, one of which is Tourism Ireland, which is responsible for marketing Ireland overseas on behalf of the whole island of Ireland.  It is a North-South body funded by both jurisdictions to carry out that task.  The other organisation is Fáilte Ireland, which has a major role and is probably seen by most people as the key body responsible for promoting and developing marketing policies for the benefit of all aspects of the tourism industry.The Deputy rightly said that there are issues of competitiveness.  People who have a good tourism product have to make sure that the value for money they are giving in comparison with their competitors in other countries is as good as it was.The Deputy is correct in saying that the type of business we can attract and continue to attract should be expanded in particular areas.  There is also the opportunity to target new markets.  There is no doubt that the Middle East and Far East present major opportunities.  These are vast markets into which we should try to market our tourism industry and maintain a big presence, given their scale and size.  Nevertheless, there are two aspects to that.  To expand those markets, we need direct flights from those markets to Ireland.  I have always said that and I did so when I was Minister for Transport.  I signed many agreements and, hopefully, when all the works are completed at Dublin Airport, it will be able to facilitate long-haul flights.The Deputy might reflect on what Ireland has achieved.  We were the most successful country in Europe to recover after the 11 September events and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease at that time.  The policies have been working to a large degree, but that is not to say that we should not always keep them under review.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Given the economic situation, I am strongly of the view, and have conveyed it to both marketing organisations, that they should get much greater value for every euro spent in the coming year than they might have received in the preceding years because there is a real reduction in available spend across the business world in terms of accessing media to promote one's message.  The value that one can get in terms of every euro spent for next year should be far greater than one might have got in previous years.  It is important to bear that in mind.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	351	It is intended to complete the remaining 20 pools under the current round of the local authority swimming pool programme.  A total of 57 applications were received under the current round.  Some 37 pools have been completed and opened to the public, eight in respect of which funding has been allocated are under construction and a further 12 are at various stages of development.  Funding in respect of the latter will be allocated by my Department in due course.  Funding is available to support the existing projects in the current round of the local authority swimming programme.  As already stated, however, given the current budgetary constraints, it is not intended to launch a new round at this time.  Noteworthy progress has been made in the context of the current programme and our priority now is to work with the relevant local authorities in bringing into public use the remaining 20 pools included under the current round.A value for money policy review report of the local authority swimming pool programme was carried out by my Department to examine, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The report has been published and the recommendations it contains will be considered in the context of future rounds of the programme.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	352	The swimming pool programme is crucial to many communities.  A slowdown appears to have occurred in respect of the 21 swimming pools that were meant to be part of that programme.  The Minister stated that the challenge now is to work with the relevant local authorities in completing the remaining 21 pools.  I hope this will happen sooner rather than later.  There is no timeframe in respect of this matter and while there may be duplication of certain sporting facilities in many of the communities with which I am familiar, there is no such duplication when it comes to swimming pools.  For example, the swimming pool in Crumlin was built in 1970 and badly requires an upgrade.The Minister will agree that swimming is one of the best forms of exercise in which one can engage.  When one considers the health aspects etc., it would be a shame if the swimming pool programme was limited in any way.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I do not disagree with the Deputy.  I take a strong view regarding the value of sport, in all its guises, for young people.  Many Members enjoyed participating in sport when they were much younger.  It makes a huge contribution in the context of people's general health, their development of social and interactional skills and the way in which they mature.Some 57 applications were received under the current round of the programme.  Some 37 pools have been completed and opened, eight are under construction and a further 12 are at various stages of development.  I am not in a position to open a new round at present.  As stated, however, the resources are in place to allow the completion of projects under the current round.  When that is done, resources permitting, I would like to commence a new round because the swimming pool programme adds enormously to communities.  There is no age barrier to swimming.  People of all ages and genders can use swimming pools and obtain major benefits from doing so.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	354	At present, Ireland has one pool per 58,000 people.  In Northern Ireland it is one per 32,000 and in Scotland it is one per 15,000.  Our objective is to have one pool per 50,000 by 2011.  Will that objective be achieved?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Based on the current programme, it will be achieved.  However, I would like us to reach a position where we would be closer to the international average of one pool per 28,000 people.

We were able to instigate the programme only in recent years when the necessary resources were available.  This is not merely a national project, there is involvement on the part of local authorities, communities and the Department.  As stated, 57 applications were received and 27 pools have been completed and opened, eight are under construction and a further 12 are at various stages of development.  The latter will be completed and we must then move on to the next round.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics task force was established in August 2006 to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from its proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic games that will be held in London in 2012.  The task force included experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and was supported by staff from within my Department.In its report, the task force makes a number of recommendations on foot of an audit carried out in respect of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.  The report highlights the opportunities for Ireland from the London 2012 games in the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors.  On the sporting side, proposals are put forward for investment in sports facilities which would increase our attractiveness as a training destination for Olympic teams in the lead up to and during the games.  I understand that inquiries have already been made about the availability of sports facilities here for some Olympic teams.During my recent attendance at the Beijing Olympics I engaged in informal discussions with Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Olympic Games organising committee, to discuss the role Ireland can play in the games.  I will shortly meet him in London to continue our discussions.I will consider the implementation of the recommendations of the London 2012 task force report in the context of the annual Estimates cycle and taking account of the current economic situation.  I also intend to meet the key stakeholders involved in the support of our elite athletes to discuss how we can best build on the success we had in Beijing and the supports required in terms of coaching, programmes, facilities and funding to ensure the optimum performance of Irish athletes at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I thank the Minister for his reply but I would like him to be more specific.  I detected an ominous note in what he said.  The Minister used the term "current economic situation".  When he arrived home from the Beijing Olympics, he referred to a need to put in place some of the facilities that would attract teams to Ireland prior to the games of 2012.  Do I take it that the position has changed?  Does the funding for Sports Campus Ireland remain secure?It is not merely a case of foreign teams benefiting from coming to Ireland, we need to prepare our Olympic team as well.  Some facilities are already in place which meet the required standard.  I refer here to those in Limerick, which can be accessed via Shannon Airport, and the Breaffy international complex in County Mayo, which can be accessed via Ireland West Airport at Knock.  Are there plans in place to allow us to work with our counterparts in Northern Ireland and share facilities to attract teams to locations north and south of the Border?  What plans are in place to exploit that which is already in existence?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	360	As the Deputy is aware, we are in the midst of an Estimates process at present.  What will happen in the future will be decided as the budget approaches.  However, this does not invalidate in any way what I said after the Olympic Games in Beijing.  The points I made then remain valid now and I have not changed my mind in respect of them.When people refer to 2012, it is usually in the context of huge teams coming to Ireland.  Irrespective of the facilities we have to offer, it is unlikely that this will happen to any great degree.  Some competitors in specific sports may come here for particular reasons.  There is, however, a range of areas on the tourism side from which we can benefit, particularly when one considers that the Olympic Games of 2012 will be staged in London.I am of the view — this is no secret — that the development of a cohort of sports facilities is vital to the long-term future of sport in this country.  I support what has been said in the various reports in this regard.  However, I am obliged to operate within the constraints of the current budgetary framework.  Everyone will accept that this framework has, for many reasons of an international nature, radically changed from what it was only 12 months ago.  I continue to examine how we might maximise the opportunities that exist in the context of developing our athletes as well as providing facilities for those of other countries.  What is essential to most elite sportsmen and women is international competition.  In Ireland we do not have facilities for major international competition.  Most of our elite athletes, in any discipline, want to compete at the highest level and that requires them to be abroad quite a lot.  When I was in China I learned that some athletes did no training in China.  For example, China sent its cyclists to Switzerland.  They were literally sent to Switzerland for the past four years to be involved and trained there, irrespective of the facilities.  They were sent there so they could get the competition.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The opportunity presented to us by the 2012 Olympics will not present so close to us again.  Despite the economic climate, we may not get this opportunity to develop our facilities again for some time.  There is, therefore, a special case for advancing funding to do this.  The Minister said that the Chinese team did all its training abroad.  Why not let Ireland be the country where some of these teams do their training?  I admit we do not have the facilities to stage international events, but developing facilities would benefit us through being a first step towards achieving that.  That is important.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I do not want to give the impression that whole teams were training abroad.  I was talking about a specific part of a team.  It was not because of lack of resources in China that it sent cyclists to train in Switzerland.  The reason is that Switzerland is the centre of excellence in terms of training.  Currently, we have cyclists involved in specific high level programmes in Europe.  Even if we had the best facilities here, it would be pointless having those cyclists here because the competition and gathering of an international cohort working together lifts the standard for all of them.  They need to be together to learn from each other and to compete and upgrade their standards.  That is not to say we do not need some facilities here.  We do, but the best training is a mix of the different aspects.  I agree we should capitalise as much as we can on 2012.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Dublin hosted the first culture night in 2006.  On culture night key artistic and cultural venues extend their opening hours until late in the evening, providing the public with increased access.  Since then the Department's focus has been to develop the event, in conjunction with the Temple Bar cultural trust, which co-ordinates the event by encouraging more venues to participate and to remain open later in the evening.  The trust met representatives from the cultural community in Belfast with a view to launching a North-South culture night project for 2009.  In addition, following a request from the Department, the trust investigated the possible extension of the culture night concept to areas outside Dublin.An important element for the success of the culture night concept is the concentration of cultural organisations in an area able to offer a range of cultural activities.  Taking into account the findings received from the Temple Bar cultural trust, the Department offered assistance to the city managers of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford in the promotion of culture night in these cities.  I am pleased to say that all four cities participated in culture night on Friday, 19 September 2008.  The Department also wrote to the County and City Managers Association highlighting the high level of participation in Dublin's  culture night and how successful the event is in building and sustaining a strategy for cultural tourism.Over 80 arts and cultural organisations participated in the Dublin event in 2008, including the national cultural institutions.  It is estimated that 100,000 people took part, many of whom would have been visiting Dublin's cultural organisations for the first time.  The cities of Limerick, Galway, Cork and Waterford also programmed approximately 50 events on the night.Culture night promotes access to and participation in the cultural life of each city.  A key factor in its success to date is the partnering of the cultural community with the business community, and the active participation of the tourism and transportation bodies.  It is modelled on similar successful events in other European cities, which concentrate on providing cultural and artistic events on one evening, in some cases round the clock, rather than over a weekend.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	364	It is nice for the Opposition spokesperson to be able to say congratulations and well done to everybody involved in culture night.  I attended, but the problem I had was there was too much to do.  There were too many options, but that is not really a criticism.  The event was excellent and should be flagged.  Many people I know had nothing to do with cultural events prior to that, but they were very happy to participate on the night and take part.  They enjoyed being able to see the various museums and galleries open to them, including Leinster House.If I have a criticism it is that because there was so much to do and so many places to go, it was not extended to two nights so that people could have returned another evening or the following day to see some of the other venues.  I appreciate the value of having everything on one night because there is a great buzz around that, but it is worth exploring the idea of extending culture night.  I should say that culture night catered for all age groups and people were happy about that.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I thank the Deputy for her comments.  We all agree culture night was an outstanding success.  It got great public coverage, which helped bring the message of what was happening to people.  One can never win — the Deputy suggested there was too much to do, whereas, usually, the criticism is there is not enough to do.  Culture night is a work in progress in terms of learning how to manage a programme of this scale.  It is heartening that the public responds in such significant numbers and from all age groups to these types of events.  We will consider how we can maximise the interest.One of the major benefits of how culture night is structured is that it is cost effective.  We do not have to invest significant funds in it, which is what makes it such a huge success.  We do not want to turn the event into something that costs millions to organise.  It has good success and balance and we must consider how we can retain its ethos and flavour if we need to expand it, not just in Dublin, but in the other four cities.  It could expand to other cities also, such as Wexford, Kilkenny and others.  Perhaps it would be more important and beneficial to consider expanding it throughout the country rather than just increasing participation in Dublin.  That is what I would like to do in the future.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	367	As the Deputy will be aware, primary responsibility for the negotiations on introducing pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon airports rests with my colleague, the Minister for Transport.  As I said previously, the introduction of pre-clearance facilities would have some positive aspects for Irish tourism.  If such an agreement could be reached, it would help Dublin and Shannon airports to better position themselves as hubs for US bound flights.  Furthermore, such an agreement could in time encourage the development of new routes into Shannon and Dublin airports from some of the smaller American airports.With regard to the finalisation of an agreement, I understand that significant progress has been made on the issue.  Good progress has been made in the interim and I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Transport, is hopeful that this agreement can be concluded in the very near future.  Work will then commence on drafting the necessary legislation, which will be introduced as soon as possible.The Department will continue to liaise closely with the Department of Transport on the issue and when an agreement is finalised, I will encourage all the relevant stakeholders, including the relevant tourist agencies, to take all necessary steps to maximise the potential benefits of the new procedures.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The Minister knows I raise this issue every month.  As former Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen appreciates the importance of pre-clearance facilities.  It was promised these would be in place by the end of this year, but it is clear that will not happen.  It was promised to Shannon in the context of open skies to help it capitalise on that.  The advantages of open skies have been almost eroded by current events in terms of finance throughout the world, particularly in America.  Shannon is concerned that it will lose its advantage to Dublin and that pre-clearance facilities will be available in Dublin as soon as in Shannon.  My concern is they will be available in some other country before either Dublin or Shannon.  That is a major concern.The reason I press this issue is there is a real problem emerging in terms of access to Ireland.  The Minister is aware tour operators have been falling by the wayside over the summer and that airlines have been pulling out of Ireland.  I will not mention the problems in Aer Lingus.  There is a genuine fear that other airlines will pull out of Ireland as a result of the shrinkage of the market.  If we had pre-clearance facilities ahead of other European countries, that would be a significant benefit in attracting airlines here.  Once the pattern of travel is established, it is very difficult to change it.  If France gets the facility first, airlines will fly there rather than to Ireland.  It is, therefore, important we get it first.  Can anything be done to introduce the legislation in advance of the finalisation of the agreement with the US?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	369	As the Deputy will be aware, this is an issue with which I am very familiar because I was centrally involved in it as Minister for Transport, and I believe strongly in advancing it.  Unfortunately, the difficulties rest with those with whom we have to work rather than with ourselves.  A combination of groups, including Ireland and the US as sovereign Governments, are involved in developing the facilities.The current Minister for Transport sees the benefits arising from an agreement and I have stated on several occasions the importance of putting Shannon in place because this would give the area a kick-start in terms of having the unique selling point of full clearance facilities for Ireland.  I understand there is no intention on the American side to look elsewhere in Europe because it is satisfied that Ireland is the best location.  Two facilities, Shannon and Dublin, would more than adequately cover the requirements.I am aware of business people who have decided to transit through Dublin or Shannon to the United States because of the clearance facilities currently available.  The Deputy will concur that the new facilities would add greatly to the selling points that Ireland offers.  Not only do they offer significant benefits for outbound as opposed to incoming traffic, but they also have great potential in terms of sustaining existing airlines and attracting new long-haul routes.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	370	We are told that the legislation needed to establish pre-clearance facilities in Dublin and Shannon will not be introduced until next year.  British Airways has already announced that it will use London City Airport and Shannon Airport as transit stages for New York.  Will the legislation be in place before these flights commence?I understand other European airports, including Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt, are seeking to develop pre-clearance facilities.  It is important that the legislation is fast-tracked because Shannon and Dublin need to be established.Corporate jets provide further opportunities.  Approximately 700 corporate jets cross the Atlantic Ocean each week and I understand these will stop at either Shannon or Dublin to get pre-clearance.  They will be of significant benefit to my region, particularly given the current turbulence in Aer Lingus.  I ask the Minister to press his colleague to fast-track this legislation.  I understand that the Irish authorities are holding up progress but that the deal has been done on the American side.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I assure the Deputy that work had already commenced on the legislation while I was Minister, so there is no question of my colleague being slow in progressing it.  The Government is aware of the benefits of this agreement.  We will certainly endeavour to establish facilities at Shannon at the earliest opportunity, although the construction work on Dublin Airport will have to be completed before a facility is established there because it will be located in the new terminal building.I understand that all the major technical and legal issues that have arisen in respect of both the US and Ireland have been resolved and we are now working on minor issues.  It is the intention of the Minister for Transport to bring the legislation before the House as soon as it is ready and I am sure all Deputies will want to support that so that the facilities can be opened at the earliest opportunity.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I ask for clarity on the nature of the delay.  When I last asked this question in June, I received more or less the same answer.  Has anything happened since then?  Has the Minister met his counterpart in the United States and what has to happen next in regard to the legislation?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The Deputy can elicit much of that information from the Minister for Transport.  I do not wish to avoid her question but I simply do not know who he has met.  I know, however, that he is very committed to this issue.  I had a conversation with him recently on this and I am almost certain that he has held meetings but I would need to confirm that.  A number of technical issues arose that needed to be resolved, although these were not necessarily on our side.  One of the main issues is that the global environment for travel and security has changed dramatically.  The entire spectrum of requirements in terms of the information flows sought by the US had to be rethought.  I assure the House, however, that it is our intention to get Shannon up and running as quickly as possible.  This will provide an enormous boost to the airport by making it more attractive to new airlines.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I ask the Minister to ensure his colleague progress the matter.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 128 together.As required by the Government in dealing with the current financial difficulties, an amount of €5.978 million was identified as the savings to be achieved this year on the Votes of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the National Gallery.  The savings will be as follows: €3 million in Department operated capital programmes for cultural projects; €2 million in savings among our agencies in grant programmes; and an additional €978,000 in savings in administration costs and other efficiencies across the Department, the National Gallery and our agencies.In advising our agencies of the budgetary adjustments, the Department requested them to apply the savings in such a way as to have minimal impact on the levels of service to the public.  As the Deputies are aware, the Government is currently preparing for budget 2009 and until such time as the budget has been announced, I am not prepared to speculate on its impact of the Department's Vote.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I provided the Deputy with a formidable amount of information in response to an earlier question.  The number of validated claims received by the Department from the various promoters was lower than anticipated this year.  This probably reflects the general position of the construction industry.  In that way, we were able to make savings.My Department has almost completely decentralised to Killarney and only a few of us are left in Kildare Street.  Work on our new building will be complete by the end of the year.  Obviously we will have to maintain a presence in the Dáil when it is sitting and so on, for which a small cohort will be required.  This will be the first fully decentralised Department, to which I look forward.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The Minister mentioned capital for some of the cultural programmes, some of which are very important.  We would like to know which ones will be targeted.  From what the Minister said, he will not elaborate much further.  However, the issue is important.  There is also a more general point about the capital programme.  Although I have mentioned that we have duplication, for example, in some sports, I do not think we have this in cultural agencies or buildings, particularly in Dublin, but also around the country.  There may be a case for considering the Labour Party's proposal on the redeployment of people involved in the construction industry.  If there are big capital programmes, perhaps the focus could be redirected towards these, similar to our proposal for schools.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The reality is that these measures still require money.  As the Deputy knows, decisions in these areas are taken by the Arts Council, not by me.  The council organises its budgets.  We spoke to the agencies when we originally made our contribution to the adjustments made in July this year on behalf of the Government.  My understanding is that it has not really had a direct effect in stopping projects or withdrawing their funding.  However, some projects which it was anticipated would take place have not come to fruition this year, although they may well begin next year.  This represents a small amount of money spread over a number of projects.  I do not disagree — nor would anybody else — about the importance of these projects, particularly because they affect small communities and the benefit is there for all to see.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The Irish Sports Council, ISC, which is funded by my Department has statutory responsibility for encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and increasing participation in recreational sport.  All sports organisations funded by the ISC, including national governing bodies and local sports partnerships, are encouraged to target all sections of society in seeking to increase participation in sport.  The ISC, within its research remit, is striving to develop a profound understanding of sport in Ireland that can inform policy and investment in the coming years.The ISC has commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to undertake studies on its behalf.  The fifth report in the series, Sporting Lives: An Analysis of a Lifetime of Irish Sport, sets out to track the participation of Irish people in sport over the course of their lives based on a survey of adult participation in sport in 2003.  The data from the survey also allowed for an analysis of the amount and type of sport played in Ireland in recent decades and the relationship between participation in sport and personal health.  The report concludes that the current generation of Irish adults are playing more sport than previous generations.  That is an extremely positive outcome and one with which, collectively, we should be very pleased.  Interestingly, the report indicates that 76% of all sport for people over 18 years consists of individual activities rather than team-based sports.  The report also sets out the benefits of participation and concludes that people who participate in sport and exercise throughout their lives generally experience better physical and mental health than non-participants.The report is not without its challenges, particularly with regard to gender gaps — as I mentioned to Deputy Upton — and socio-economic gaps in sports participation.  Obviously the report requires careful consideration by the Department and the ISC with a view to assessing what changes might usefully be made to existing sports policy and such consideration is taking place.The series of ESRI reports endorse the view that, as an activity with proven benefits, sport has a strong case for substantial public expenditure to support initiatives which can increase participation.  This justifies the significant Government investment in sport in recent years.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.This increased investment has supported the promotion and development of Irish sport and the provision of a modern sports infrastructure, with high quality facilities catering for the participation, coaching, training and competition needs of all types of sport and at all levels.  The amount of funding available for sport in 2008 is more than €335 million which will serve to further enhance and develop the sports sector.  The increased funding provided for the ISC — from €13 million in 2000 to more than €57 million this year — has enabled a number of significant interventions for the benefit of disadvantaged areas.  Examples include the local sports partnership network and the Buntús programme for primary schools in local sports partnership areas which involves children in sport from a very young age.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	394	The Minister referred to a trend towards participation in individual sports.  This is a reflection of lifestyles and people's unwillingness to give the time and commitment involved with team sports.  It was in that context I tabled the question.  If there is an argument that because more people are involved in individual sports, funding should go towards facilities for individual sports rather than team sports, I contend there should be no reduction of funding for facilities for team and field sports.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's views on that issue.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I agree with the Deputy wholeheartedly.  Team sports are at the core of what sport is about, particularly for younger people.  Participation in team sports teaches our children so much in terms of their ability to cope with success, defeat and disappointments, their social skills and ability to interact with their friends, and their understanding of leadership and playing one's part.  There is a range of benefits to participation in team sports.  The challenge we all face — this is evident in some of our more traditional sports — is that in today's world the drop-off in team participation rates after the age of 16 or 18 years is significant.  There is a big challenge in keeping young people of that age involved in team sports.The other aspect of individual participation in adulthood is that it includes a lot of general physical activities such as aerobics.  I am not saying these are not sports, but I am not saying they are either.  The report refers to physical activity that keeps people mentally and physically well just by being involved.  We cannot start building individual facilities all over the place.  There is a need in some sports to provide basic training, for skills development or coaching.  As a nation there are areas in which we could do a lot better.  Irish people were very successful in many field sports around the turn of the last century when we participated in the Olympic Games, although not under our own flag.  If one looks at the names of those who delivered medals for the United Kingdom and the United States at the time, they are nearly all Irish.  This tells me there is nothing inherently wrong with the physical, mental or cultural make-up of Irish people that means we cannot be as good as any other country in field sports.  In this area we do need to provide facilities.  Overall, I am a strong believer in team sport.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The Minister referred to the point I was intending to raise, the dropping out of over 16s from team sports.  This is particularly significant in more socially deprived areas where the alternatives are often unattractive and undesirable such as anti-social behaviour.  I wonder what specific initiatives can be taken to ensure young people who might be vulnerable are encouraged to remain in or return to sport after the age of 16 years, when they are particularly prone to dropping out.  I presume it has something to do with the fact that, as they have left school, school sports facilities are no longer available to them and so on.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	397	There are other attractions also.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	398	That is true; I agree with the Minister.  Nobody could do anything about those attractions, nor would they want to change them.  However, there may be a significant factor that needs to be addressed; for example, in socially deprived areas we must ensure the facilities are in place to keep young people involved in sport.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Two areas are starkly identified in the most recent report which I launched some months ago — Deputy Mitchell was present — which was commissioned by the Irish Sports Council.  These are the participation of young girls in sport and the participation and retention of young children in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.  Coincidentally, I happened to have a meeting this week with a local sports partnership and was surprised at the people, organisations and community groups involved.  This is made possible through funding from the Irish Sports Council.  Significant amounts are being invested directly.  Much of their remit is to work in disadvantaged areas.  While there are many soccer, GAA and rugby clubs etc. in these areas, they tend not to get all the children involved.  The participation of the sports partnerships in encouraging them to work in some cases directly with those clubs is allowing young children who are disadvantaged in some way to feel they can easily join a club and gain all the benefits of membership.  Considerable work is being done in that regard.  As a follow-up to the report commissioned by the Irish Sports Council, it is considering the new programmes we need to develop.  All the sporting bodies would have recognised this issue in recent years and many programmes have been redirected.  However, much work remains to be done in that area.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Team sport needs to maintain the priority it had.  While after the age of 40 very few people are playing a team sport, the report indicates people are more likely to turn to another sport if they have already been playing a sport or a team sport.  However, my concern is about the gender gap.  That same research indicated that girls were already disadvantaged in terms of participation in sport before they even go to primary school.  By the age of 20 only half as many girls as boys were involved in sport.  That gap never closes and even grows over age.  It cannot simply be a case of business as usual regarding how we direct funding.  In particular there needs to be a concentration on finding sports that are attractive to girls.  Clearly some of the team sports do not appeal to girls, for instance, rugby, although I believe tag rugby is the big thing now for girls.  There needs to be a reconsideration of where funding is going if we are to get equity in participation.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I agree with the Deputy's reading of the report.  It is very important to get girls interested in sport at primary level.  Obviously it is much harder to engage them at an older age, as it would be with anybody who does not have that ethos and is not used to such participation.  Emphasis needs to be placed on that matter.  I am working with the Department of Education and Science on the schools system in its broadest sense, particularly with primary schools, to instil that opportunity into girls at that age so that they can take it through into second level education.  Many sports like basketball, volleyball and hockey are becoming more popular.  It is easier for girls to participate in these sports and we need to ensure we have the resources in place to do that.  It is not beyond us to go down this road in coming years and to have a successful outcome by targeting the resources in the correct way and get co-ordination between all the bodies with responsibility.Question No. 128 answered with Question No. 126.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I am considering the vacancies on the board of the Arts Council and hope to make an announcement in the immediate future.  The remaining members of the board, whose terms expire in 2011, are sufficient to provide a quorum for the council and under the Arts Act 2003 the deputy chair can take the place of the chair until a new chair is appointed.In appointing new members to the board cognisance needs to be had of the following provisions under the Arts Act 2003.  Members of the Arts Council must have a special interest in or knowledge of the arts.  The board must have a minimum of six men and six women; therefore the new appointments must be made up of a minimum of one man and five women and the chair can be either male or female.  Persons aged 70 or over cannot be appointed to State boards.  A range of all disciplines as per the Arts Act needs to be represented.  The Act states that "arts" means any creative or interpretative expression, whether traditional or contemporary, in whatever form, and includes, in particular, visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, film, circus and architecture, and includes any medium when used for those purposes.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I understand from speaking to former members of the Arts Council that the remaining members are not quorate.  Given that the budget will be announced shortly, they are most anxious that they will be in a position to implement their spending plans with all speed immediately after the budget.  At the moment they feel hamstrung owing to the lack of members.I wish to comment about the independence of members of boards, particularly the chairperson of a board.  I do not in any way criticise the outgoing chairperson of the Arts Council, who was superb and very committed.  Nevertheless she was placed in an invidious position, being clearly a supporter of a particular party.  When people have two masters it is very difficult for them to perform their job with absolute independence.  I can think of other cases.  For instance, the chairperson of the Disability Authority is also the CEO of Rehab.  It is client and master together and it is a very difficult position in which to place people.I am anxious that there would be transparency in the appointment of people to the Arts Council, in particular where independence is required.  They are supposed to be the challengers of society who question what we do and how we go forward.  The Minister should ensure that whoever is appointed will be able to serve the arts community and the taxpayer rather than any political master.

However, I wanted to put it on the record for fear that if I did not respond it might be taken to acquiesce with the Deputy's view.  She is superb in the roles she fulfils.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	412	It is an unfair position in which to put someone.

My intent is to appoint someone to the chair of the Arts Council who has an interest in and some knowledge of the arts and has the business capacity to manage a budget in the order of €70 million or €80 million, which is very significant.  That is not a small business, it is a significant amount of resources.  I have not made a decision.  I probably would have preferred to have done so, but events in the past week or two got in the way of doing so.  I intend to make that announcement as quickly as possible.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I am surprised and shocked to hear that someone over 70 may not be a member of the board.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	415	That has nothing to do with the Arts Council.  That is the general legislative position relating to all State bodies.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I appreciate that, but it is food for thought and is something we should consider.  It is ageist.  In the context of arts and culture, there are so many excellent people over 70 in the arts world who would be excellent in that role.  We should do it as a precedent to at least shake up the legislation in that area.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	417	That is the position.  I agree it appears somewhat ageist.  I am unsure as to the genesis of this legislation and whether it was introduced in recent years or in years past.  We are all living much longer and are hopefully much healthier.  Perhaps the provision could be reconsidered in the future.  It was not regarding the Arts Council that I made the point, it was regarding State boards in general, and that is the legislative position.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 169 together.Funding for touring is provided by the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is statutorily independent under the Arts Act 2003 and I have no role to play in its specific funding decisions.In 2007 and 2008 combined, approximately €2.5 million has been spent by the council to support touring.  This is in addition to touring provision embedded in revenue grants to organisations.  The Arts Council introduced a touring programme in late 2006 for which funding of €1.7 million was made available in 2007.  The council expects an analysis report on the touring programme to be completed in 2008 at which time the council will consider its recommendations and the options for the future.  In the meantime, the council has provided a further €757,000 in grants for touring in 2008.In addition, in the context of its 80th anniversary, the Department has provided €250,000 for the Gate Theatre in 2008 to part fund its 40-venue tour of "Waiting for Godot".  This tour is under way and each venue visited to date has been sold out.  Clearly, any allocation for touring in 2009 will have to be made by the Arts Council in the context of the allocation available to it and based on the analysis of the programme in the last two years.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I agree with the Minister about the great success of the "Waiting for Godot" project which has been very well received around the country.  However, while he says he is not directly responsible for the touring project funding, he has responsibility for the access programme and welcome hundreds of millions spent on theatres and arts facilities around the country.  However, there was a purpose in building them — to fill them with art productions.  The reality is that value for money is not being obtained from them and the money being spent on behalf of the taxpayer because the funding simply is not available for companies to tour.  If performances of a proper standard cannot be staged for the regions, there is no point in building facilities there.  We have spent the money and must now find that little extra to ensure all of the best productions — dance, opera etc. — travel around the country.  There is no point in having all of them in Dublin, if we have built facilities and continue to build them around the country.  They find it extremely difficult to operate to full capacity.  Many are closed during the week and there is great difficulty in maintaining them because there is simply no income available.  The reality is that while the Minister is not directly responsible, he does have responsibility to show value for money from what has been spent.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I agree about the facilities already in place all over the country through the access programme which has been very valuable.  All of us will have seen many of these facilities.  It is clear some areas are far better than others in maximising the use of a theatre.  It comes down to the personalities involved — the drive, energy and vision shown in the different areas.  I am strongly supportive of the touring programme and have conveyed that view.  It is not just about "Waiting for Godot" which has been an enormous success.  I have seen the production around the country and it has filled all of the theatres.  Given the quality of the actors involved, people would come from all over the world to see it; they are just outstanding.  They have made what I would consider to be a very difficult and inaccessible play as accessible as they can in terms of the way it is presented because of the sheer quality of their acting.  This tells us that there is a hunger all around the country for quality theatre.  Because of what has happened in recent times with touring programmes and their success, we need much more.  That responds to the essential point made by the Deputy to the effect that while we have invested on the capital side, we now need to ensure we invest on the current side to support programmes that clearly reach out into all communities.  It has been demonstrated that they can fill theatres all over the country and have been very successful for all the audiences involved, whether young or old.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Can I look for forward to seeing additional funding being made available next week?
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	422	Perhaps I can ask the same question: can we look forward to seeing additional funding?  I was one of those lucky enough to obtain tickets for "Waiting for Godot" and it was superb.  Earlier we spoke about the culture night concept being extended around the country.  Clearly, there is a hunger for the arts, not just in Dublin, as the Minister has pointed out.  It is important that the facilities are in place.  Small theatre companies simply cannot afford it, unless they have a commitment to carry out their programme successfully.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	423	The Minister for Finance will present the budget next week and we shall see exactly where we stand.  It does not in any way invalidate my view which I have shared with the House in terms of the value of many programmes.  I intend, no matter what resources are available, to try to support these programmes.  I agree, absolutely, that the touring programme, in all its guises, is enormously successful and that it should be expanded and promoted.  However, as I said, the Arts Council will make the decision.  It certainly knows my general approach and views as regards its value.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

The matters raised by Deputies O'Donnell and O'Sullivan, Neville, Sheahan and McHugh have been accepted for discussion.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	425	Before the break I was discussing the terms of reference the commission had been given and made the point that these had been set by the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition Government.  When we had statements on the matter in the summer, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who was appointed, obviously, by the Taoiseach said that precedent should not be broken.  That point has been made today by other speakers.  The commission was set up in the late 1970s and there has not been a change since.   We have had a succession of statements in the intervening period taking the exact opposite position, calling for an end to precedent and the seeking of greater consensus.  I shall deal shortly with how it might be changed.  The point should be made, however, that while some of us might be particularly affected, we should not necessarily have the power to change constituency boundaries because obviously we might proceed in our own interests rather than the greater democratic good.  There was talk at the time that matters could be changed if all parties agreed.  I believe one Fianna Fáil Deputy put this argument in a letter to people in his constituency and the issue was raised in the House at the time.  At no point were any solutions or changes on offer.  At no point did Fine Gael receive any basis for discussing this proposal or working on it.  That is the reality.  Some county councillors, in particular, are disappointed at the lack of progress in this regard, but no realistic attempt was ever made to do anything about it.  Like it or not, what happens here tends to boil down to the numbers game.  If people on the other side of the House feel that strongly about particular issues, they have the numbers and the power to make the changes, regardless of whether the Opposition likes it.Deputy Cregan made a point that the effect of such changes could ruin the careers of individuals and said we did not have to accept the report.  If I understood him correctly, he was saying that if we changed it, it would not mean all others had to be altered — he cited health and so on as examples.  Health and other reports that come before us can actually affect people's lives, not just their careers.  If we want to break precedent, there are plenty of other reports at which we could look.  Many speakers on all sides of the House would be willing to see some reports on other areas that have been proposed and not implemented — at least not in their totality — changed.I want to make a point as regards my constituency, especially the area of south Offaly.  There is no doubt that the people of that area want to vote in the constituency in which they have always voted, Laois-Offaly.  No doubt, I want them to continue to vote there also.  It must be emphasised that this proposal represents a breach of a provincial boundary.  Effectively, people from County Offaly are being asked to vote in Munster, in a constituency that will be called North Tipperary, which bears no reference to the name of their own county.  This will be alien to many, a point that needs to be made.  Deputy Cregan stated he would have to shift his tent to a different area.  I will not have to do so but I am unhappy to lose the portion of my constituency I have lost.The area affected comprises Shinrone, Moneygall, Dunkerrin, Coolderry and Barna and it is even more disturbing that a village such as Coolderry is being divided.  As a consequence, some people in the parish will vote in north Tipperary or Munster and the remainder will vote in the Laois-Offaly constituency.  This will create significant confusion.  While general elections in recent years have always been held on separate dates to local and European elections because the House has not fallen, a general election could be held on the same date as local and European elections.  If that happens, I am not sure which polling booths voters in Coolderry, for example, should attend.  Will officials from North Tipperary and Offaly County Councils operate from the same polling booth to ensure votes are cast in all three elections?  These issues have not been adequately teased out and they will cause confusion.People's resolve in this regard should not be underestimated.  When the constituency review was published, I received negative feedback in the area because people do not feel any affinity with their new constituency and they feel less inclined to vote.  The one saving grace is the legislation will take account of the Clarke judgment and preliminary census figures can be used in future to redraw constituencies.  Government Members and councillors in the south Offaly area who are concerned about the recent change can take heart from the fact that the person who has the power to name the date of the next general election and to wait until the preliminary census figures are published is the Taoiseach.  He may give consideration to the wishes of the people of south Offaly if the census highlights a population change in the area.Deputy Varadkar referred to the operation of electoral commissions in other countries, which produce interim reports for consultation.  The Constituency Commission will argue consultation was facilitated and people could have made submissions, but no one in south Offaly ever envisaged that a portion of the constituency, which had never been touched in the history of the State, would be transferred to Munster.  They, therefore, did not feel the need to make submissions.  Should they have made submissions seeking the status quo or should they have made submissions stating other towns and villages should be hived elsewhere?  That is not realistic.  If the Constituency Commission had reported and people could have had a debate on the report and made submissions on its recommendations, difficulties such as that in south Offaly could have been ironed out.  When the preliminary figures for the next census are published, the Government should give consideration to doing this because it is important.Spending limits for both local and general elections will be examined and proposed local government legislation will provide us with an opportunity to discuss the issue.  There is a great deal of merit to examining how such limits are decided and to include the period in the lead up to the calling of elections and not only the period from when the election is called.  However, I issue a word of caution.  A candidate can submit his or her name on the day nominations close having spent significant sums prior to that, which is not reckonable.  This is of particular concern to us as sitting Members.  It is generally accepted all of us will run in a general election whereas it will not be as clear where other candidates are concerned.  The amount spent must be examined and a fairer system needs to be introduced.  Deputy Varadkar suggests spending limits should be set on the basis of population but I have a different perspective coming from a rural constituency.  I could do a leaflet drop with constituency workers in Tullamore in a night, despite it being a large town, but it could take a month to do a similar drop in the town's hinterland.  Other more expensive methods must be considered as a result.  Cognisance, therefore, must be taken of the urban-rural divide.I reiterate the need to change how boundary reviews are conducted in future.  I am proud to serve south Offaly and I will continue to serve the constituency of Laois-Offaly because the people elected me to do so for the lifetime of the Dáil.  Unlike Deputy Cregan, I will not have to shift my tent but I will have to shift somebody else's to replace the votes I have lost.  The Constituency Commission members are decent people but they need to be more cognisant of the strength of feeling in particular areas.  Everyone cannot intimately know the Deputies who represent them but parish and provincial boundaries need to remain intact for the sake of the people and the practicalities involved.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation, which provides for the enactment of the revisions of the Dáil and European Parliament constituencies in accordance with the recommendations of the Constituency Commission's report, published approximately a year ago.  When Dáil constituencies are revised, there are always issues about boundary lines and the rationale behind changes.  Reference was made to submissions by the public on the constituency reviews.  A high percentage of submissions to the Constituency Commission related to County Leitrim but it was divided and, therefore, I am not sure whether they are being take into account.  In 1977, an independent commission was set up redraw constituencies to reflect population change and it is vitally important to ensure such a commission remains sacrosanct.  Prior to the establishment of a new commission, both Houses should debate constituency revisions to boundaries for all elections before changes are proposed.Over the past number of years, we have experienced significant population growth, which has required many changes to constituencies.  Significant population loss has occurred in inner cities and rural areas while the commuter belts around our major cities have expanded dramatically.The Bill is now before the House.  The commission was established under the Electoral Act 1997.  On 26 April 2007, it was constituted to make a report on the constituencies for the election of Members of Dáil Éireann and the European Parliament.  The commission's report and its recommendations was presented to the Ceann Comhairle on 23 October 2007 and we are now processing the legislation.  In the past 12 months, there was much debate on where to draw the boundaries.  In the first weeks and months, there was concern about whether the recommendations would be implemented.  However, we are putting into law the commission's exact recommendations.While we must follow this important precedent, we should examine the reports before their completion.  The constitutional position is that the number of Deputies must be fixed from time to time and that the constituencies from which they are elected must be determined by law.  Thus, the final determination of the constituencies of Dáil Éireann is a matter for the Oireachtas via legislation.  The commission's role is advisory, but it is important that it be respected.In recent years, different constituencies have experienced significant changes.  Many people have considered the merits of dividing towns, parishes and so forth.  We must accept the commission's reports, but we should have greater input before their completion.  Since the establishment of the independent commission in the late 1970s, it has been established practice that the Government accepts the recommendations in the report.  The Bill provides accordingly.  The final determination of constituencies is a matter for the Oireachtas to prescribe in legislation.Over the years, various Bills have made it somewhat easier for people to get on election tickets.  It is vital that Members of Dáil Éireann ensure that the respect of the people for our democracy is absolute.  It has often been stated that many people fought hard and went through difficult times to ensure a free and Irish democracy.  Some countries do not have democracy.  Our difficulty lies in the fluctuations in our population.  It rose before the last general election but, for one reason or another, there is a steady decline in the numbers participating in the democratic process.Before discussing the electoral register, I point out that voting is mandatory in some countries.  I am unsure as to whether this infringes on someone's democratic right to make a decision, but it is important that the process starts at a young age.  There are CSPE classes in post-primary schools, but there should be some in primary schools to encourage people to become involved in the democratic process.  As I have often told young people — all public representatives meet various classes — politics is not just about elected Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann, Members of the European Parliament or councillors.  Rather, it is a mirror of what is occurring in one's local community and life.  Politics, whether it is party politics, at the level of elected representatives, in a GAA club or in a community development association, is concerned with life and it is important that we encourage people into it.I am unsure about mandatory voting, but it is vital that we make young people believe that, when they vote, they will give effect to what they believe should occur in their society and community.  It is not just a matter of elected Members far from their communities.  As a famous Speaker of the House of Representatives stated, all politics is local, but it is concerned with people participating in the democratic process.  Over the years, people's opinion of politics and politicians has diminished, but it behoves every Deputy to uphold what exists in our community and country.In the past two revisions, my constituency has witnessed considerable changes, including the entrance of a large urban area.  Cork North-West is one of the few constituencies that mirrors almost all aspects of society, ranging from a large urban centre to a rural setting.  Deputy Stanton is thinking about east Cork in this regard.  Other constituencies are predominantly rural or urban, but Cork North-West contains every facet and its elected Members must try to represent every aspect.In this revision, the parish of Kilshannig will move from Cork North-West into Cork North-Central.  Like other speakers, I wonder about the wisdom of aligning my constituency with the city constituency of Cork North-Central almost as far as Mallow.  Perhaps the constituencies should be completely revamped.  However, the legislation will give effect to the commission's report and I am strongly of the opinion that its recommendations be implemented.  Any deviation would not be good for politics because it would be a return to the old days.Before the commission makes a future report on any revised forum, it is important that we have an opportunity to debate it and to make an input irrespective of whether our input is taken on board.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I am pleased to be able to make a short contribution on this important Bill.  When we debate electoral Bills, we are discussing our democracy and the democratic process.  In this Bill, we could address the matter of encouraging people to vote, the reasons they do not vote and how to make it easier for them to vote.  I wish to discuss these issues later.On the Constituency  Commission's report, it used to be the case that the Minister made the decisions.  Thankfully, the situation has changed and there is an independent commission consisting of five eminent persons.  I will make a suggestion for the Minister of State's consideration of the Bill.  While there is a provision for people to make submissions, experienced former politicians from all sides should sit as an advisory group to the commission because their input could be invaluable.  Were they able to work in a reflective way and were the commission to consult them rather than be dictated to by them, it would help the commission's work significantly.Many colleagues have commented on the fact that, for various reasons, natural boundaries and geographical areas have been breached by the commission, county boundaries in particular.  Counties Kerry, Limerick and others come to mind.  It might be the case that the input of eminent former politicians might inform the commission that this might not be the best way to go for the sake of the confused people on the ground, not for the sake of politicians.I note the attempt to link local electoral areas with Dáil electoral areas.  It is important that, if possible, local election areas be contained within Dáil areas because people get confused.  If a Deputy is representing people in the Dáil and a councillor at local authority area it can be confusing.  It is best if local and Dáil electoral areas are linked.We should examine ways to make the work of the commission more public and transparent.  The commission could hold public hearings because this would involve the public in the process, much like the Forum for Europe.  Deputy Terence Flanagan referred to the fact there were only eight public submissions on the European Parliament constituency boundaries.  We should include the public more by holding meetings in public around the country.  People might attend and get involved with the work of the commission.Making the work of the Dáil more accessible will be helped by the Oireachtas television channel.  Everything we do is in public but a television channel will help.  The idea is to involve the people even more.Other speakers have referred to the need to reform the electoral register.  Many are registered to vote in a number of locations and others are not registered to vote.  This is always a major issue.  Polling cards are often issued to the deceased.  I wonder why franchise officers cannot keep an eye on the death notices in newspapers.  It is not easy but if that was done, the names of deceased people could be removed from the electoral register.  This could also be done by contacting undertakers.  It is disconcerting for people to get polling cards for those who are deceased and it can be upsetting.I note that in the referendum on the Lisbon treaty the deadline for voter registration was quite short.  Many people lost out, especially in respect of postal voting.  Many of us have come across people who wanted to vote but could not.  The next election will be the local and European elections on 11 June.  Many people go on holidays at this time of the year and therefore will be disenfranchised.  I suggested a mechanism whereby those who go on holidays can register for a postal vote prior to leaving, provided they show an airline ticket or another document proving they are going on holidays.  Many people want to vote but cannot because of this issue.  Recently, our elections have been held in June, when older people go on holidays to take advantage of the fact that schools are not on holidays.This is important legislation.  It is a pity that natural and county boundaries are breached.  I ask that the issue of postal votes for those going on holidays be examined.  The voting systems for those with disabilities or in hospital could be streamlined to make it easier for them to obtain postal votes.  It is quite a cumbersome method at the moment.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I thank Deputies on all sides for their contributions.  Comments focussed on the Bill and on the electoral agenda generally.  It is not possible to comment on all points but I will respond to some of the issues raised.  We can examine matters relating to the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.I welcome the comments of Deputies Terence Flanagan, Ciarán Lynch and Cuffe, who acknowledged the integrity and independence of the Constituency Commission.  I express thanks to the members of the Constituency Commission.  I welcome the cross-party consensus evident in the debate in support of the commission process, particularly in respect of implementing the constituency revisions provided for in the Bill.  It is vital that we work together on electoral matters as they are central to the functioning of democracy in this country.Some Deputies have difficulties with specific recommendations of the commission and we understand these concerns.  We must bear in mind that constituency formation is not a perfect science and people do not live in areas that allow for constituencies to be drawn up that meet with general approval.  The overriding constitutional requirement of equality of representation means breaches of obvious boundaries are unavoidable in certain cases.In examining the commission's recommendations the Minister is in the same position as every other Member.  I do not have any information beyond what is set out in the report.  Somebody's interest must be affected in the revision process.  This is the price we must pay for our democratic system.  We agree that the job should be entrusted to a commission.  The commission has done the job that seemed best to it.  Difficult choices had to be made, the available options were marshalled and the commission made informed and reasoned recommendations.  I or other Members may have made a different choice but we cannot fault the commission for that.  Deputy Stanton referred to consultation with eminent former politicians.  The commission carried out its task in compliance with the guidelines issued to it.  I ask the House to accept the report as framed in the Bill.The debate showed the strong attachment to county boundaries.  While this is understandable, the terms of reference of the commission are subordinate to the relevant constitutional provisions, which do not refer to counties.  In O'Donovan v The Attorney General, Justice Budd stated:although a system in the main based on counties has in fact been adopted, there is nothing in the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties.  The Constitution does not say that in forming the constituencies according to the required ratio, that shall be done so far as is practicable having regard to county boundaries.Deputy Enright also referred to provincial boundaries.  There is no absolute prohibition on the breach of county boundaries.  At times the constitutional provisions require such action, difficult though it may be.  The 2007 commission report is no different in this regard.  Deputies Ciarán Lynch, Varadkar, Cregan and others referred to the procedures to be followed by the Constituency Commission in carrying out its report.  As the Minister said in his opening statement, the Bill provides for updated and improved constitutional arrangements, including a minimum of three months for the making of submissions to the commission.  These are important new measures that retain the essential framework that has allowed the commission to operate effectively over many years.I urge people to engage with the submission process to the maximum extent rather than waiting until after the commission has reported to express their views.  I have no doubt we will be engaging with these matters further in the course of our consideration of the Bill.Deputies referred to local authority constituencies.  On 16 June 2008 the Minister received the reports of the two boundary committees established in January to review local electoral areas.   The reports were published on 17 June 2008 and the Minister announced that he was accepting the recommendations contained in both of them.  The necessary statutory orders giving effect to the recommendations of the committee, which are a key element of the legislative framework governing the forthcoming elections, are currently being prepared in the Department and will be finalised over the coming weeks.  I expect the process to be completed by early November.Deputies Lynch, Clune and Bannon referred to the need for the establishment of an electoral commission.  The House will be aware that the programme for Government contains a commitment regarding the establishment of an independent electoral commission which will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight, implement modern and efficient electoral practices, revise constituency boundaries, take charge of compiling a new national rolling electoral register, take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission that relate to election spending and examine the issue of financing the political system.The establishment of an electoral commission will be a major body of work.  Issues arising for consideration will include international best practice, the commission's structure and functions, to whom it reports, its relationship with other bodies currently involved, and the approach to be followed regarding the extensive legislation required.  My Department has appointed consultants to research the issues arising in respect of the establishment of the commission and to make recommendations on the way forward.  The consultants' work is well under way and will be completed shortly.  This will be an important input to future Government decisions in this area.A number of Deputies referred to the register of electors.  In law, the preparation of the register is a matter for each local registration authority whose duty it is to ensure as far as possible, and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.  In working to compile the register for 2007-2008 local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades.  On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register, compared to previous years.  The task now for local authorities regarding the register for 2009-2010 is to maintain and build on the progress made to date.  My Department will bring in an advertising campaign to encourage people to check that they are on the register.  This will start in the coming weeks.  The draft register for 2009-2010 will be available from 1 November for checking and follow-up action.  Individuals who are not on the register can, of course, avail of the supplement to the register until 15 days before the next polling day.Beyond the immediate future, I welcome the recent report of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the future of the electoral register in Ireland, and related matters.  The report is consistent with the commitment contained in the programme for Government to establish an electoral commission with responsibilities to include the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register to which I have already referred.A number of Deputies commented positively on the proposals in the Bill regarding nominations.  Regulating access to the electoral process is a common feature in most parliamentary democracies and is widely seen as necessary to discourage too large a number from contesting an election.  The proposals in the Bill strike the right balance between providing for a reasonable test of the bona fidesof a prospective candidate and not setting that test so high as to unduly restrict people from seeking election.  Candidates standing who are not in possession of a certificate of political affiliation will now be able to choose which option best suits their own circumstances.  This may require the completion of statutory declarations at a centre in the constituency which may be witnessed by a commissioner of oaths, peace commissioner, a notary public, a garda or a local authority official, or it may require the lodgement of a deposit with the returning officer before the deadline for receiving nominations.  This represents a significant improvement on the previous arrangements and I am satisfied it fully meets the constitutional requirements.I stress again the Government's and my own view that the Constituency Commission's recommendations are a package which must be accepted or rejected in the entirety.  The Government has decided to follow the established practice of implementing in full the recommendations of the independent commission.  This is the best way forward.I thank the Deputies for their contributions and I look forward to further debate on these important issues when we return to the Bill on Committee Stage.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Broadcasting Bill.  I am sure the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, will appreciate that while I hold the very best estimation of his character and personality, he will not misinterpret it when I say I found the introduction of the Second Stage of this Bill to be somewhat disappointing.What I bring to the Bill is a perspective from my own experience as a former Minister with responsibility for broadcasting and as president of the Council of Broadcasting Ministers of the European Union in 1996.  I express disappointment because of the absence of a consideration of the values of broadcasting and some fundamental choices.  In the time allowed to me I can go through these only cursorily.The first issue that arises for any Minister with responsibility for broadcasting concerns how he or she views the population to which broadcasting services are addressed.  I can put this simply and starkly.  They can be constituted as consumers or as citizens.  It is this balance that is always at stake, the preservation of the concept of citizenship within broadcasting.  As put by people from Lord Reith onwards, this is the right of people to talk to each other.  In other words, broadcasting was defined as a community in conversation with itself.  By definition, that is enormously inclusive and has implications for policy, for example, the right of minorities to be represented, the right of both genders to be represented and the right and the duty of broadcasters, as Lord Reith's original description expressed it, to educate, inform and entertain.I find it necessary to say that public service broadcasting is now not merely challenged, as many write concerning it, but is seriously degraded.  I make another distinction, that which lies between the role of a public service broadcaster and what one might call a sprinkling of public service broadcasting.  When I was Minister I went through all these arguments.  Often people would say to me concerning a commercial station that gave news about weather, deaths and funerals that such material was surely public service broadcasting.  Of course this is part of the remit of a public service broadcaster — it is an aspect of public service broadcasting.Therefore, a distinction is made between the role of the public service broadcaster, which in this case is also a State broadcaster, RTE, supported by the licence fee with certain obligations, and those people who might be performing a public service function.  There is a crucial difference.  I spent a great deal of my time as a Minister, and it was a great privilege to be Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, a Department that was wrecked after I left, in a rather vindictive sense.  It was a great honour to be introduced to the Council of Ministers in Europe and to be president of the Council of Broadcasting Ministers and Audio-visual Ministers, to have the Department represented there and to be introduced as "the Minister for Culture".  It was the first time that Ireland had been represented.  The Ceann Comhairle will not be embarrassed if I say that he was a distinguished successor of mine in this role.I have described what is happening in broadcasting in Ireland and Europe as a degradation of the public service broadcasting ethic.  It is so in a most comprehensive sense.While I cannot defend everything I have ever written, I have written about this subject.  My last book, Causes for Concern: Irish Politics, Culture and Society, which was published in 2006 by Liberties Press, contains a chapter based on a lecture I gave in New Zealand when the future of its broadcasting licence was under discussion.  That chapter could be summarised as the decline and fall of public service broadcasting.  It has declined in every sense.  It has declined in respect of the application of technology for the benefit of all the people.  I mean that universal access as a principle is less than it once was.  As for attempts to balance what I described as issues of the population as consumers or as citizens, it has swung over heavily to the side of the population as consumers.  I also argue something that I am free to state clearly at my age, namely, that among broadcasting practitioners, there also has been a lessening of practice.  One cannot compare celebrity culture, which exists as an alternative, to the fine moments of broadcasting, even in the Irish sense, of the past.I should state immediately that the Irish broadcaster always has had a fine standard next door to it.  Irish broadcasting was built on a comparison with, for example, the standards of the BBC service, which is one of the great broadcasters of all time.  Moreover, Irish broadcasting regularly surpassed that standard.  However, when one has a station in which people ape commercial programmes brought from across the Atlantic and end up rather pathetically interviewing themselves as celebrities, it is both incestuous and cheap.  As for news, current affairs and so forth, it is frightening to think that the new technology in which television is a hot medium is one whereby coverage has changed entirely, in so far as the requirement to have a context for the news that is current has disappeared.  The suggestion, for example, that the elaboration of an opinion now is no longer possible but that one must offer sound bites rather than the presentation of an argument and so forth also is frightening.  This reveals both a change in broadcasting and a change in broadcasting practice.The finest book about Irish broadcasting that was ever published is Sit Down and Be Counted — the Cultural Evolution of a Television Station, with its introduction by Raymond Williams.  The book’s editors and contributors, Bob Quinn, Lelia Doolan and the late Jack Dowling, were people who were at the cusp of something that was extremely important in respect of the history of Irish broadcasting.  They took their stand because they wanted to defend the right of the programme maker with regard to broadcasting values and norms against the administrative direction of programming that later would collapse into being a commercially-led venture.  It also is interesting that the person who wrote the book’s preface, the late Raymond Williams, entitled his last paper, “How to be the arrow, not the target”.  In so doing, he was pointing to the value of citizenship and the right, for example, of citizens to participate.  While Lord Reith’s values have been described somewhere else as a kind of authoritarian paternalism, they were sound broadcasting values.  It was the acceptance of the obligation of being able to allow several narratives to be present at the same time and to be treated with respect.I find it extraordinary that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would sail in with the Broadcasting Bill on Second Stage without making a single reference to any such issues pertaining to values.  It may be that the values of which I speak are out of date in these cheapened times.  I defend my statements in the Green Paper I published on broadcasting when I held office as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the statements I made before the European Parliament as Minister with responsibility for broadcasting and culture and elsewhere.  I contrast such statements with the Minister's up-beat presentation on Second Stage to the effect it is great to be here fixing up all the technical bits and pieces.This is a Bill of substance that contains good measures.  However, if one examines its definitions section to ascertain what is public service broadcasting, the answer is that RTE is a public service broadcaster.  While other Members can tease this out for themselves, how satisfactory is it to produce such a Bill?  This is akin to asking what is a hen and receiving the reply that a Rhode Island Red is a hen.  It is meaningless.  There is no definition of public service broadcasting in the Bill.  It only goes as far as stating that RTE is a public service broadcaster.  That is about as valuable as stating that something that lays an egg might be a hen.  It contains no definition and does so by entirely escaping all of the tedious matters about which people are commenting and that I propose to repeat to an extent.My views in this regard are not only held by me.  I refer to further issues that were not discussed in the Minister's Second Stage speech.  What is happening in broadcasting globally?  Ownership is being concentrated.  Does this not matter?  Does it not matter, for example, that an oligopoly operates in respect of product?  Does it not matter that approximately 85% of all the games that are watched by children and teenagers in Europe are produced by a single company?  Does it not matter that Berlusconi, Rupert Murdoch and others dominate the airwaves?  Was it not of cultural significance that Mr. Berlusconi crossed over from television and radio to establish monopolies in the print media?  Is cross-ownership not important?  The issue of concentration of ownership and cross-ownership and its effect within a culture was not worth a single sentence in the introductory speech on Second Stage.I will turn to the next big issue, namely, the merging of technologies.  I called this a convergence of technologies 11 years ago, when one was able to talk about concentration of ownership and convergence of technologies, by which I meant that one was facing into the digital age and also was dealing with new forms of electronic capacity with regard to broadcasting.  This was not mentioned either.  I will turn to a matter that was going to be most important, namely, the fragmentation of audiences, driven on by commercial pursuits.  Members should recall that Rupert Murdoch stated he would use sport as the battering ram, as he made his way towards the destruction of television.  While Members may not be able to do much about this in an Irish item of broadcasting legislation, it is a sad day when the issue does not even surface in the debate and is missing from the Minister's speech.I have stated there are positive aspects to the Minister's speech, to which I now will turn.  I welcome the idea of a channel that will cover the proceedings of the Oireachtas.  That proposal fits well with my suggestions in respect of accepting the importance of a discourse that is based on principles of citizenship.  It is good that this proposal is contained in the Bill.  It also is good that there is a recognition of the importance of Bord Scannán na hÉireann — The Irish Film Board, the film industry and its future possibilities.  However, I simply state that the philosophical underpinnings of the reason Ireland has a public service broadcaster are missing.  I suspect that none of my observations necessarily is partisan.  When I became a Minister and attended meetings in Europe, I was the only Minister attending the Council of Ministers who was in favour of public service broadcasting.  During the years from 1993 to 1997, everything was going the other way and was going commercial.  At home, I was fighting a battle, with support from all sides and parties in the House, to establish a new aspect of public service broadcasting, that is, what then was Teilifís na Gaeilge.  However, I was opposed by those who had a vested interest in oligopoly and monopoly in newspapers.  The Sunday Independent ran a disgraceful campaign against the concept of Teilifís na Gaeilge and public service broadcasting, and it was directed heavily against me.  Individual journalists would later describe TnaG as Teilifís DeLorean and so forth.  Against the grain I was establishing and extending public service broadcasting consciously because I believed in it.  That is why I feel it necessary to speak now when I see public service broadcasting dragged down into a pit of commercialism and broadcasting practice at its lowest ebb.On the other side there is the very interesting issue of what happens when the values of broadcasting are not set out as they should be.  Broadcasters lose confidence, as so many did when I was dealing with that other controversial matter, the order under section 31 prohibiting the appearance of certain organisations on the airwaves.  A third of the organisation felt it could relax under that section and it made life easy as they did not have to take on the burden of what I had argued, that if we wanted to deal with subversion and threats to the State, we would do it in public order legislation.  We were not to use broadcasting legislation with a purpose for which it should never have been used and which would deteriorate into an instrument of censorship.I remember members of the Progressive Democrats, when they were opposite, standing up and saying how the results of my action would be that everybody would join the IRA and denying there was any aspect of censorship involved.  I held my views on that broadcasting issue since the time of a very fine intellectual debate between Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien and myself in the Seanad in the 1970s.  We laid out our different positions and I respect that.There must be a debate in what broadcasting is for, who should have access and the space that is broadcasting.  It is necessary to make the technical arrangements but they are instrumental to the bigger issue.  I recall that after I left in 1998 once again we went through another cataclysm about how digitalisation would happen.  I should tell the Minister, in case he forgets with the airbrush approach that the Green Party has to history, that it was in June 1998 that then Minister, Síle de Valera, announced that the Government had taken a decision at Cabinet on the form of the introduction of digital technology.  A debate then appeared on the sidelines as to whether it should be a commercial venture and the role of Radio Teilifís Éireann.It is now ten years later and everything in the "Happy Happy" Ministry is hunky dory.  It is all a matter of, gee whiz, everything is so technical, shiny, beautiful and so forth.  It reminds me more of an approach to broadcasting that is like somebody going into a toyshop.That brings me to another issue which did not surface, that of direct advertising to children.  It is very interesting that the toy manufacturers of Europe would hold conferences in London and hire psychologists and lobbyists to ensure no parliament in Europe would even dream of forbidding the advertising of toys to children in certain circumstances.  That does not arise.  It is not just the Labour Party spokesperson on broadcasting who would be interested as many decent Members are concerned with the issue of protecting children against the predation of those who have no standards with regard to commercial advertising.This is a Second Stage speech but I have many detailed submissions to make on Committee Stage regarding different sections.

I was Minister with the relevant portfolio from 1993 to 1997.  On Tuesday, 21 September 1993, François Mitterrand gave a speech, having received an honorary doctorate from the University of Gdansk, in which  he stated:We must be on our guard.  Although the spirit of Europe is no longer threatened by the great totalitarian machines which we have successfully withstood or by war, it could be more insidiously endangered by new masters, namely economism, mercantilism, the power of money, and in a certain way, technology.  Just think of the tremendous impact which audio-visual media are having in our lives.He went on to state:So I ask the question, can media ratings and commercial profit override the demands of thought and ethics without serious consequences?  Europe has generally been successful in reconciling the freedom to engage in business with the freedom to create, the expansion of wealth and the development of the arts and ideas, competitiveness and our national identities.He continued:It was no joy to me to know that I did not succeed in holding back the sea of American domination in European culture.  What do our American partners want?  They want to include the production and distribution of images in the general agreement.He went on to raise the question of why should we be so dominated.  What are our broadcasters doing to establish something that is distinct?  Mitterrand quoted Jean Claude Carrière in arguing:Imagine if the Germans were to say to the Irish "You listen to Bach and Beethoven far more often than your own composers, so just stop making music.  And if the French said to the Portuguese "You read Balzac and Proust more than your own authors, so you should stop writing".The idea that a Minister would give a Second Stage speech and not introduce any of the issues I mentioned fills me with great despair and disappointment.  Broadcasting is located within culture and culture has to do with citizenship.  To have a long elaborate statement of how all the technical adjustments will be made to what is essentially a commercial ethos, without discussing these issues, is a source of sadness.  I will return in detail to all these issues on Committee Stage.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I do not have any quotes to match those so I will stick to the basics.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which had over 420 submissions during the consultation process.  Notwithstanding the comments of Deputy Higgins, it is a positive Bill which will clearly change the shape of broadcasting in Ireland.Some of the main points may not address the concerns of Deputy Higgins but they make a positive contribution to broadcasting.  The new and overarching broadcasting authority of Ireland will address much of the concern that viewers and citizens have with public and private broadcasters.  The introduction of sanctions of up to €250,000 for licence and code infringements is a positive move.  Previously, the BCI had to take what was the drastic option of revoking a licence for a code or licence infringement.  That the punishment will be staggered and the penalty will suit the crime is probably a good step.The establishment of audience councils is a positive move.  Two new stations will be set up, Oireachtas TV and the Irish film channel.  I will come back to the Oireachtas TV channel in a moment.I have a number of observations to make on the ban on the advertising of junk food aimed at children.  With recent figures indicating that almost 300,000 Irish children are affected by obesity, it is clear that addressing the problem will be a major challenge for society, especially parents.I read in one of the submissions on the legislation that while carbohydrate intake has not increased in the past ten years, exercise levels have declined significantly.  If people eat more and exercise less, it will clearly have a knock-on effect in terms of the rate of obesity.  As a parent and someone who is involved with local sporting groups, I believe addressing the problem of obesity is best done through parental and school involvement rather than in the media.  When children are active and involved in local activities it has a positive impact on reducing obesity.The ongoing development of sports facilities must be maintained.  The Ceann Comhairle in a previous life did much to address the shortage of sporting facilities.  This has made a major difference in all sections of the community, whether elite athletes or those who wish only to participate in sport.  One problem we face is to persuade parents to stay and become involved in clubs and activities rather than dropping off their children or using sports facilities as crèches.The decision to introduce a ban on junk food advertisements aimed at children is a positive step but no more than a tiny piece in the jigsaw in terms of our efforts to tackle obesity.  Deputy Coveney lamented the fact that a restriction similar to the ban on junk food advertising does not apply to alcohol advertisements.  I agree that this is a missed opportunity and I hope the proposed broadcasting authority of Ireland will have the power to introduce strong measures to restrict the advertising of alcohol on television.  I hope the Minister will examine this issue and, if necessary, beef up the authority's powers in this area.  In saying this, I do not seek to detract from the positive measures in the legislation.The Ceann Comhairle has led the way in making the Houses of the Oireachtas more accessible to members of the public. While I have no doubt that an Oireachtas television challenge makes sense in theory and will, in time, become necessary, I am not convinced that such a channel is currently required.  Knowing that this legislation was pending, over the past week I asked a number of people whether they had ever followed contributions in the House live on the Oireachtas website.  Not one of those whom I asked had visited the website to watch the live feed of proceedings and many of them were not aware that it was possible to do so.  For this reason, it may be preferable to raise public awareness of available services before we seek to establish an Oireachtas television channel.  Our current media infrastructure, specifically the RTE, TG4 and TV3 television channels, are the appropriate vehicle for improving the connection between the Oireachtas and members of the public.  At this point, the establishment of a new channel would amount to a duplication of services.  Perhaps someone will provide a technical reason showing that a new channel would not generate additional costs.People are not ready for an Oireachtas television channel.  "Oireachtas Report" is a top-class, professional programme.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I hope it will have a large audience.Although "Oireachtas Report" is a high quality production, it is shown at such a late hour that only insomniacs and political anoraks watch it.  People are sometimes right to accuse Members of living in a bubble, especially if we believe many people watch "Oireachtas Report".  The programme should be moved to a slot earlier in the evening or presented as an item in the afternoon schedule.Many people would be interested in watching "Oireachtas Report".  For this reason, its remit should be extended to include regular rather than occasional coverage of proceedings in the European Parliament.  Deputy Coveney will understand better than most of us that drawing attention to European issues is a difficult task, particularly in the wake of the difficulties we experienced with coverage of the Lisbon treaty campaign.  It is important that proceedings in the European Parliament are given greater coverage.  Given that news programmes feature country round-ups, why is it not possible to broadcast a summary of proceedings in the Oireachtas or European Parliament each evening?We have not used up all available resources to maximise the connection between the Houses and members of the public.  As the resounding success of recent open days showed, many people have a keen interest in the work of the House.  Public interest will not increase overnight but over time and in incremental steps.  The Oireachtas channel is a step too far at this point.  It would be akin to fitting an ashtray to a motorbike in that it would look great but would not be practical.On the establishment of an Irish film channel, I am not a great fan of television.  As a radio person who does not watch much television, I may be biased.  Nevertheless, the Bill will make a difference in this regard and it is good to examine all the options available to us.I share other speakers' concern about the ban on advertisements for religious vocations.  A large number of people find comfort and solace in religion.  During the summer I was fortunate to be able to travel to Gambia in western Africa with Voluntary Service Overseas where I met a Holy Ghost Father from Blackrock, Bishop Bobby Ellison.  He has spent more than 40 years there, quietly, gently and efficiently getting on with making a difference in people's lives.  Gambia and other countries in Africa have gone through a great deal of turmoil but through all that the Holy Ghost Fathers and Bishop Ellison, in his work, have made a positive difference.  Bishop Ellison's work has been a cornerstone on which improvements have been made within Gambian society. He has made an incredible contribution to that society.  It is amazing that an order such as the Holy Ghost Fathers cannot advertise on television for religious vocations.  The members of the order get on with their work.  They are quiet, non-intrusive and constructive in the work that they do in Africa and elsewhere across the globe, work of which we should be proud.However, when it comes to Ireland, people here consider we have become a modern society and television advertisements for religious vocations are old-fashioned.  Deputy Higgins made the comment that perhaps he is part of that old valued world.  The banning of advertisements for religious vocations is a backward and retrograde step and such advertising should be permitted in the context of this Bill.The Minister has a chance to break the cosy cartel that appears to operate in broadcasting media.  I  very much welcome his decision, for the first time in the history of the State, to facilitate an Oireachtas committee, the Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to nominate four members to the board of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and four members each  to the boards of RTE and TG4.  That is a positive move because it provides a link between the work of this House and the committee with the broadcasting sector.  Many people may criticise the committees and say that they do not do this or that, but this is a visionary move by the Minister to empower a committee with a degree of influence and a central role in the decision-making process.  His decision to allow the committees appoint such members is positive.I ask that he takes the lead in such board appointments and in the appointment of members to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I would like him to set an example by appointing not the usual suspects but people who will challenge us.  I do not mean that they would agree with everything we say but that they would challenge us in a positive way and stimulate debate within the broadcasting sector.  There is, in many ways, a lack of debate within the sector.  By appointing people who would be challenging, that would have an impact on the ongoing development of this process, namely, the change the Minister is seeing through.I would like the Minister to appoint ordinary people from around the country.  We all know and meet people through our day to day work who would make ideal members of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, but  we know that they would never be appointed to it.  However, I would like people who work within the community or are involved in community groups or industry and know people's views on various issues to be considered in this respect.  Referring to the Lisbon treaty, many people within the broadcasting sector were detached from the views of ordinary people.  That was reflected in the coverage of that debate and the way issues were handled, but I acknowledge other issues affected the type of coverage it received.However, there is a group in society who are detached from the views of the vast large majority of people on various issues.  That group lives in a bubble and, therefore, it is important that members who will challenge issues are appointed to these boards.  I refer to people such as Senator Ronan Mullen and David Quinn, with whom I disagree on many issues.  They would challenge views and create good debate, and that is what we need.  We need people who will challenge us, the establishment and cosy cartel in society.  There is a segment in society who look down on our traditional values and on people who hold values that are not considered cool, trendy and modern.  We need to not look down on them but to engage and debate with them.I hope the Minister will set an example in his selection of members and ensure that this Bill will work as well in practice as it does in theory.  In theory, this is a good Bill and it will make a big difference to the broadcasting sector and to society, but it must also work in practice.  I hope the Minister, in his appointments, will make this Bill work in practice.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I was struck by Deputy Higgins's contribution.  Not blowing too much sunshine his way, he is one of the last great orators in this House.  We got an example of that today when we heard his views and passion for public service broadcasting.  I have many proposals and views on the detail of the Bill that I would like the Minister of State to convey to the Minister.  I understand the reason he is not here, with which I have no difficulty.  However, it is appropriate at the start of a Second Stage contribution to focus, emphasise and reflect on the fact that we are asked why public service broadcasting and regulation of broadcasting outside the public service sphere is important.  The answer to that question is that as a country changes, grows and transforms, as Ireland has done during the past ten years, if we respect a core value system for a people, country or community, we must figure out ways of keeping that value system alive, supporting and cherishing it and informing new people and communities as they join this country and our people about what Irishness and Ireland are all about.Broadcasting is the most effective media by far to do that.  That is why public service broadcasting is so important in Ireland today.  As our country has been transformed during the past two decades, we need to use the tools available to us to keep in perspective what is important in this country.  Public service broadcasting, in particular, plays a hugely valuable role in that regard.On Committee Stage, perhaps we might tease out what we want from organisations such as RTE in respect of how they spend public money in the pursuit of an agenda which relates to cherishing what Ireland is and to our future aspirations for it.  We might also consider how we could support this in a non-commercial way.  We must, however, take into account the commercial realities and acknowledge the competition RTE faces from other broadcasters and from the other technologies that can inform people and influence their views.I welcome the Bill, which will bring about much needed change in the area of broadcasting.  The new structures it will introduce, namely, the broadcasting authority of Ireland, BAI, and the two sub-committees relating thereto, make some sense.  If, however, we were starting afresh — we are not doing so — it would make sense to consider creating the post of communications regulator rather than having ComReg and a broadcasting regulator.  Ofcom, the communications regulator in Britain, deals with matters such as the roll-out of broadband facilities, IT infrastructure, telecommunications, mobile telephone technology etc., but it also deals with broadcasting matters.  Such a model makes sense.Many people watch their televisions or are informed, in a broadcasting sense, via computer screens, mobile telephones or some form of personal digital assistant, PDA.  There is going to be a great deal of co-operation and links between ComReg and the BAI.  It would have made sense to consider creating a super-regulator for the area of communications, under which those two organisations would have been united, rather than establishing an entirely new structure.  My remarks are particularly relevant in the context of trying to streamline matters by reducing the number of quangos and State-sponsored bodies in existence.I wish to comment on the effect the Bill will have in respect of a series of areas and perhaps the Minister can reflect on what I have to say before Committee Stage.  I appreciate from where the Minister is coming in respect of appointments to the new boards of the BAI, RTE and TG4.  I welcome the fact he is recognising that the way the Government appoints members to State boards is wrong, inappropriate, overly political and, at times, corrupt.  It is often a reward system for people who have supported a particular political party in government.  I am not stating that people who have been appointed to boards relating to broadcasting in the past have been corrupt.  I am merely highlighting that the principle which allows a Minister to make decisions on appointments without any form of oversight is inappropriate.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, recognises that in the Bill.  However, his proposed solution will not solve the problem.It is not the role of an Oireachtas committee to put forward nominees to be appointed to the board of the BAI.  It is the responsibility of such a committee to interview a panel of people whose names have been put forward by the Minister.  That committee should vet these individuals, ensure they are suitable for and capable of performing the duties to which they will be appointed and have some say in approving those who will serve as the members and chairperson of the board.  If this does not happen, the status quo will remain.  There will be Members who will know individuals with whom they have relationships and whom they believe might like to be on the boards of the BAI or RTE.  That will come through the system.I would prefer if the Minister chose people in a non-partisan or non-political way and then charged the relevant committee with assessing their suitability to serve.  If they come through this process, such individuals could then be appointed.  That is the kind of structure with which Fine Gael would be more comfortable.  It is the job of the Government to fill State boards; that is what it is elected to do.  However, it is the job of the Oireachtas and its committees to offer oversight and ensure Ministers do not abuse their position.  That is what the committee should be charged with doing.  Fine Gael will table an amendment on Committee Stage to try to change the position in this regard.I welcome the section relating to enforcement and sanctions, which is extremely sensible in nature.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland cannot sanction a broadcaster if it breaks the rules, breaches codes of conduct or whatever.  The only sanction it has, namely, that it can revoke a licence, is nuclear in nature.  There must be a system of lesser sanctions by means of which fines can be imposed and the necessity of going to court can be avoided.  That is a sensible proposal and it will be receiving our support on Committee Stage.I wish to make a number of points regarding the codes and rules.  Members who are involved in dealing with this legislation have been the subject of much lobbying in respect of it.  They have been lobbied by the industry with regard to threatened bans on junk food and alcohol advertising and various other matters.  Fine Gael takes an uncompromising approach to protecting children, young people and adults from irresponsible advertising.  We should not, however, be attempting to introduce heavy-handed measures, such as bans or whatever.  We should instead be conferring power onto the new broadcasting authority of Ireland to be heavy-handed if the necessity arises.  The authority should be obliged to come before an Oireachtas committee or seek ministerial approval before introducing new measures relating to codes of conduct, punishment etc.Will the Minister equip the proposed broadcasting authority of Ireland to introduce those measures that are necessary in respect of alcohol advertising, junk food advertising or any other form of advertising, be it relating to children's toys or whatever?  If he does so, we will be able to assess, from year to year, the abuses taking place through the medium of advertising on television and address them in as tough a way as is necessary in order to force change within the industry.  It would be far more suitable to proceed in this way rather than try to legislate in respect of bans.  The Minister probably recognises that.  As matters stand, the Bill only proposes that the BAI will have the capacity to introduce a ban on the advertising of unhealthy foods.  It must be more broad-ranging than that.  We should apply to alcohol advertising the same value system that applies in respect of junk food and other irresponsible forms of advertising.It is completely hypocritical to insist on a ban on all religious advertising when also allowing the Angelus to be shown before "Six One" or permitting "A Prayer at Bedtime" to be shown at night.  Is Ireland becoming so politically correct that it is not possible to allow someone to advertise the sale of a crib at Christmas?  That is the point we have reached.  I accept the need to ensure there is not incitement to hatred through advertising or that the aggressive promotion of any one religion does not occur.  Ireland is a secular state, but it is also Christian, Celtic, multicultural and multi-religious.  It is an open, liberal country and it should permit advertising by any church as long as such advertising is tolerant and reasonable.  Let us try and adopt a sensible approach rather than take the politically correct attitude that we are secular and therefore cannot allow any promotion of Catholicism, religion, or Islam for that matter.  Let us try and introduce some flexibility that will allow sensible, tolerant advertising where appropriate.A number of elements of the Bill relating to licensing have been welcomed by independent radio licence holders in the context of introducing a pragmatic sensible measure that will fast-track the renewal of licences.  The current system is ridiculous in that anybody who has had a licence for ten years must, despite the fact nobody contests that licence, go through a long, expensive procedure to renew the licence.  Even though it is only a formality, it costs the radio station a fortune.  I am glad this Bill will get over that.There are issues with regard to the length of time for which new licenses will be granted and there is deliberate positive discrimination in favour of broadcasters who will offer a digital radio platform.  I understand what the Minister is trying to do in this regard, but I am not sure he is doing enough.  We need an honest debate about digital radio.  Currently, unless I am misinformed, digital radio is going nowhere.  If we want to promote digital radio here, we will have to consider promoting it more aggressively than in the Bill.I welcome the section that allows a right of reply to someone whose good name is called into disrepute on a radio or television programme.  However, I want the Minister to go further.  The right of reply should apply with regard to people who have died.  There is an anomaly in Irish law with regard to the defence of the good name of someone who is dead.  Obviously, dead people cannot defend themselves, but neither can their family defend their good name in law.  We have an opportunity to address this issue from the broadcasting point of view in this legislation.  In other words, if someone dies in tragic circumstances and the media gets the story wrong — unfortunately, we had such a case when a member of the Government party died some time ago — the family should automatically have the right of reply.  The family should be allowed reply on the programme of the broadcaster that abused its position.  I urge the Minister to deal with this issue.With regard to the proposed new television stations, this plan has not been thought out or costed and is unworkable as proposed.  A new Irish film channel and an Oireachtas channel are proposed.  The transmission of each of these channels would cost €750,000 alone, not to mind production and other costs.  We need to rethink this plan.  If we are to have a film channel, that I anticipate will cost more than €1 million annually, we must consider how we can fund it.  We do not want Oireachtas and film channels that cost a fortune and that nobody watches apart from a small group of people involved in the sector.  That is nonsense.In the case of film, public service broadcasting must be about bringing Irish film and how it is made and Irish talent to the masses.  We can discuss the Oireachtas channel another time, but if we are to have a film channel we should get RTE to use one of its digital channels as an Irish movie channel.  Let us allow RTE show blockbusters and a set quota of Irish films, documentaries and animated programmes.  In that way we could introduce large audiences to Irish film.  We should also allow advertising for it.  It makes sense in terms of paying for it and in terms of getting bigger audiences, rather than having a cult 24-hour channel watched by a few thousand people.  I am a fan of Irish film and want to see it on our screens, but it must be done properly.The current method of funding public service broadcasting is flawed.  It is flawed to link television ownership with the funding of public service broadcasting because it is only a matter of time before a television screen is also a computer screen and a vehicle for tele-conferencing and computer games.  It is an entertainment and communication system.  Public service broadcasting needs to move with that.  We sponsor it, therefore, we cannot have a situation where we have an army of people knocking on doors around the country to check if there is a television in the bedroom and whether it is licensed.  This system of funding is inefficient and expensive.  It costs €14 million a year to collect €220 million.  This is not good value.  Up to 15% of people evade the television licence fee, which is unfair on those who pay.Let us examine a more pragmatic way of dealing with the situation.  I suggest we should have household and business broadcast levies so that, for example, hotels with a television in every room would pay a reasonable set charge.  All homes in the country, whether they have a television or not, should pay some contribution towards funding public service broadcasting.  People who do not watch television will use computers or listen to radios.  We must get real about the licence and ensure people pay their fair share, there is no evasion and it does not cost a fortune to collect.  I have serious concerns with regard to how it is proposed to fund the broadcasting authority of Ireland and how the levy will be paid, but will return to that on Committee Stage.On advertising standards, the focus in this debate has been on the quality of advertising and, in particular, abuse of children during advertising time.  We must also consider the programmes to which children are exposed.  How many cartoons or animated films broadcast during children's programme time are from Ireland?  The answer is very few, yet we have some of the top animation studios in the world.  They export cartoons and animated films across the world, yet our broadcasters import the major part of animated programmes from the United States.  The Minister must not look just at advertising, but must also consider the content of the programmes to which Irish children, teenagers in particular, are exposed.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	438	This debate is topical.  Deputy Coveney mentioned religious advertising.  Some weeks ago it was brought to the public's attention that yet another advertisement from a religious organisation had been banned from the airwaves.  This ban highlights once again the need to amend current broadcasting legislation so as to ease the onerous restrictions on religious advertising.  The advertisement in question concerned Veritas and it is worth citing it to demonstrate how innocuous it was.  It read:Come to Veritas for great confirmation and First Holy Communion gift ideas.  Choose from our diverse range of religious and inspirational gifts, including children's literature, prayer books, rosary beads, religious medals and candles.So if you want to give your loved one a spiritual gift that relates to what Holy Communion and confirmation are really about, visit Veritas at Abbey Street.The advertisement went on to list a number of other Veritas locations and invited people to visit the Veritas website.  There is nothing offensive about that advertisement.  This is not the first time a Veritas advertisement met this fate.  Last year an attempt by a station to broadcast an advertisement over Christmas fell foul of the current legislation because it mentioned the word "crib".  Clearly, this is absurd.These bans are being imposed on two grounds, both of which are set out in section 41 of the Bill.  The first is that no advertisement directed towards a religious end can be broadcast, while the second prohibits advertisements which address the merits or otherwise of belonging to a particular religion.  Only religious publications and events are exempt from this legislation.  In 2002, however, an advertisement for The Irish Catholic was banned because it mentioned a feature series entitled The Good the Church Does, which concerned the work done by organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.The most recent Veritas advertisement which somehow made it to air on RTE in April was reported to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission by a member of the public and in the middle of September the BCC upheld the complaint based on the above-mentioned legislative grounds.  Specifically, it deemed that describing rosary beads and prayer books as "spiritual gifts" fell foul of the law, as did mention of the Veritas website because it made the link between Veritas and its owners, the Catholic bishops.  Any reasonable person would have to agree this is an overly strict and literal interpretation of the law.The legislation also bans advertisements directed towards a political end but advertisements for secular newspapers are permitted all the time, even though such advertisements often have highly politicised content.  For example, a recent advertisement for Village magazine referred to the lies of the European Union.  The drafters of the current law cannot have imagined that it would be interpreted so as to ban advertisements that mentioned cribs or gifts for First Holy Communion.  What is happening now is ludicrous and indefensible.The one defence offered in respect of the status quo is that if organisations such as Veritas are allowed to advertise their products, extremist religious groups might be able to gain access to the airwaves.  However, no one fears that if the now defunct Village magazine is allowed to advertise, neo-Nazi publications will also be allowed.  The fears are directed towards religion rather than politics.  When a Christian organisation called Power to Change was banned from the airwaves in 2003, it was allowed to advertise on UTV, which show that the North’s advertising regulations are more liberal than the Republic’s.It is patently clear that the legislation needs to be amended and, with a new Broadcasting Bill before us, we should take the opportunity to do so.  We need to take a more liberal approach to religious advertising and permit any advertisement not deemed harmful to the common good.  In this way extremist organisations can still be kept off the airwaves, while allowing mainstream and long established organisations such as Veritas and The Irish Catholic the same access that secular organisations and publications enjoy.  I urge the Minister to take this into account by amending section 41 of the Bill.I could speak all day about the Bill because I served as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the last Oireachtas.  That committee did extensive work on the process of e-consultation for the Bill.  I welcome the officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, including Mr. Bill Morrissey, who worked extremely hard on it.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, was also a member of that committee.The huge success of independent commercial radio stations in Ireland has been built in a short length of time.  I need not look outside my own county with its three successful radio stations, Cork 96 FM, C103 and Red FM, which broadcast to different sections of the community and give the people of Cork city and county local information, news, music and entertainment.  Their importance is further emphasised when one considers the reduction or cessation of RTE's local services throughout the country, including County Cork.  In excess of 2.5 million people tune in to independent radio stations on a daily basis and the celebration in 2009 of 21 years of independent radio services in Ireland makes it hard to imagine life in Ireland prior to their arrival.I have discussed many aspects of the Bill with representatives of the independent radio sector and people who work in the independent stations in Cork.  I am pleased to say the reaction has been largely positive.  I have a strong interest in the Broadcasting Bill in the light of my involvement in its inception and early stages.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources broke the mould in that regard and I hope it will be a template for future committees when legislation is drafted and discussed.  The history of the Bill stretches back to 2003 when the joint committee, with the assistance of former Senator Kathleen O'Meara, produced a report on the licensing process as experienced by local radio stations.  In January 2007 public hearings allowed interest groups, broadcasters and interested members of the public to comment on the Bill.  The process of e-consultation for legislation was first used in regard to this Bill.Senator O'Meara's report highlighted several areas of concern to the joint committee, including the high cost of radio licence applications, the automatic roll-over of licences for compliant radio stations and the fast-tracking of radio licences for compliant radio stations where there has been no other expression of interest in the licence.  I am glad that Deputy Coveney spoke about that issue.  As Chairman of the joint committee, I considered these three provisions could bring a level of practicality to a costly and time consuming procedure and would benefit both the radio stations and the regulator.I am delighted that the Minister and his officials took on board the recommendations made in Senator O'Meara's report but puzzled as to why certain other provisions were introduced in respect of the granting of a radio licence.  The term of a licence will now be reduced to seven years.  As a business person, I realise that a seven year licence will mean that local radio stations will not be able to form a long-term strategic plan.  This makes it difficult to attract and retain talented staff or justify investment in premises, equipment and staff training.  In essence, such a reduction in the term of licences punishes existing radio stations for the lack of competition.  I ask the Minister to allow the term of a commercial radio licence to remain at ten years, regardless of the number of groups which declare an interest.Digital broadcasting is a reality in Ireland.  Digital television services will be available in every household in the country by 2012.  A large number of houses have already installed the necessary equipment.  During my time as Chairman of the joint committee, I visited London to see what steps were been taken in the United Kindgdom to further the digital cause.  I spoke with practitioners and experts from the BBC and commercial radio stations.  To encourage investment, development and involvement in digital radio services, commercial radio stations in the United Kingdom were offered a 12 year licence extension, with the result that the development and take-up of digital radio services are years ahead of those in Ireland.There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding digital radio services in Ireland.  The shortage of concrete information on technology, carriage on the digital platform and the benefits that digital affords radio broadcasters means that every encouragement needs to be given to broadcasters.  The Minister has offered a contract extension of not more than four years to commercial radio stations which invest in digital radio services.  This is not a sufficient incentive for any commercial broadcaste; I suggest offering a contract extension of not less than seven years would result in a greater level of interest and involvement from the commercial radio sector.I welcome the proposed establishment of a single regulatory body as an open, fair and equitable system for all broadcasters.  However, I have two concerns.  In regard to membership of the authority, the BAI will regulate a diverse sector.  It is vital those who are appointed by the Minister or nominated by an Oireachtas committee to sit on the board have significant knowledge, experience and interest in broadcasting if they are to fulfil their duties to the level that the sector requires and demands.  A board member with industry expertise would be of significant advantage to the authority.  Proof of this can been seen in Mr. Joe O'Brien of RTE news and current affairs who is currently sitting on the RTE authority and Mr. David Tighe of Live 95FM in Limerick who sits on the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, both of whom bring a practical understanding of the issues at hand.  It is important that we strike a correct balance in the composition of these boards and committees.My second concern pertains to finance.  The current economic climate and the upcoming budget forced me to look at the BAI in a new light.  I would like to ensure ongoing built-in scrutiny and examination of the BAI budget are included in the Bill.  Such a mechanism would eliminate the incremental rise in the cost of the regulator.  I recommend to the Minister the suggestion made by the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland that the BAI present a three-year budget to the Oireachtas joint committee for its approval and consent.We have already spoken about section 41 of the Bill which deals with advertising.  The independent radio sector has raised the matter of the provision in the Bill for a maximum of ten minutes of advertising per hour.  This is the same, as Deputies know, as commercial radio stations are currently allowed and is carefully monitored by the BCI.  One more second of advertising than is permitted equates to a breach by the broadcaster in question.  Given the live environment in which radio services operate, with breaking news and live interviews, a degree of flexibility should be built in to the advertising requirements of the Bill.  I suggest the advertising cap be averaged over two consecutive hours.  This would not mean that broadcasters would benefit from an increase in advertising minutes or from extra revenue, but it would eliminate petty breaches and the associated administration requirements, while providing a more free-flowing service for the listener.  I noted with interest the discussions on this topic in the Seanad.  A bone of contention surrounding this section was that of broadcasters overloading particular hours with advertisements when listenership was high in order to gain financially.  I support the proposal of my colleague Senator Jim Walsh that the cap of ten minutes per hour be averaged over two consecutive hours, while maintaining a requirement for a minimum of eight minutes of advertising in any one hour.I have often been on local radio with Neil Prendeville in Cork, fighting hard and almost coming to blows, if I could describe it that way, only to run into news time and subsequently lose my train of thought.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I think Mr. Prendeville is mellowing a little, as he has not fought with me for a while.  However, I will send my regards to him.  He has given us a very tough time on occasions, rightly so, as a broadcaster.Section 8 is a new provision which deals with the membership of the authority, about which my colleague Deputy Andrews spoke, as did Deputy Coveney.  Five people will be nominated by the Government on the advice of the Minister who will nominate four people from names sent to him by the joint committee.  This is a welcome move and a major shift from current Government policy, under which the Minister nominates and appoints all members of State boards and statutory bodies.  I would like this issue to be teased out.  I have not heard much more about it but the Minister of State, Deputy Power, mentioned it at our parliamentary party meeting last night.  How will it work?  Will there be a list of suitable candidates?  Will people be asked publicly to send in CVs?  Will there be advertising?  Will expressions of interest be required?  Is it envisaged that the committee will sift through the CVs in private session before it comes to public hearings and examination of witnesses?  What background will be required?  What will be the make-up of the authority?  What is required to get the balance right?If we are asking people to attend a meeting of the committee, what examination will take place?  Will we be grilling witnesses, similar to the American system under which names are sent either to the Senate or the House of Representatives for scrutiny and examination?  If so, I foresee a major problem.  I discussed this issue recently with Mr. John Bruton, the former leader of Fine Gael, in Washington DC when I was there to examine the committee system in my capacity as Chairman of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen.  As Deputies know, we are compiling a draft report for consideration by the House and the Government.  I asked Mr. Bruton whether we should have a system whereby people nominated to any State board would be sent before a committee.  He said we should be careful because such a system would put people off and they would not put their names forward.  They will not want to serve if they are to be grilled about their suitability at an Oireachtas committee.  Prior to that discussion, I was of the view that we should have the right to interview people.  Mr. Bruton made some very important points, for which I thank him.  I look forward to receiving a submission from him on the whole committee system because he had some very good ideas.I ask the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his officials to consider this issue closely and carefully.  If a list of names is sent to an Oireachtas committee, some people might have political pedigrees, while others might not.  A person may be ridiculed on the floor of the committee, even if he or she was the most qualified for the position, and not recommended by the committee.  I would like to know more about this.  Unfortunately, as I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I will not be able to hear the results.  However, perhaps I will tune in to hear them.I commend the Minister who is probably the most suitable person for the job he holds.  I had the pleasure of working with him for five years on the committee and he was an outstanding member, with outstanding vision and tremendous ideas.  He was most helpful in every report we produced.  Whether it was on fisheries, energy, broadcasting or mobile phones, he had a major input.  I commend him on this Bill and his tweaking of it.  I see his fingerprints all over it in certain areas, which is good.  I have no doubt that during the lifetime of the Government he will do a tremendous job for it, the Oireachtas and the people.How much time do I have left?

We badly need to catch up with the rapidly changing world of broadcasting.There were two defining moments in Irish broadcasting: the setting up of the RTE television station which broadcast for the first time on New Year's Eve in 1961 and the birth of local radio stations in 1988.  Both events changed the face of Ireland.  The power of the broadcaster to shape public opinion and influence the direction of our lives was firmly established.  We are now facing even more rapid changes.  Modern technology provides a multitude of challenges and opportunities that must be met head-on if we are to have the necessary matching legislation to regulate the process.It is to be welcomed that the Bill suggests one authority for broadcasting, replacing the RTE authority and that of TG4, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  The reform in the method of appointing the board is a welcome development, but I support Deputy Coveney's view that it does not go far enough.  Each appointee should be able to demonstrate his or her competence, objectivity and fitness to perform the functions required.  Deputy Coveney went into great detail on how this should be done, but I will say only the change goes some of the way but not far enough.Rather than go through the Bill from A to Z, I will refer to a few points of personal interest in the area of broadcasting.  The switching off of the analogue transmission in 2012 and the oncoming of the digital era in television and radio will have positives and negatives.  The introduction of the Oireachtas channel and the film channel has been mentioned.  On a recent visit to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs by our counterparts from Northern Ireland concerns were raised about this change.  I believe the public are not aware that in 2012 people in the Northern part of our island will need to pay for the reception of the RTE and TG4 channels.  Likewise we will need to pay for the individual BBC and ITV channels.  People should know more about the matter which should be teased out by the North-South Ministerial Bodies well in advance of 2012.  From our perspective the availability of RTE and TG4 channels and radio stations to our people in the Northern part of the country is vital and also an important aspect of cultural life up there.The control of junk food advertising is a good move.  I have no doubt the glamorisation of junk food on our television screens particularly at times when there is a large young audience has played a major part in the increase in obesity in our young people.  In some respects it may be bad that they spend too long watching television in the first place.  However, encouraging them to eat the wrong kinds of foods is another thing.  The authority to do that need not be contained in the Bill.  As previous speakers have said, perhaps it should be regulated by the broadcasting authority.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.There is also need to review regulations for alcohol advertising.  This subject has been debated in the House on many occasions and this is an opportunity to do something about it.  Just as the junk food advertisements need to be banned or regulated strictly during children's programmes the times of alcohol advertising need to be strictly controlled.  For instance, drinks advertisements should not be connected with sports broadcasts particularly if the events involve people at under-age level.  It is totally contradictory to give the impression that the high level of commitment, discipline, fitness and training achieved by these people can be linked to the alcohol products that are advertised or might even be sponsoring the programme.  The sports organisations have rightly been criticised for accepting alcohol sponsorship for major events.  However, these advertisements may be linked to the sports events being broadcast, which needs to be stopped and here is an opportunity to do so.I will comment briefly on the section in the Bill setting up the broadcasting fund at 5% of the licence fee.  As Deputy O'Flynn mentioned, independent broadcasters are constantly complaining of not getting a slice of the licence fee.  Local radio stations, for instance, in the guise of independent and community radio, are providing a wonderful service to their areas.  They are very close to the community and the people feel they can gain access to the broadcasters.  The Gay Byrnes and the Michael O'Hehirs of the 1960s and 1970s in our neck of the woods are now the Tommy Marrens, Joe Finnegans, Willie Hegartys and Mike Finnertys of today.  They are the people identified with at local level.  They can work alongside our national broadcasters and in many ways provide a different type of service.While I accept the independent radio stations are profit-making organisations, in some way it is a two-way process.  Funding could be given to them by providing them with part of the licence fee revenue, which should ensure they provide programming in areas such as documentaries which they do not do at the moment.  Sometimes on these stations the same person reads the news, the death notices, weather forecast and then does a sports commentary.  Quite often the same person will also do some of the advertisements.  That area should be considered.  Nobody could imagine Ireland surviving without these local stations and community broadcasting stations.  Particularly in rural areas, they provide a social service for the people as much as everything else.While I am handing out plaudits, I compliment the former Labour Party Minister, Deputy Higgins, on establishing TG4 some years ago.  The decision was truly visionary.  At the time nobody could have understood the role it would play.  From my involvement in sport I know the role it plays and the wonderful programmes it produces on a shoestring budget.  Every weekend over the winter it broadcasts two or three GAA matches.  It has coverage of tennis from Wimbledon, which has been abandoned by the national channel.  It also broadcasts Eircom League soccer matches — I am not promoting the GAA over the others.  I am talking about the service and how the people feel about it.  It has done more for the Irish language in a way the community did not expect.  I would be concerned over the packages handed out by the sporting organisations to it.  I hope it never gets to a stage where it cannot have access to them because I do not believe any other station could provide the service it does.The Bill overall is welcome and contains many good points.  However, it needs fine tuning which I hope it will get along the way.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Broadcasting Bill 2008, which is welcome.  One of the primary objectives, which I hope will be delivered, is the establishment of the new broadcasting authority of Ireland, a development that has been mooted for some time.  It is great the Bill makes provision for it to happen.  The broadcasting authority of Ireland will in future perform the functions of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  It will also bring RTE and TG4 under its remit.  At present RTE and TG4 are self-regulating and it is good to have one authority regulating and overseeing the functions of broadcasting.  It is a very positive move that has been welcomed across the board.  As previous speakers from my party have said, we would welcome the Minister's recognition that not all appointments to the board would be done politically by the Minister without consultation.  He has made some moves in this regard to ensure the Oireachtas committee will have an overseeing role in appointing members to the board of the BAI.   The Bill provides that five members will be appointed by the Government who will be nominated, while four will be recommended by the Oireachtas committee.  Fine Gael has a different view of how State appointments should be made.  This week we have published a Bill outlining how this should be done, indicating that all ministerial appointments to State bodies should be put before the relevant committee.  I heard Deputy O'Flynn discussing this point and he used the word "grilling".  I do not believe it is intended that any potential member of a board will be grilled.  Individual candidates will certainly be put through their paces and questioned as regards their credentials.  A position such as this, a member of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, must be considered very important and individual candidates should be willing to promote themselves and justify their position.  Certainly, the word "grilling" does not come to mind.  It should be seen as an opportunity for them to promote themselves and justify their proposed appointment in the public domain.  It will be a State board sponsored and supported by the taxpayer.  We shall be tabling an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage and there will be an opportunity to tease matters out and hear the Minister's views.  I have read his comments in the Seanad debate on the matter.I welcome the fact that if a broadcaster infringes the terms of the licence or the requirements of the code, that fines can be put in place, up to a maximum of €250,000.  It is good that fines are being graduated to that high level.  This is a positive step.  Before this, there was no recourse other than to withdraw the licence but nobody wanted to avail of that nuclear option.  Introducing the system of fines is a very positive move.  I also welcome the fact that there will be a speedy right of reply.  Within 15 days somebody can have a  right of reply — at present it can take a long time to obtain redress if somebody believes his or rights have been infringed,  In today's news I see that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland upheld a complaint from a member of the public regarding an item on the Gerry Ryan show in July.  The complaint was upheld, but it has taken almost three months to do so.  When this legislation is in place, it will take just 15 days.  Certainly, this is contentious and there has been some reaction in the media, but having a right of reply within 15 days is a positive step.I want to address the issue of advertising.  The Minister has included a provision in the Bill, whereby the advertising of junk food will be banned or restricted.  I am not sure about this and know it is to be teased out on Committee Stage.  On the face of it, this is a good idea.  While I support the principle, the devil will be in the detail on the question of what constitutes junk food.  One person's idea of junk food may be completely different from another's and I am sure those who produce foods which look exciting on the supermarket shelf or television will have something to say about this because many of us have been the subject of correspondence on the matter.I was interested in a survey conducted by the Consumer Association of Ireland of children's breakfast cereals.  Coco Pops contained 9% fat in Ireland, but only 1.3% in Australia and New Zealand — same box, same brand, same packaging.  Rice Krispies had 13% sugar content here but only 10% in other countries.  The fat levels were 1.3% here but only 0.7% in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.  The figures were defended by the Irish Breakfast Cereals Association and its comments should be noted as regards the claim that there was a nutrition factor in its members' cereals.  However, figures such as these suggest producers of such products might be forced to act, if we look at advertising as it is geared towards children.  They could be permitted to advertise if they keep their sugar, fat and salt levels down.  Perhaps there is a mechanism for addressing the advertising factor because it needs to be done on the basis of these figures.  Producers of such products should be forced to act because we are living in an era where children and adults exercise less and less.  It is an era of fatty and easy food, of which we need to be conscious.I will be interested to hear the debate on Committee Stage as regards the advertising of religious products.  There must be a mechanism around this.  Instead of banning all advertisements for cribs at Christmas, for example, First Holy Communion and confirmation gifts etc., we must be able to allow such advertising provided it does not exceed certain boundaries.  It is ludicrous that all advertising should be banned on the threat of opening the floodgates to extremism.  I do not believe that is in anybody's interest, nor does the general public want it.  Certainly, this can be a dangerous area, but it can be looked at and regulated.  It is another case of not throwing the baby out with the bathwater.On the whole, the most positive step in the Bill is the establishing of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, bringing the regulation of the broadcasting sector under one body.  I look forward to Committee Stage developments and enactment of the Bill.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I congratulate the Minister for bringing forward this comprehensive legislation.  It is both important and influential and deals with a sector of Ireland's social fabric which is constantly changing and updating itself.   It is difficult to believe the strides that have been made in the technology of broadcasting and it behoves us as legislators not only to keep pace but also to try to stay ahead and deal with each new development as it takes place.  In the space of one generation we have come from so-called one-channel land to a modern and fully updated IT society.  Even the most remote households now have access to dozens, if not hundreds, of television channels at the flick of a switch.  Sometimes I wonder if we fully understand or accept the extent of the service available, the access it gives us to worldwide communication and knowledge and the influence it has on our everyday lives.Who could have foreseen a generation ago that not alone would the business of the Dáil and Seanad be broadcast nightly on our television screens, but also the work of the committees?  Now a dedicated Oireachtas channel is being proposed to allow people to tune into the work of either House during the course of the day.  While I do not expect it to have ratings to challenge those of the "X Factor" or "Fair City", it will have a dedicated audience and make for better information and greater transparency for those who have an interest in the affairs of government.  At the very least it may provide an opportunity for insomniacs to catch up on their sleep.On a more serious note, I am pleased that the Bill proposes to combine two State agencies into one, thereby effecting a saving and avoiding unnecessary duplication of work.   The functions of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission will be brought under one umbrella body, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  Having one body fewer to service and finance will result in a payback to the Exchequer.  The benefits will be further enhanced by virtue of the BAI being funded primarily by way of a levy on the broadcasting sector that will result in savings to the Exchequer, which is particularly welcome in the present financial climate.  This is also in line with the Government's goal of reducing the number of such agencies that are State funded, thereby effecting savings, increasing efficiency and modernising the public service bit by bit.  I very much favour the provisions of this Bill but I would like to touch on a few issues.  My reservations are only of a minor nature.In a number of my contributions, I am probably influenced by my local radio station, which has been a huge success, as has the wider local radio service.  While many people consider broadcasting solely in the context of television, radio listenership figures, particularly during the day, tell a different story.  Local radio has had a hugely beneficial effect on provincial Ireland, and rural Ireland in particular, because since the advent of the service, ordinary people have had access to the airwaves.  While there are access programmes on the national stations, people fully air their views on local issues on local radio.I congratulate the local station serving my constituency, WLR-FM, because it provides an excellent local service and runs a truly professional operation.  It has benefited accordingly by being consistently graded in the top few commercial stations in this country.  Listeners throughout the State appreciate the benefits of local radio, having been without such a service until relatively recently, and I am disposed to protecting their interests as much as possible.  Provincial stations provide a much better service by having more local content and dealing with issues that have an immediacy for listeners.I am, however, a little concerned about the fast-track process for radio licences provided for in section 67.  Currently the period of the licence granted is ten years, which is open to competition after that period.  If the holder of the licence is the only applicant, that licensee will be granted a renewal for seven years and not ten.  If there is competition, the successful applicant receives a ten-year licence.  Having regard to the investment required to get a station up and running and to maintain a professional operation, successful applicants should be awarded a ten-year licence.  They need that time to plan ahead and to spread their costs accordingly to obtain a proper return on their investment.  The costs of a station will not be reduced because it is the only contender for the licence.The alternative for a station seeking a licence renewal without competition is to generate artificial opposition not capable of contesting realistically for the licence to qualify for the ten-year term.  That might involve a station from the other end of the country submitting a spurious application to fulfil the requirements of the licensing procedure.  If that were to happen, it would bring the licensing system into disrepute.  The Minister should examine this issue closely as we do not want the system diluted in any way.  It was never intended to punish licence holders seeking to renew their franchise.We are entering the age of digital broadcasting, which opens enormous new possibilities for the industry.  The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland argue that for digital radio broadcasting to be successful, it is vital that all broadcasters use the one format.  For instance, a date has been announced for the switching off of analogue broadcasting for television, which is 2012.  From then on, only a digital signal will be available from RTE and others.  No switch off date for analogue radio has been announced, even though RTE would probably like to know.  It is unlikely, however, that RTE will fully equip for digital broadcasting while its competitors can continue to broadcast without having to make a commitment to major financial investment.  It is a scenario where all or none make the transition and that will have to be introduced in some fashion.The most powerful form of encouragement is an extension of the broadcasting contract for stations that make the transition, as many financial and human resources will be necessary to convert to digital radio.  Currently, a four-year period is proposed, but that is not sufficient, as the investment is not guaranteed to be returned in that time.  A seven-year extension for those stations that will become involved in the provision of a digital service is a more realistic alternative.  The Minister might consider a seven-year extension instead of the proposed four in order not to place any obstacles in the way of the development of this superior service.The BAI and the composition of the membership of the board is innovative in that, for the first time ever in legislation, the joint Oireachtas committee with responsibility for broadcasting will choose and nominate four members of an authority.  This is positive as it represents a good opportunity to achieve countrywide representation rather than a concentration of Dublin members.  The same will hold for the boards of the RTE authority and TG4.  I congratulate the Minister on taking this course, which will have benefits for provincial Ireland and even for rural communities.  Perhaps his colleagues might follow his lead in the future when appointing boards.  Deputy O'Flynn expressed reservations about this provision earlier but these can easily be overcome if the committee conducts its deliberations on appointments in private session.Section 33 proposes the introduction of a levy on broadcasters to fund the BAI and the industry broadly accepts this.  I urge the Minister to be prudent when deciding the levy, as it will, inevitably, have an effect on the amount that can be invested in further development and the changeover to digital.  Funding for operational costs and output may be affected.  The BAI's budget should provide for built-in scrutiny.  The industry has also reasonably requested that it should be given an estimate of what it is expected to pay for the following three-year period.  This is not unreasonable at a time business planning is vital and all commitments into the future should be made known and provided for.  There is no room for this to be foisted on broadcasters at short notice, because they will need to know those of their future commitments which are possible to know as far ahead as possible.I alluded to scrutiny, which the Minister has provided under section 19.  Under this provision, the BAI must report to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of its expenditure and activities.  As a member of the committee, I am fully aware of the tremendous work carried out by its members and the insight they can generate regarding the organisations that appear before them, mainly because of the way the committee is constructed.  The committee is taken more seriously than other committees because of its constitutional status and the successes it has registered over the years.  It is also required that a statement of strategy be produced within six months of the commencement of the authority and every three years thereafter.  This highlights how this body will have to be accountable and this will happen in regard to other agencies in the future.Section 41 provides for a 15% cap on the total daily broadcast time that can be diverted to advertising and a maximum of ten minutes per hour is permitted overall.  No one can quibble with that, as we do not wish to be overwhelmed with advertising.  However, I urge that a little leeway and flexibility be allowed in the overall working of the limits because broadcasting is not an exact science and any number of difficulties could disrupt the schedule and the aggregate time devoted to advertising.  This could be as a result of a breaking news story, a newsflash or the necessity to stay with a particular broadcast or item because of exceptional circumstances.  Currently, the enforcement of this provision is unnecessarily rigid and I urge the Minister to adopt a more flexible approach under the legislation.Section 126 makes provision for the Houses of the Oireachtas to set up a dedicated channel for the broadcast of their deliberations in the various Houses and committees.  This will be made possible through unlimited benefits of digital broadcasting and the lack of boundaries and constraints of the old analogue system.During the coming weekend, in common with a small number of other cinemas around the country and the world equipped for digital screening, the SGC cinema in Dungarvan will show the performance of the Metropolitan Opera of New York live to its patrons through this up-to-the-minute system.  It is a new innovation and, according to the publicity for the event, its roots are as recent as 2006 when the Metropolitan Opera of New York broadcast a live stage performance of Mozart's "The Magic Flute" in high definition in cinemas across the United States.  It was such a success that the entire Met season can now be seen live on cinema screens worldwide, drawing large new audiences to opera.  Opera Ireland, in association with RTE Lyric FM which will also simulcast the performances on radio, is presenting this unique operatic experience to Ireland.  Now an international phenomenon, this is the first time these spectacular high definition live broadcasts from the Met in New York will be seen in Ireland and are sure to be a great addition to operatic life.  This is just one of the great benefits of the digital system and opens up a new frontier to the industry internationally.  These are exciting times in broadcasting and I am glad we are taking advantage of the opportunities presented and proud that the Dungarvan cinema is at the forefront of this new technology.  It seems that if we marry a satellite and a digital link, the possibilities are endless worldwide.Under section 127, the Irish Film Board will establish a free-to-air Irish film channel to exhibit Irish cinematic works.  Sometimes, we do not fully appreciate the products of our film industry which has been able to compete at the highest levels all over the world.  The prizes it has garnered in festivals from Hollywood to Cannes have not come easily but have kept our name among the cinemagoers of the world and in the highest echelons of the business.Another welcome provision is the broadcast funding scheme proposed under section 54.  It will be useful to promote Irish culture in all its forms, helping to counteract some of the less than useful programming from abroad which has little or nothing to offer our population, particularly young people.  I do not see this as protectionism in any way.  Rather, it is a levelling of the playing field in regard to international cultures and a recognition that ours is a rich and varied one, comparable in all its aspects and facets with any other in the world.  Far from what some will say, our culture is well worth preserving and promoting, particularly in a world fast losing any recognisable identity.In my constituency our culture needs little enough help from the State beyond a positive affirmation of the work of many voluntary organisations and some modest funding to enable them to do it.  Coming from a constituency which includes a Gaeltacht area, I am proud and pleased that our culture, in its many facets, is alive and well in An Rinn.  However, it is not only the population of that small but vibrant area that keeps our language, music, singing and dancing alive and in active use.  Many young organisations around the county are dedicated to passing on to the upcoming population all that is best in our tradition.  We can point to various cabaret shows, particularly those run during the summer, in which people as young as ten and as mature as ten times that age show their skills nightly for the benefit of our population and visitors.  This is the product of many winter nights spent teaching, learning and enjoying Irish entertainment, just like our forefathers before them.A successful Tionól an Fhómhair, a weekend of Irish cultural activity, promoted by Waterford County Council and the local community of Coolnasmear and surrounding area was held just a couple of weeks ago and there is a full programme arranged for Seachtain na Gaeilge which will be held shortly.  However, there are far more activities than just the highly publicised ones.  I pay tribute to the many voluntary organisations and branches of Comhaltas that keep our culture alive on a daily basis, promote its use and popularity and ensure its future through its young membership.  If there is a dividend in the Bill for them — I hope there is — no more deserving section of the population could benefit from it.  Molaim iad go léir.Part of section 32 attempts to extend the protection of the public health interests of children through the curtailment of advertising aimed specifically at them and promoting food and drink that does not assist them towards a healthy lifestyle in terms of excess sugars, unhealthy fats or, in later stages, alcoholic drink.  We are consistently warned by the Department of Health and Children of the growing time bomb that is the overweight condition.  Many find the word "obesity" offensive, particularly when they recognise and acknowledge their problem, which they consider to be one of only being slightly overweight.We must protect our children.  While those who promote such foods and drink suggest advertising has minimal impact, they are merely trying to delude people and, worse still, take them for fools.  No company or business will pour millions of euro into advertising without an expectation of a return through increased sales.  That is what the €1 billion advertising industry is all about.  For their own sakes and that of an already overburdened health care system, we need to deliver a healthy next generation.  If this means protecting them from an unhealthy diet promoted by saturation advertising, that is what we must do.It is even more important in the case of alcohol, in respect of which there is an everlasting debate about what level of advertising should be allowed on radio and television.  During the passage of the Bill through the Seanad the point was well made that we were able to introduce a nil advertising regime for cigarettes.  Many believe we should do the same in the case of alcohol in the interests of the population's health.  Economically, this would also have benefits, ranging from fewer people occupying beds in our hospitals suffering from liver disease to a reduced number of road accidents  and of those who occupy our mental health institutions.  Add in the sanctuaries for battered wives and partners and there is a significant improvement we could make to our lifestyle, if we could only come to grips with the negative effects of alcohol.This is an excellent Bill with many positive and forward looking provisions.  With the few minor reservations I expressed, I confidently commend it to the House.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The most important issue raised in the Bill is that of addressing the future of the broadcasting sector, above all the protection of standards.  In our homes every Deputy has viewed on the multiplicity of channels available to us total rubbish, much of which promotes violence and abuse, particularly of women.  The standards of some of the programmes broadcast are disgraceful.  While, in general, the standard of television and radio services in this country is high, we can see the need to exercise vigilance, given events in other countries.  In particular, we need to ensure public broadcasting retains its central role.  This is important when we see the so-called dumbing down of much of the broadcast media, particularly television.While there are those who argue that so-called reality shows, sensationalised chat shows and so on are a reflection of popular culture, it is equally valid to state they actually help to form popular culture and in many instances not in a beneficial way to society.  Likewise, there are those who argue that recent changes in RTE radio in respect of specific areas of the arts are a reflection of public demand.  This argument has been used as justification for reducing the amount of time devoted to less popular forms of music and other items of minority interest.  In general, however, RTE radio is far superior to most of its competitors in that regard.The role of public broadcasting ought to be the same as that of any other public utility or service, namely, to cater for all sections of society, regardless of whether there is massive demand or whether it is commercially viable.  If the main criterion was commercial demand and applied to museums, public parks, libraries, playgrounds or football pitches, they would disappear.  It is vital, therefore, that the Bill protects the central role of public broadcasting and is all-inclusive.  It should protect those with minority interests.  It appears to provide mechanisms to ensure unsuitable individuals or companies will not be licensed.  Section 66 also appears to set stringent criteria for content, including in paragraph (d), as well as conditions regarding the Irish language and other aspects of Irish culture.  However, I would be happier if the Bill spelled out in concrete terms how this will be implemented by setting out, for example, the percentage of programming and airtime devoted to Irish language broadcasts and the level of Irish produced content.  It must be more specific.  I hope this suggestion will be taken on board.I note the concerns of the Association of Independent Radio Producers of Ireland which welcomes the provision in section 116 for RTE to commission independently produced radio programmes but expresses concern at the level of funding available to ensure the sector will be able to meet any such demand.  It is calling for 5% of the independent programme account, €2 million, to be set aside for the independent radio sector, which appears a reasonable request.  It is something that could be redressed by way of an amendment to section 116.It is necessary to clarify a number of issues regarding TG4.  Everyone agrees TG4 has been a welcome development, not only with regard to Irish language programming but also in its coverage of sport and other areas, including some very interesting historical documentaries.  I take great pleasure in watching footage of old all-Ireland games.  I watched two or three of them last Christmas.  I also take an interest in its controversial documentaries on the H-Block hunger strikes and the escape from the H-Block.  It is a fantastic facility for those of like mind and with other interests and I would like to see the funding available for it continue.  It is incumbent, therefore, on the Minister to ensure the channel is placed on a proper funding basis.  It is not enough to leave it contingent on what might be decided by a new authority as proposed in the Bill.  This would display the confidence of Members and those living on this island in the ability of TG4 to continue with the necessary confidence.  It must be placed on a proper and secure financial footing.  The Taoiseach has made clear and is obviously sincere in regard to his commitment to the Irish language.  The Government has an opportunity with this legislation to introduce the required amendments to ensure TG4 is properly catered for and I urge it to do so.Other provisions require amending.  For example, the Bill should specifically refer to an obligation on broadcasters to prioritise the coverage of domestic sport events.  Sports news should give first place to important events here rather than those in other countries, as is regularly the case.  I welcome coverage of and watch practically all sports but from our perspective it is important that national games and domestic sport events should receive priority in the coverage available.  Likewise, section 87 could be amended to ensure broadcasters fulfil their commitment with regard to programme content reflecting all aspects of Irish culture, including domestic sport events.  The role of sport and the obligation of publicly supported broadcasters to cover it could be made part of their responsibilities by amending section 82 to include a specific reference to sport as one of the areas they are obliged to cover, particularly domestic sport events.Section 96 provides for the establishment of an audience council.  The section should include a specific reference to the inclusion of persons representative of cultural organisations with an involvement in various aspects of Irish life.  It is important to get the balance right.One other issue of which many will be aware is that of the changes made to the manner in which RTE formats its broadcasts. This has led to people outside the State not being able to access radio broadcasts and some digital coverage.  I experienced this in the recent past when I was unable to pick up RTE radio services in parts of Belfast.  RTE has been a great resource for Irish people abroad during the years and it would be a pity if they were to be denied what they regard as an important part of their identity and heritage.  This is also a matter that could be addressed by amending section 114 to include a provision obliging the public broadcaster to ensure digital and radio broadcasts, particularly of major events here, are accessible outside the State.The Bill is long overdue, requires some amendment and should be more specific in certain areas I mentioned.  However, I welcome the fact that we are discussing it.  I hope amendments will be taken on board to enable all of us to support it to its conclusion.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	447	This legislation is timely and I commend the Minister for publishing it in May.  It has passed all Stages in the Seanad.  The Bill is detailed and comprehensive, dealing with all aspects of regulation and broadcasting content in Ireland.  Technology is improving at such a rate that it is important to update legislation to take account of changes in broadcasting.  I wish to comment on a number of proposals.The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will assume the existing role of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.  I am glad that the Minister has taken note of the report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and that it will have an input in deciding the membership of the authority.  The authority will consist of two independent statutory boards — the contracts award committee and the compliance committee.  The authority will have responsibility for the strategic direction of the organisation, as well as tasks such as preparing codes and rules for broadcasters and the running of the organisation.Other Members referred to the section that allows the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to introduce regulations on advertising, particularly with regard to food advertising aimed at children.  The inordinate increase in the problem of obesity, particularly in young teenagers, has not gone unnoticed and must be tackled.  I am glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Power, is present.  In his previous role as a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children he had a significant input in that area.  This matter is something we should deal with because we have seen its effects on young children.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Wallace, is acutely aware of the problem and supports the section dealing with the consumption of high-fat foods and their advertising at particularly sensitive times early in the afternoon when young children are watching.  The advertisements are professional and colourful, carry music and use cartoon characters.  They are certainly effective from an advertising and business point of view.  However, there are over 300,000 overweight and obese children in Ireland and the rate is rising by around 10,000 per annum.  We must deal with this matter because advertising has a significant impact on what young people eat.Regarding other parts of the Bill, yesterday the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources met the Screen Producers Association of Ireland which represents 180 members.  The delegates were fair in their comments in welcoming this legislation, of which they were supportive.  However, there are issues that they asked be addressed.  I ask the Minister to take into account their views on Committee Stage.  In particular, they mentioned that the Bill provided for a figure of €40 million per annum for RTE to spend on independent productions.  While that is welcome, taking into account that last year RTE spent €77 million on such productions, the producers are of the view that rather than have a fixed sum assigned, a percentage of RTE's revenue should be used instead.  They proposed a figure of 35% of the station's annual revenue.  As RTE is the dominant player in broadcasting and, therefore, the biggest customer of independent film producers, the screen producers have a case.Irish people like to hear stories told by Irish people.  We have a creative vision in telling stories.  It is important, therefore, that we support those creative people who work in the independent television production sector.  The change would be for the good of licence fee payers, would benefit RTE and have a positive impact on jobs in the economy.  As we face a difficult time, it is important that we recognise and acknowledge the role the people concerned play.  Their proposal would be good value for money.  The independent sector produces 50% of top-rated prime time entertainment programmes on a highly cost efficient basis for RTE.  If RTE had to make these programmes, they would be considerably more costly.  A percentage rather than a fixed annual spend would be good for RTE, as it would recognise that the station's commercial revenues are dependent on market conditions and that as these fall, advertising falls.  Therefore, the percentage the station would have to spend on the indpendent sector would also fall, an aspect the independent producers acknowledged.  Part of RTE's stated vision is to nurture and reflect cultural and regional diversity and provide distinctive programming with an emphasis on home production.  The proposal would offer a way of delivering positively on this.  The current spend is €77 million, which demonstrates the licence payers' appetite for independently produced programmes.The Screen Producers Association was also concerned about rights to programmes.  The current position is that a producer of a programme buys the rights from performers, writers, musicians and packages them for sale to the broadcaster, in this case RTE.  Under current broadcasting contracts, however, RTE buys all rights in perpetuity for 100% funded programmes.  This causes problems for producers who find that RTE takes programmes, broadcasts them and pays for them.  After that, however, there is no aftersales service by RTE.  The independent producers would like to see a situation where, after a certain time, perhaps two or three years, they would be allowed to take back the rights and sell them on to other international broadcasters or as rights for DVDs.  They gave the example of "Riverdance".  A producer retained rights and developed a stage show which generated millions for RTE and the producer.  They would like to see this expanded upon in order that a producer who makes a programme under contract for RTE can have the rights returned if after a number of years the station does not use the programme.  The producer might then exploit more revenue from the programme after that time lapse, perhaps on the basis of a 50-50 share of profits.The third issue I wish to mention concerns children's programming.  There are over 28 children's channels available, broadcasting from the United Kingdom into Ireland on terrestrial, cable and satellite signals through different providers.  We must have a new strategic plan for such programming in Ireland.  From pre-school to the formative teenage years our children should be provided with Irish programming relevant to them that will entertain, educate, stimulate and provide a cultural awareness for them.  Irish-produced children's programming currently represents only 9% of what is broadcast on Irish television channels.  Almost 80% of children's programming on RTE comprises international imports, many of which are repeats.  This is an area in which there is scope to improve.  We can reinvest with Irish film producers who are keen to make such programming and who have the capacity, wherewithal and talent to do so.  We should exploit the talent available.  Much new young energetic talent is available for such programming.  I would like to see this happen.The Broadcasting Bill proposes a new approach to the appointment of boards of semi-State companies.  In the case of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, there will be nine board members, five appointed by the Government after nomination by the Minister, and four by the Government after nomination by the Minister on the advice of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I welcome this proposal and the committee of which I am a member will actively participate in making recommendations for this panel to be considered, first, by the Minister and then by the Government.  In the case of RTE and TG4, there will be 12 board members, six appointed by the Government after nomination by the Minister and four after nomination by the Minister, again on the recommendation of the Oireachtas joint committee.  That is a positive step because it gives Members of the House from both sides an opportunity to have an input into the appointment of board members.The joint committee recently visited TG4 and was very impressed by the work it does.  One of the concerns of personnel there was the lack of control in respect of television channels that beam into this country and how greater control might be exercised.  They have a particular problem in this regard.Referring to the previous contribution by Deputy Ferris, I also commend TG4 on its sports programming.  It has been first class in picking up the ball and running with it in terms of Gaelic games, in particular the football club championships.  I am pleased that the GAA in its wisdom decided to spread coverage of football and hurling beyond the sole remit of RTE.  This affords a smaller television station such as TG4 an opportunity to reach out to a wider audience.  The public has accepted and embraced the channel because of what it is doing.  It is a small channel but has taken on this new challenge and with limited resources competed with the best.As for soccer, a number of League of Ireland matches are televised by RTE and some other channels.  However, it is a challenge for that league to compete with what is coming in from across the water.  Perhaps it could take a leaf from what is happening in the rugby sector in which limited professionalism obtains.  However, Irish rugby teams compete on the European and Magners League stages where it has specialised in special matches and, therefore, attract an audience.  The FAI needs support and I encourage it to examine this aspect of their coverage, thereby supporting the game in Ireland, because it is important to have a young population active in sport.  As this, again, ties in with the aforementioned obesity problem, it is important to encourage young people to participate actively in sport.I wish the Bill every success in its passage through the House and look forward to a lively Committee Stage debate at the Select Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  Our democracy is built on a number of core values, namely, free elections, free speech and freedom of assembly, of which free speech is among the most precious.  In recent decades Ireland has given greater scope to freedom of expression.  Long gone are the days when classic films and works of literature were censored.  This went on for too long and constitutes a black mark against the early days of the State.  We now are much more liberal about what is permissible to be sold and broadcast.It seems, however, that some things are still forbidden.  For example, a recent radio advertisement for the Catholic bookseller Veritas was banned by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, BCC, because it associated the phrase "spiritual gifts" with Holy Communion and confirmation.  As the advertisement made clear, the spiritual gifts in question were items such as rosary beads and prayer cards.  Last Christmas another advertisement by Veritas was not carried on RTE because it included the word "crib".  While it beggars belief that advertisements for cribs and First Holy Communion gifts are deemed to be in breach of the law, that is the case.  Perhaps this is a good example of what the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, called "aggressive secularism".It appears that our new found tolerance does not always extend to religion.  In fact, religion, even in its everyday form, is regarded as something suspect to be kept in a box.  How else is one to regard legislation that bans advertisements for cribs from the airwaves?  To bring home the absurdity of this latest advertisement ban, I will read it out in full.  It reads:Come to Veritas for great Confirmation and First Holy Communion gift ideas. Choose from our diverse range of religious and inspirational gifts that include children's literature, prayer books, rosary beads, religious medals and candles.  So if you want to give your loved one a spiritual gift which relates to what Holy Communion and Confirmation are really about, [come to] Veritas.Could anything be more harmless?  In spite of this, the advertisement was held by the BCC to violate section 9 of the general advertising code, as developed in accordance with the Broadcasting Act 2001.  The relevant section states advertisements "directed towards a religious end" are "not acceptable".  The legislation also bans advertisements which appear to promote the merits or otherwise of any particular religion.  To be fair, I also should point out that advertisements directed towards a political end also are banned.  However, this never has stopped secular newspapers from advertising their often highly political content.  There appears to be a double standard in the application of the relevant legislation.The American constitution creates an absolute right to free speech.  Politicians and religious groups are free to broadcast their views on air as long as they can pay to so do.  No one is calling for such a free for all regime in Ireland and no one wants to see the negative advertising that occurs in the United States filling our airwaves.  However, it must be possible to find a happy medium.  How can the use of the word "crib" or the phrase "spiritual gifts" in connection with First Holy Communion seriously be considered harmful to society?  Such advertisements should not be banned out of an unreasonable fear of opening the door to the sort of extreme religion of which Members are rightly wary.Although one can advertise tarot readings on the airwaves, one can only place religious advertisements on the airwaves in the most limited possible circumstances, even though religion, despite some of the legitimate criticisms which can be made against it, does much good in this country.  The new Broadcasting Bill presents Members with an excellent opportunity to amend the section dealing with religious advertising and introduce a law that is more in keeping with common sense.  I call on the Minister to seize this opportunity.

Undoubtedly, while the media have transformed our lives, things have changed dramatically in that sector during the past 40 years.  I recently read an account of President John F. Kennedy's visit to Ireland in 1963 highlighting what a major undertaking it was for RTE to broadcast the visit live.  In all, it broadcasted approximately 14 hours of live coverage of his visit, which constituted a major task for the station at the time.  Great technological advances in television broadcasting certainly have been made.  While President Kennedy's visit took place a long time ago, all Members can recall the events of 11 September 2001 when people witnessed the second aeroplane crashing into the tower live on their television screens.  The dramatic changes in broadcasting during that period have been such that the attack was beamed into every home in the United States and Ireland.This legislation is long overdue and although it contains many good provisions that I welcome, some areas will require fine tuning.  "Digital" is the new buzzword and Members have been informed that digital broadcasting will come into force in December 2012 when analogue transmissions will cease and the new era of digital broadcasting in the form of digital terrestrial television, DTT, will commence.  While the European Commission is anxious to push this date forward, that is unlikely at this stage.There is very little information on how the transfer will come about or its costs.  The Minister should comment on this issue in his response to Members at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate.  Consumers will be obliged to acquire a new set-top box to receive the channels and I wish to ascertain what it will cost.  While Members have been told that RTE will provide four free-to-air channels, I seek information on the cost involved, particularly on whether elderly people living in isolated rural areas will be obliged to pay a charge.  Radio and television services constitute a lifeline for those living alone and for many, serve as the candle in the window.  Members must find out whether the service will continue to be free to air?  I refer to the example of television licences.  Everyone remembers when a television licence cost £5 per annum.  The annual cost subsequently increased to £50 and then to the present amount, which I understand to be €150.  Clearly, the licence fee has increased greatly as the years have passed.  Moreover, Sky Television which has been installed in many households in recent years costs a phenomenal amount.  Many householders who subscribe to the film and sports channels pay more than €100 per month to receive such broadcasts.Do I have much more time before the debate must adjourn?

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I welcome the motion from the Labour Party.  The Fine Gael amendment reads:to delete all words after "employment" in the second last paragraph and substitute the following paragraphs:"—access to a local employment service for every unemployed person;maintaining investment in NDP projects that will improve our competitiveness such as metro and broadband;a total overhaul of FÁS to ensure that training and upskilling programmes are effective in terms of outcome and efficient in the use of tax-payers money;embarking on a radical programme to reduce the administrative cost of regulation by 25% using the International Standards Cost Model."There is no question that the current position regarding unemployment is very worrying as there are now over 240,000 people on the live register.  It will clearly break 250,000 by next month and by January it will be over 270,000, meaning the numbers signing on will be higher than when former Deputies John Bruton and Dick Spring left power 11 or 12 years ago.At 6.1% — the standardised unemployment rate, which is the internationally comparable figure — our unemployment is now higher than in America, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark, Singapore, the Czech Republic, Japan, Israel, Luxembourg and Norway.  I could go on.  It is pretty clear that within the next few months we will overtake Italy, and within the next year we will probably overtake France and Germany as well.  Once again we are becoming a country of relatively high unemployment.I welcome the Labour motion, which I agree with thoroughly.  I concur that a major school building programme could help employment and I agree with the proposal on a national insulation scheme.  I have always been between two minds with the county enterprise boards but Deputy English has convinced me on that point, as well as the lead-in time for the back to education allowance.  Deputy Enright will comment on that, as well as the community employment schemes.Some 25,000 people are now involved in such schemes and to be honest, they statistically have little value as an active labour market measure.  They have very strong and important value in terms of social employment.  Members of my extended family who suffer from mental illness have done very well on community employment schemes and there may well be a case over the coming months and years to begin increasing the number of such schemes again, particularly as one considers welfare payments are largely being replaced with payments for doing something.  There is a strong case for this, particularly if the schemes are freed from the dead hand of FÁS, which adds additional costs and little benefit.  I expect local authorities would do a much better job.There is probably only one small aspect of the Labour Party motion I do not agree with, the proposal to improve access to the jobs initiative.  This initiative is really being abandoned by Government and rightly so.  The entry is closed and the scheme is being scaled down, which is the right measure.  It was so ineffective in getting long-term unemployed people back to work that a decision was made to cancel it, which was correct.  If we are to act on the long-term unemployed, we must do something new.  To bring back a scheme that cost a fortune and did not work would not be something I would not agree with.Our amendment would add some ideas, as dealing with unemployment will not just be about State supports and spending.  We will also have to create the environment of job creation.  When this Government took power 11 or 12 years ago, Ireland was a great place to employ people.  Our costs were low and there was an available work force with the skills to match but that is all being eroded.  The basis for the Celtic tiger economy has been worn away over the last ten years.  We have provided one or two things to help.The first is ongoing investment in the national development plan projects, especially those that make sense such as school building, the metro and broadband in particular.  That is another area where we have fallen behind.  When the rainbow Government left power we were the fourth most competitive economy in the world.  Today, according to the World Economic Forum, we lie in 22nd place despite the efforts of the National Competitiveness Council and all the talk we heard from the Ministers, Deputy Micheál Martin and Mary Coughlan, over the years.  They have achieved nothing with respect to improving competitiveness in the past six years, an indictment of the way our economy has been run.We have identified the issue of regulation and the use of the standard cost model in particular.  This will first assess the cost of regulation to business and then bring it down.Unemployment is without doubt a growing and real problem.  I am disappointed with the blasé response we have received from Ministers to date and welcome the motion from the Labour Party.  I particularly welcome that it is full of ideas and suggestions as to what we can do to help people who are losing their jobs, as they will suffer the most in the coming months.  All of us with jobs will pay a little bit more, those on welfare will get a little more but the people who will really suffer are those who are losing their jobs.  They will lose perhaps 75% of their income almost overnight.  That is where we should focus our concern.This debate really shows a difference between Labour, which has suggested so many good ideas; Fine Gael, which has made some suggestions also; and a Government which has not taken a single initiative in the last year to deal with the crisis.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I welcome the Labour Party motion.  As with many of last night's speakers, my constituency of Laois-Offaly has experienced severe job losses in the past year.  I will deal briefly with the constituency figures.  In Offaly, the number has risen by over 1,500 and in Laois the number has risen by just under 2,000 in the last year.  Breaking these figures into their respective areas, they are particularly stark.  The lowest loss is in the Rathdowney area, with 211, Birr has 311 and Edenderry has 390.  Getting to the bigger towns the loss is substantial.  For example, the figure for Portarlington is 763, Tullamore is 831 and Portlaoise is 980.The most worrying part of this is that in both Laois and Offaly, 27% of those who lost their jobs in the past year are under 25.  That figure speaks for itself.  We have greater reason to worry in that we have had two significant announcements of job cuts this year in Boston Scientific and Rationel Vinduer.  This will be well over 300 jobs that have not joined those figures yet, as those companies are to close in the coming months.  That is the scale of the problem in my area, although others have spoken of other areas.Having read the speech by the Minister and Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan, last night, I am unconvinced there is a recognition of the scale of the problem we face.  The constant harping back to the line that this is part of something happening in the rest of the world is incorrect and shows the Government is failing to get to grips with the problem.  The fall in growth in this country far outstrips the fall in the rest of the euro area and our rise in unemployment runs contrary to the overall euro area experience.We hear the Minister say we have an employment market well placed to meet and tackle the current economic challenges but the figures do not bear that out.  That is my concern.I will deal specifically with the adequacy of the State response.  I questioned the Minister and Tánaiste, as well as FÁS, about the loss of apprenticeships this year.  I raised the matter at the beginning of the summer and again through parliamentary questions and in committee, when Deputy Varadkar was present.  The steps being taken give no hope for the thousands of apprentices who have lost their apprenticeships in the past few months.To be told last week that FÁS has opened discussions with relevant bodies and authorities does not inspire confidence that this idea is getting the urgency it deserves.  These are young people left with no qualification and no real opportunity of work without qualification.  They have no real opportunity to complete their apprenticeship in order to qualify in the current climate.  This calls for a little bit of imagination.  We should look to our institutes of technology and all our third level institutions so we can see what opportunity exists for these apprentices to qualify through the system.  It demands thinking outside the box that the Government is so fond of staying in.  We must act to give these young people any chance.I am glad the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, is here.  The back to education allowance must be addressed by the Government, as it has again ignored the reality.  Every Deputy in this House has had a queue of people coming to him or her who are caught because they have not been unemployed for a year.  Everybody believes there must be rules for schemes but there is a lack of flexibility in this scheme, particularly in the current climate.  These people are still being paid jobseeker's allowance but it would be far more cost-effective to pay them to go to third level and get a qualification.This should be considered for people on the minimum wage as well.  A person on jobseeker's allowance may be getting rent supplement, a medical card and so on, and such people come out with a euro per week more than somebody on the minimum wage.  The operation of the back to education allowance is an example of bureaucracy gone mad.  While there will be cuts in next week's budget, I hope common sense will prevail and schemes will be made much more cost effective.While it is easy in the current climate to focus on large multinational employers, we must also emphasise the role of small and medium size employers, for example, a local clothes or shoe shop which employs three or four people.  This sector is being hit hard in current economic conditions and its position is likely to worsen after Christmas.Following next week's budget, local authorities will commence their estimates process.  I am concerned that hikes in rates will result in the closure of companies which would otherwise manage, perhaps only barely, to stay in business.  This issue must be addressed next week.  It will be pointless to blame county councillors if small and medium size businesses are effectively forced to close in a few months because local councils decide to increase rates as a result of an inadequate allocation by central Government.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I share the concern expressed by Deputies about the social and economic impact of rising unemployment.  We are all conscious that behind the latest live register figures lie real people with families who have mortgages and concerns about the future.  I assure the House that the Government is determined to do all it can to help people get back to work as quickly as possible.The longer people spend on social welfare, the more dependent they become.  The main welfare to work measure is the national employment action plan, NEAP, under which people who are approaching three months on the live register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to job placement or an offer of training.  Slightly more than 30,000 people were referred to FÁS under the NEAP in the first six months of 2008.  Of these, 13,350 or 44% have left the live register.  I have also discussed with FÁS ways in which we can increase uptake of this process.A team of facilitators is in place in the Department to provide additional, more intensive assistance for those who need it, including those who have been identified by FÁS as needing further support.  As part of the priority now placed on activation, the Department's facilitators are working closely with FÁS and other agencies at national and local level to target their assistance at such groups.  A particular priority is being placed on younger people, significant numbers of whom are losing their jobs, those signing on for the first time and those who have completed the employment action plan process but remain on the live register.  As I indicated, it is important that people do not become dependent on social welfare for extended periods.The facilitator programme is designed to be a targeted approach, involving active case management and the development of an individualised personal progression plan.  The facilitator and individual will work together to identify the most appropriate method of progressing to training or employment.  The Department appointed additional facilitators in September to support the process.We are also committed to eliminating poverty traps and removing barriers to work.  Significant progress has been made in this regard in recent years through improvements such as changes in means testing arrangements for certain payments and the tapered withdrawal of benefits. The back to work allowance provides a monetary incentive for people who have been dependent on social welfare payments for long periods to make return to work financially attractive and viable.Deputy Enright referred to a number of additional benefits available to people who are unemployed.  While the benefits in question support those who are unemployed, they can also deter people from returning to work.

When discrepancies arise, my Department will try to rectify them.The back to education allowance scheme is designed to help those who have not worked for some time to improve their employability and job readiness by acquiring educational qualifications.  The scheme is a recognition of the special difficulties such persons can face when attempting to gain a foothold in the labour market.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme and is considered necessary to ensure limited resources are directed at those most in need.  It is important to avoid circumstances in which those who have recently completed the leaving certificate examination spend a few months in receipt of social welfare payments with a view to qualifying for the back to education allowance.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces the person's existing social welfare income and an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.  To qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and persons in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they have not been in formal education for at least two years.In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for six months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  However, since 2007  people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the back to education allowance scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  This measure has increased the number of people participating in the scheme.In addition, the qualifying period for access to the third level option has been reduced to nine months for persons who are participating in the national employment action plan process and where a FÁS employment services officer recommends pursuance of such a course.  I intend to keep the current scheme under review.  In September, we organised a useful seminar through Mr. Brian Mooney of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors which brought together facilitators from around the country to inform them of the various educational opportunities available in order that they could advise their clients of same.  Those who attended the seminar found it useful.The number of participants on the back to education allowance scheme has increased in recent years, supported by a growth in expenditure on the scheme from €38 million in 2003 to a provision of €70 million this year.Several speakers referred to the delays in processing claims being experienced in some social welfare offices.  This problem, which has arisen as a result of the number of people signing on, can be difficult for individuals.  However, we are taking measures to ensure the process is accelerated.  These include additional posts assigned to local offices from other parts of the Department, the use of temporary staff to fill vacancies, increased overtime and prioritisation of work.  These measures are being reviewed on a continuous basis as I am anxious to ensure the service is efficient.The Government is determined to ensure those who become unemployed receive the financial support they need in a timely manner and, more important, are able to secure help to return to work through the back to education allowance or by preparing them for the future.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	472	Following on from last evening's address to the House by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, I welcome this opportunity to reaffirm the excellent track record of county enterprise boards in fostering local entrepreneurial potential.  Since their establishment in 1993, the enterprise boards have gone from strength to strength.  They have never stagnated but have grown with their clientele and successfully adapted to the needs of their client base.On the provision of financial assistance, there has been a gradual shift in emphasis from direct financial assistance towards increasing resort to repayable forms of assistance.  The Department is satisfied that this form of finance meets the needs of the client companies of the county enterprise boards and allows for significantly more companies to benefit from the available funds.  This must be a priority consideration in the current circumstances.The county enterprise boards have deepened their role in promoting a culture of entrepreneurship in their respective localities.  The provision of management capability training, direct mentoring and networked opportunities carries its own value and weight and has been a significant financial investment by the State in the micro-enterprise sector for the past 15 years.I will comment briefly on the provision of financial assistance, an issue raised yesterday evening by Opposition Deputies.  The total budget available for the county enterprise board network in 2008 is more than €34 million, of which €20 million is available for capital expenditure alone.  The allocation of individual budgets to the 35 county and enterprise boards is carried out by the county enterprise boards central co-ordination unit, known as the CCU.  This unit was established in Enterprise Ireland to carry out a number of functions in relation to the boards which had previously been undertaken by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Such functions include the allocation of budgets to individual boards for the year and the effective management of available resources to the county enterprise board network to maximise sustainable development in the micro-enterprise sector.In determining the 2008 allocations for individual boards, the CCU adopted a systemic approach to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  It is a matter for individual boards to determine how they will use allocated funds as well as the own income funds available to them from repayable grants in the most effective manner possible.  Some boards may choose to commit all their available funding as projects present themselves, even if this means their funding is exhausted relatively early in the year, while others may choose to reserve some funding until later in the year in order that they are in a position to support other high quality projects that emerge at that time.  This would explain why some boards may have utilised their funding earlier in the year than other boards.  As part of the normal yearly budgetary cycle, some boards will request additional funding to support a variety of expenditures beyond their original allocations.  Such requests are made by boards in the knowledge that these requests can only be considered should additional funding become available.As part of the CCU's ongoing management of available funding for 2008, the unit has already conducted a review of CEB spending in August.  This exercise has in the past been carried out in September-October and it has generally been the case that a number of boards are not in a position to spend all their annual allocations.  Accordingly, where surplus funding became available, it was reallocated to any boards in a position to spend additional funds, subject to thorough assessment of the rationale and justification for the level of funding being requested.Following an exercise carried out in August, no county enterprise board was at that time in a position to surrender money, while 13 of the 35 CEBs located around the country indicated to the CCU that they could utilise additional capital funding.  A further such trawl of the boards will take place shortly after which some boards may be able to surrender money in respect of grant allocations.  Any such surrenders would be available to redistribute to other boards.On foot of the August exercise, my Department has made available additional capital finance of €500,000 for use by boards for direct grant aid to enterprises.  This was originally allocated to the CEBs to part fund another specific initiative for which the full allocation is not now required.  In addition to the annual budget allocation to each board, including the €500,000 allocation I mentioned, boards also have access to significant moneys from repaid grants which they can recycle to provide further grants to eligible clients.It should be stressed that it is a basic expectation of boards that they will manage the delivery of their support programmes on the basis of their allocated amount over the year as a whole.  As with all State-funded assistance, boards are expected to prioritise and manage available funding in a targeted and effective manner.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I welcome this opportunity to briefly contribute to this serious and important debate.  In his absence, I compliment Deputy Penrose, my good friend and colleague, on his work in this regard.I am delighted the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is present in the Chamber.  Those of us who strongly believe in social inclusion and that the vulnerable and the disadvantaged should be looked after are confident she will show sufficient care to ensure they are well looked after next week.  The Minister will have a demanding week next week and I wish her well and have great confidence in what she will do and will continue to do.  Fianna Fáil has had a proud record of achievement in the provision of social welfare benefits, on which I am sure even Deputy Penrose will agree, over the decades, long before many of us Members were elected.  We continue to strive for such provision.If one was to listen to the RTE News or Sky News today, one might be afraid to get out of bed because of the changes in the world and the difficulties we face.  Many Members spoke about the difficulties in the 1980s and I remember the 1980s; I can vaguely remember the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s but I certainly remember the 1980s.  I bring to politics my life experiences.  I was made redundant three times in my life and I know what it is like to go home to one's family and tell them that one has been made redundant and has to start all over again.  I am glad I have that experience and I understand the concerns of the people who come to see me.I remember being a founder member, with many other colleagues, of the Get Tallaght Working Group in 1984.  That was a time when Tallaght, the third largest population centre in the country, needed jobs, impetus, investment and for things to happen, and thank God that has happened.  Like other major centres, considerable progress in job creation has been made in recent times, but now we face challenges.I was glad to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, talk about the contribution enterprise boards can make.  We all know that the best way out of poverty is to make sure people have jobs.  I quoted the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, many times in this respect, namely, when the big boats are rising, we must remember the little boats, but if the big boats are struggling, we absolutely must remember the little boats.  Every Deputy will talk about the job creation needs of their constituencies, with which I have no problem.  I live in Tallaght in Dublin South-West, which  is a major population centre.  We have needs in that regard and I am never afraid to point them out.The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, was correct in that in areas where big jobs cannot be created, enterprise boards and organisations such as Partas in Tallaght have a clear role to play, through the enterprise centres, to create employment.  The Minister of State made a very positive statement, but I advise him that the county enterprise boards always face challenges.  There are a few changes that could be made in that respect.  In the context of the remit of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, I hope the services her Department and that of the Tánaiste provide will continue to be client friendly.I record that the Minister spoke about the fine contribution the enterprise boards make in south Dublin, but people within the organisation advise me that the enterprise boards throughout the country — this is certainly true in Tallaght — should be given the ability to assist companies that are in trouble.  They should also be allowed to help those companies in relation to their size because that issue is still a difficulty and there are still restrictions in that respect.I am also advised by people who go to enterprise boards seeking to create jobs that it would be helpful if county enterprise boards were allowed to give guarantees to companies to help secure bank loans.  They are not able to do that.  I am advised, as confirmed by information down-loaded from the Internet by a colleague today, that this is done through the Small Business Association in the United States.  That is an issue that should be addressed.These are difficult times and people of my generation have lived through difficult times before.  We have to keep going, keep investing and make sure that the vulnerable are looked after.  I look forward to continuing to support that.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I share with Deputies on all sides of the House the concern about the extraordinary increase in the number of people signing on the live register.  We are living in unprecedented and extraordinary economic times.  There was a time when the economy changed by the week, but now it is not changing by the week nor by the day but by the hour.  The Government must recognise that and deal with the issues as they arise.  The increase in the number of those signing on the live register is indicative of what is happening not only in Ireland but in the international economy.  It may be fire-fighting to an extent, but the Government has had to deal with the economy, which has been in a downturn for some time, and with issues as they arise such as the extraordinary scenes we witnessed last week when the banking sector was on the brink of collapse and would have done so were it not for the quick and effective action of the Government in dealing with the matter on Tuesday night.  Its action is to be commended and Ministers for Finance in other countries, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, are taking a leaf out of the Government's book.It is important to record, lest we forget, that more than 640,000 jobs were created in the past 11 years and more than 2 million people are working in this country.  I am glad the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is present in the Chamber.  She referred to the back to work and back to education allowances.  We should encourage young people, in particular, who now find themselves unemployed, having lost a job, and who wish to seek further education to take up that allowance.  One of the conditions of the back to education allowance is that the person must be unemployed and signing on for unemployment assistance for the 12 months immediately prior to claiming the allowance, but some individuals may not have been entitled to unemployment for one reason or other, perhaps based on their parents' income.  I ask that changes be introduced to allow those individuals to avail of this scheme because it is worthwhile.  Education was the cornerstone of our economic recovery in the past 20 years and anything the Minister can do, other than pay out social welfare, to encourage people back into the education system is to be welcomed.Another issue to which I wish to refer is that of energy efficiency and the impact that the increasingly high cost of fuel is having on social welfare recipients, particularly those who are senior citizens.  In recent years, Government policy has focused on increasing primary social welfare rates in order to ensure that those on benefit payments can meet their heating and basic living costs throughout the year.  There has been a dramatic rise in the cost of fuel and heating oil during the past months.  In recent days, the price of oil has decreased but it is still significantly higher than it was 12 months ago.The Department of Social and Family Affairs also pays dedicated allowances that are specifically designed to supplement other payments.  These include the electricity or gas allowance, paid as part of the household benefits package, and the fuel allowance scheme and are aimed at mitigating the impact of high energy costs.  I accept that times are difficult but I encourage the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, in the context of next week's budget, to fight her corner and ensure that those on the margins of society are well catered for.  People are uncertain with regard to what they are facing into this winter and they deserve the protection and guardianship of the Government and the Minister in particular.The Government will have a difficult job in addressing the problems we face.  It is acting effectively, efficiently and in a timely manner on the domestic scene.  Unfortunately, however, Ireland's is a small, open economy and it is, to a large extent, dependent on what happens overseas.  Much of what occurs is outside our control.  While we have systems and regulations in place in respect of domestic matters, we have no control over what is happening in the United States, which seems to be the source of all the problems that have been experienced to date.  I hope someone will, following the presidential election next month, take control of the US and that there will be light at the end of the tunnel, hopefully by spring of next year.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I welcome this opportunity to set out the important part played by the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and the institutes of technology in the delivery of skills and training to Ireland's workforce.  The VTOS programme is funded by the Government and delivered locally by VECs.  It plays an important role, recognises that some people need a second chance at education and training and provides courses of up to two years' duration for unemployed people.The scheme has proved to be extremely successful.  VTOS progression statistics for 2007 show that where a course was of two years' duration, approximately 72% of participants who completed the programme in that year had progressed to either employment or further education and training.  Just over 28% returned to either the live register or their original status.  People aged 21 or over and in receipt of jobseekers benefit or assistance, the one-parent family payment, disability allowance, disability benefit, invalidity pension etc., for at least six months are eligible for VTOS.  Those signing for credits who satisfy these conditions and the dependant spouses of eligible persons may also avail of the programme.Persons on unemployment assistance or benefit receive a payment from the VEC in lieu of their welfare payment, equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit.  It is important to set out details of the scheme because it often goes unnoticed by those in most need.  Many Members who meet people at their constituency offices are often somewhat surprised that they are not aware of the programme.  In the remaining cases, persons attending full-time retain their welfare payment.  That is an important aspect and I hope it will continue to be the case.  In order to attract long-term unemployed people, a bonus of €31.80 per week is payable to participants who have been in receipt of an eligible social welfare payment for at least one year immediately prior to starting VTOS.The scheme has proved to be a great success in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment.  Progression will be more difficult for many of these individuals in light of the changed economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Those who are highly skilled and who may lose their jobs will obviously take up positions that might otherwise have been used for progression purposes.  We will be obliged to work harder in order to ensure that further positions become available.The investment in ancillary supports is reflected in the increased non-pay expenditure, up from €34 million in 2002 to €45 million in 2007.  Overall expenditure on VTOS, including the pay of teaching staff, participant allowances and other non-pay costs was just under €70 million last year.  That is a considerable investment and it has gone unnoticed as the debate on the motion has progressed.Institutes of technology programmes have traditionally been developed with strong industry input and the institutes continue to engage with their graduates' employers to ensure that the relevance of their programmes is maintained.  This is critical because institutes offer higher education programmes of shorter duration than would be typical of those offered in universities and the curricula have a practical orientation designed to be responsive to the needs of local industries and smaller business interests.The institutes of technology are developing a project which aims to bring about the creation of a flexible learning network.  The proposal, which addresses lifelong learning and upskilling needs, involves partnerships between all 13 institutes and the DIT.  Reference is often made to the notion of joined-up thinking, whether it be on the part of the Government or among particular groups or elements of industry that operate in broadly similar areas.  It is extremely important that such thinking be to the fore in the partnership to which I refer.  In keeping with current Government and market needs, it is essential that there be a commitment to mainstreaming supported flexible learning within and among the institutes as an innovative and complementary mode of delivery.  This flexible learning system aims to expand the number of people in the workforce engaged in education and development through increased access to and participation in higher education using flexible learning methods.  It is intended to develop, pilot and expand programmes and modules that will assist in supporting lifelong learning, increase opportunities to engage in lifelong learning for members of the workforce and expand the overall participation rates in such learning.Annual returns to the HEA suggest that the overall number of vacant places in universities and colleges is decreasing and that, in a number of cases, CAO points requirements have also dropped.  An increasing number of students are now opting to enrol on higher level programmes, such those at level 8 of the national qualifications framework.When one considers the overall picture, it is clear the Government has a strong involvement in the developments taking place in this area.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Penrose, for tabling the original motion.It has been a worrying and sad feature of constituency clinics during the past six months that one has been visited by sensible men and women who have either lost their jobs or are about to lose them.  I never fail to be struck by the poignancy of what they have to say, particularly due to the fact that for some years one was not approached by people in this position because everyone had a job.  If one called to a house in the past, four or five of the people living there would be in employment.  That was heartening and exciting because I have always been of the view that if one has a job, one has the key to so much else in life.  A job gives one confidence, which is a major factor in one's life, and a belief in oneself.Apart from losing their jobs, many people's morale has plummeted.  One will hear individuals asking where, in light of their current age, they might obtain employment.  One searches and does one's best to try to find them a suitable position.  If an ordinary but well-paid job with the local authority is advertised, one's heart goes out to the many people who compete and would be suitable for it.  This is where the work of FÁS must come into play.  I have great time for FÁS, although I know there are reviews and investigations going on currently.  Despite this, I have found FÁS to be a strong organisation.  Its main emphasis is on the customers, the people it wants to see in further training, community employment or moving into a job.  This has always been the work of FÁS.  Before we throw out the baby with the bath water, I hope emphasis will be placed on the fine work FÁS has done and continues to do.  This does not take into account the way FÁS has changed our environment through the fine landscape work in which it has been involved throughout the country.Our communities have been equally fortunate with the work of the county enterprise boards.  We are very lucky in this regard in County Westmeath and I am sure Deputy Penrose would bear that out.  Westmeath has an excellent enterprise board with two wonderful women in the positions of chairperson and CEO.  Both of them are strong people with the good of the county at heart and they work productively on behalf of small businesses.In recent years people commented on the number of cranes to be seen on our skyline and saw them as a sign of work and progress, which they were.  However, I would prefer to see productive small businesses employing between five and 12 people.  These small businesses should be encouraged to stay in business.  It takes very little to enable a small company stay in business, but it also takes very little to tip it the other way so that it fades away.  Whatever methods possible, administrative or financial, must be used to encourage these small businesses to remain in business so they can employ one or two extra people.  This would be far better than depending on cranes to boost employment.  Cranes disappear quickly.  When the job is done the operators pack their traps and leave.  They may do good work, but they leave once it is done.I hope county enterprise boards will be invigorated and will continue to get Government funding to enable them to continue their work.  Whatever the result of the investigations into FÁS, I hope FÁS will remain what it has been, the backbone for training and job opportunities for many people.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I am sorry the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has left the Chamber because I wanted to raise an issue with regard to the measures she proposes to reduce the processing time for dealing with the applications for assistance from those who have been unfortunate enough to lose their jobs and who are currently on waiting lists.  Newbridge, which is the area office for Athy and Baltinglass, currently has a waiting list of 2,000 with a delay of eight weeks for processing.  While I welcome the Minister's statement, I hope she will take a look at the situation in that area.  It is unacceptable that with the current state of our economy and the problems people have with mortgage payments etc. that people have to wait for that period of time.  Some people have lost their jobs and some, such as the Tegral workers in Athy, are on short time, but they all need to have their applications for assistance processed.  I hope the Minister applies what she said in her statement to the Newbridge office to ensure the waiting time is reduced.Yesterday we acknowledged the wonderful political contribution of Séamus Brennan to this House and to politics in general.  I remember one occasion he was in the House dealing with one of the major cutbacks introduced by a former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Coughlan, when she extended the time period to qualify for the back to education allowance to 15 months.  After debate on the issue the late Mr. Brennan reduced the period to 12 months.  It is now time to review the situation again and ensure we return to the right position.  This allowance is acknowledged as a major contribution for those who want to get back to education and who have the will to do so, despite having to wait nine months to get an allowance.  We should look now and in our debate on the coming budget at the possibility of reducing the waiting period to nine months.I believe that if we are to make progress in these difficult times, we must depend on the small and the great rather than expect major industrial development from overseas.  In that regard, it is a major disappointment that our local authorities are being deprived of grants to assist in works to help senior citizens, for example, bathrooms.  When we consider this in respect of the recession in the building trade, we can see a ready made opportunity for the Government to provide employment to many of those who have lost jobs in the construction industry.  The Government should examine all the applications for home improvement works for senior citizens in this regard.  My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, had a list today of all the local authorities that had made applications for further funding in that area, almost every local authority in the country.  If the Government was willing to take action in this regard and provide funding, we would instantly see an increase in employment throughout the country and at the same time address one of our major problems, namely, the loss of jobs in the construction industry.My colleague also raised the issue of county enterprise boards.  It is amazing that every county enterprise board ran out of funding after five months.  With regard to enterprise and industry, it is the county enterprise boards that will be the backbone of any improvement in our situation, yet there is no funding available for them.  We have been told the boards have funding for training, but there is no seed funding to generate jobs for the people they train.  It is mind-boggling that funds are available to train people, but once trained they must wait until next year for funding to help any new business get off the ground.I have heard another colleague, Senator Alan Kelly, comment on numerous occasions that no Department has a programme to follow up in this area or help move small and medium enterprises on to the next phase.  I hope the Minister will look at the positive aspects of putting funding in place for county enterprise boards and of ensuring grant aid is provided for the next stage of development for medium and small enterprises.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	480	Following last week's Government intervention on behalf of the banks, it is time to ask whether the Government will now show the same determination to bail out the Irish families who are about to lose their homes.  The need for this intervention was highlighted last night.  I re-emphasise the need for this intervention to save victims of the banks' greed, now that unemployment has hit these families.The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment spoke last night about the value of community employment schemes.  While these were valuable schemes, they were short term and the plan was that people would return to full employment.  Even in the best of times, that did not happen.  Now, there is even less opportunity for many of these people to return to full employment.  I raise this matter in the context of information provided to me by one of my constituents.  She is a separated mother of four who was given a mortgage of €150,000 while she was on a CE scheme.  What was that mortgage provider thinking of?  He is now waiting, vulture-like, at the door of the court to repossess her house.  The ones who suffer most are those who were force-fed mortgages by banks and mortgage providers in the good times.  Where was the Financial Regulator when this woman was gifted a mortgage that she could not possibly repay?I draw Members' attention to the plight of the hidden victims of the downturn.  When a factory closes and a large number of jobs are lost, the event rightly gets banner headlines, but when two or three are lost in the local shop or launderette, we do not hear about it because it never reaches the newspapers.  The people affected are also unemployed and still have to pay their mortgages, put bread on the table and look after their children.  The sense of isolation can be overwhelming for them because they do not even have the support of their colleagues when jobs are lost here or there.Yesterday a school principal in my constituency highlighted for me the number of parents who were asking to have payments deferred for basic school items.  The parents concerned cannot afford to pay because they have lost their jobs.  I estimate that an additional 1,100 people have become unemployed in Dublin South-Central since September in comparison with the same period in 2007.  The MABS reports being inundated with calls.  As I am not aware of any factory closures which would account for such a large number of job losses, I believe they are being eroded here and there.  However, the victims suffer in the same way as those laid off with 200 others and are equally entitled to be looked after.  The services have to reach out to them because they cannot rely on having somebody to support their cause.  They need to be helped in restoring their dignity and finding fresh full-time employment.The need for upskilling and retraining on foot of job losses in the construction has been highlighted by my colleagues.  Two proposals made in the Labour Party motion regarding the construction industry and the schools programme are worth rehearsing.  A number of schools in my constituency have been waiting seven years or more for extensions.  Inchicore primary school, Loreto primary school, Crumlin, the sports hall in Loreto College, Crumlin, and Our Lady's secondary school, Templeogue, are all waiting to commence their building projects.  This gap could be effectively filled by reintroducing a schools building programme.The insulation programme which my party has proposed could also offer value.  In the Dublin area Energy Action provides a high quality service.  Similar services are offered throughout the country.  It is time they were mainstreamed because they are dependent on funding from a variety of agencies.Since 1997 Fianna Fáil led Governments were happy to take credit for the Celtic tiger and its effects on the economy and employment.  It could be argued that the Government's bail-out of the banks was merely a case of returning the favour to the builders and their bankers.  It is time the Government acted in support of the Labour Party's proposals to get people back to work, prevent long-term unemployment, stimulate the economy and provide significant social and environmental gains.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I thank Deputy Penrose for tabling this important motion on unemployment and I am pleased to have the opportunity of addressing it.The financial crisis at home and abroad dominates the headlines, while the economic recession worsens.  The Government put €400 billion of taxpayer's money, or twice our annual GDP, on the line to bail out the banks and in so doing was applauded by the professional commentators for its brilliant and daring approach.  However, bank shares continue to spiral downwards and the credit crunch continues unabated because the banks have over extended with the construction industry, which is on the rocks, to the point where they have no national or international creditworthiness.Greed, big executive bonuses and dividends and a sleeping regulatory watchdog have done the banking system.  The Government should shut down the expensive €50 million plus quango that is the Office of the Financial Regulator, follow the example of the United Kingdom by taking advantage of the repressed financial market to take equity in the banks it is bailing out and establish an independent regulatory watchdog which would report directly to it to ensure proper financial regulation.  The prospect of a State third banking force, which the Labour Party advocated in the early 1990s, now seems a good idea.  It is hard to understand why the Government allowed the State-owned ACC Bank to be privatised in the 1990s and sold to Rabo Bank which is now an endangered species.These, however, are mere matters of money.  The real crisis and tragedy involves the 80,000 men and women who have lost their jobs in the past 12 months and the 300 who lose their jobs daily.  Job losses will continue to hit for a considerable period to come.  The ESRI predicts that another 100,000 will lose their jobs in 2009.  That is an appalling vista.  The Government was quick to respond to the financial turmoil with a bail-out last week and a budget next week but it has no employment policies or support strategies for the redundant workers who are the immediate victims of the recession.Threshold, the organisation for the homeless, told us yesterday that the number of illegal evictions trebled in the past 12 months because tenants who became unemployed could not make the rental payments to their landlords.  It called for the establishment of a short-term emergency fund to tide tenants over through the rainy days ahead and save the State money in the longer term.  On Monday, the first day of the new law term, applications for the repossession of homes and properties were the talking point of the courts.  The number seeking State support in meeting mortgage repayments has risen by 60% in the past 12 months and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service has experienced a 50% increase in the number of vulnerable people accessing its services.  This is the human tragedy that occurs when the unbridled market has its way and the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank go to sleep on the job.It is not the MABS or the Department of Social and Family Affairs which should be called upon to assist with loan repayments but the credit institutions which were prepared to break every rule in the book by granting excessive mortgages in the first place and turning home ownership into property portfolios.  The Government should compel them to restructure these mortgages over whatever period of time is necessary and tailor them to suit the current economic circumstances of the mortgage holder.  Under no circumstances should any bank or building society be allowed to foreclose on a family home.  The Government should give that guarantee to families.  No longer should the financial institutions be, as Walt Whitman wrote, willing to loan an umbrella on a sunny day and take it back when the rain starts to fall.Men and women who are losing their jobs must not be consigned to long-term unemployment, as happened in previous decades.  The Government must provide opportunities for them to engage in meaningful activities.  They must be offered the opportunity to return to education immediately through a revamped voluntary training opportunities scheme and back to education allowances.  They must also be offered opportunities to retrain and reskill immediately.  They need access to community employment schemes, jobs initiative schemes and local employment services.  The workers who produced the Celtic tiger should not become the first victims of the recession.  While efforts are being made to rebuild the economy, those who have lost their place in the workforce through no fault of their own must not be left on the scrap heap.  They must be facilitated in every way to return to the workforce at the earliest possible moment.  That should be the Government's immediate priority.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I was struck by two headlines in this week's newspapers.  The first concerned a banker whose organisation was one of the six banks in negotiations with the Government on its historic guarantee.  He bought 1 million shares for what he described as unknown reasons.  These shares increased in value but nothing was done about it.  On the same day another headline stated the number brought before the courts by the very banks which had sought to repossess their houses had increased to a level we had not seen in years.  Although these headlines contrast starkly with each other, they are the reality.  A banker whom the Government decided to bail out using our money was able to use this information to buy something which he knew would increase in value and nothing happens.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	484	People who have lost their jobs are about to lose their homes to the banks which they bailed out as taxpayers.  This Government is doing nothing about it.  These are the same people who were forced into working under C2s, although those of us who thought it was a bad idea not to pay tax when one was working told them not to do it and that in the long term it would not be good for them.  They now face a three-month waiting period to see whether they will receive unemployment assistance.  It will be assistance because they do not have any contributions.Unemployment in Cork is 12%, which is double the national average.  At the same time, we have one of the biggest brownfield sites in the country waiting for development.  However, this Government has dragged its heels on providing the infrastructure necessary for that to happen.  The unemployment figures continue to increase in Cork city and county.  In Cork county, we have the highest number of pupils in classes of 27 or more in the country.  In the county with the highest class sizes and highest unemployment figures, we have a junior Minister responsible for employment and we have the Minister for Education and Science, and still nothing is going to happen.This Government intends to bask in the glory of saving the banks.  That is it.  It was the only positive action that was taken by this Government and its members will bask in the glory of that until it all comes tumbling down around them.  People who are unemployed will quickly realise their money is to be used to shore up institutions that have done nothing for this economy and have only lined their own pockets.  I was sick of throwing letters into the fire offering my children loans of €20,000 and more.  They could have got them.  What the banks were doing was obscene.  People in this country do not only have mortgages to pay now that they are unemployed.  They also have car loans.  The repossessions have already started.  They have credit card debts.  We are more indebted than any other nation in Europe.  Yet the only thing the Government can think to do is to bail out the banks.We will wait and see the details of the bail-out next week.  Will there be any payback to the taxpayer?  Will we demand of the banks the type of sympathy we have shown to them when it comes to people who cannot pay their mortgages?  One householder owed €11,000.  I hear there are bankers in this country who earn that in a day.  They are so anxious to get their money that they are prepared to make people homeless in the process.  We are losing 300 jobs a day.  This Government is so fond of telling us about history, but that will be its legacy.  The people out there who find themselves unemployed tonight demand better and demand to know what this Government is going to do about it.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	485	When driving in through Dublin this morning past James's Street and Thomas Street, I saw a long queue on the footpath.  I wondered what the queue was, but I later found it was the queue for the unemployment exchange.  There were at least 50 people in the queue at 9.30 a.m.  When I got in here I rang my secretary in Limerick, and without my telling her what I had seen, she told me that this morning at around the same time she was on Parnell Street and saw a queue that was coming around the corner from the labour exchange in Dominick Street and down a long alleyway as far as Parnell Street.  There were at least 100 people in the queue, if not more.  I have no doubt these queues are reproduced around the country because we know that the number of unemployed is rapidly increasing.  We are back to the days of long dole queues.This Government has got to do something about it.  Its members cannot sit idly by and preen themselves proudly about what they have done for the banks.  These are real, individual people with real families and real lives.  Somebody should sit down and talk to every single one of them, instead of sitting behind a hatch and asking them their RSI numbers and maybe, if they are lucky, handing them out a few bob to keep them going.  Somebody should be talking to them about who they are, what they want, where they were working and where they might work again.  We cannot allow this to happen.  We need to match up the people who are unemployed with the work that needs to be done.  That is precisely what the Labour Party is proposing in terms of schemes for school buildings, for improving houses and so on.Last weekend I met a young apprentice plumber who had only three months left in a four-year apprenticeship when he was let go.  He had tried every other plumbing firm in the area and he could not get a job.  Those apprenticeships need to be picked up.  If there are no employers with whom these young people can finish their apprenticeships the State must do it.  There are jobs to be done.  I was in Limerick Senior College, a PLC college, this week.  Water was dripping in through the roof, but the summer works scheme is gone, and with it any chance of getting it fixed.  There is a school in Kilfinane, County Limerick, which has been mentioned in the House many times, in which the children must cross the yard to go to the toilet, but it is not on the list of the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, this year.We need to match the people being made unemployed with the work that needs to be done, and we need the Government to do this quickly because those people will become long-term unemployed if nobody talks to them or takes an interest in their individual cases before they lose hope.  I urge the Minister to be proactive in this regard.  We are making specific concrete proposals, but the Government needs to come forward with proposals as well.  The Government members are the people who have the power to make something happen for these real people with real lives.There are more than 3,000 people in my constituency working in Dell, but they do not know what will be happening in the future.  We will be raising this matter later on the Adjournment.  People in Shannon Airport, Dublin Airport and Cork Airport working for Aer Lingus do not know what is to happen to their jobs.  Many other people, including those in small firms as mentioned by my colleagues, do not know what will happen.  We need a practical, proactive response.  I am not talking about FÁS putting on a few courses that people may or may not find out about and which may or may not be suitable for them.  We need to focus on individuals and their needs, whether it be a FÁS course, a higher education course or a job somewhere they can fit into.  I am particularly concerned about construction workers.  I know many construction workers who spend their evenings online looking for jobs in the Middle East and Australia.  This should not be happening in a country that was so rich up to so recently.I urge the Government to do something practical about this.  In the area of health, there are physiotherapists qualifying this year from universities in Ireland who have already gone abroad because there are no jobs for them.  At the same time there are elderly people sitting at home who need physiotherapists and who are thinking they will have to go into an institution because they cannot move around in their own homes.  Their home help hours have been cut and they cannot get extensions, downstairs toilets or whatever they need to be able to stay at home, as mentioned by my colleague Deputy Ciarán Lynch earlier.  The Government needs to start matching the needs of the people with those of the economy, and it must do it quickly.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	486	One part of our motion is a proposal for a substantial programme of investment in skills and retraining, including the use of vacant places in universities and colleges.  I specifically want to talk about vacant places, namely, college places that are unfilled after the list of qualified applicants to the CAO for a particular course has been exhausted.  I printed out the available place course list for 2008 from the CAO website this evening.  As of today there are more than 100 courses advertised as having vacant places by the CAO.  There is no transparency as to exactly how many places are available.  I tried to get that information from the CAO by telephone recently but it could only tell me the number of courses.  When I asked the question of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, he replied that higher education institutions do not routinely provide information to his Department or the HEA on vacant places.  Those places are paid for by the taxpayer.  The equipment is paid for and the teachers are employed.  Those course places remain unfilled and are going to waste.  There is no transparency about that and there should be.Not only are those courses unfilled, but also the subjects they include are degree courses in universities and institutes of technology throughout the country.  I understand hundreds of those course places remain unfilled each year in subjects such as information technology, electronic and computer engineering, fishery management, environmental and natural resource management, business courses, law courses, etc.  While the Government refers to its objective to create a knowledge-based economy and to do something about job creation to address unemployment, it is allowing this to happen and all that unfulfilled potential to go to waste.The Labour Party is proposing that the utmost be done by the Government and its agencies to ensure those places are filled, particularly by people who are unemployed.  For example, a major sector is construction.  Former construction workers would have the opportunity to study for degrees in engineering, etc.  They could go on in the future and contribute to the knowledge-based economy and probably earn more in a more secure job than they had in construction.  If we do that, we need to ensure they are not to be like school leavers who are supported by their parents at home for four years.  We need to ensure people are offered these courses in a flexible way, taking into account that they might have families and other commitments.  We need to provide necessary financial supports to ensure they take up those places, which would be worth it in the long run.There is no promotion of those vacant places.  I am only aware of them because I used to work in the area of admissions and registrations in a third level college.  Last night, a bricklayer who has been unemployed for a year came to my clinic to ask about an issue related to his trade union.  I brought these courses to his attention.  He had never heard of them and was interested.  As his wife was also unemployed, I told him that if he took up the course he would get to keep his social welfare payments, would almost certainly qualify for a grant and would be able to get a qualification at the end.  That type of information is not provided to people.  There is no promotion of it and there is no urgency by the Government to do something about the issue.The agencies, including FÁS, the VECs, the various Departments and in particular the colleges, need to come together on this issue.  The colleges need to be made to do something about this matter.  The Government is allowing taxpayers' money to be wasted when we could be using these places to educate and upskill people to allow them contribute to the economy.  We also have vacant capacity in our second level schools and community colleges.  The same issue would also apply to post-leaving certificate courses.  We should use those unfilled places to educate our unemployed people.

While the motion makes some proposals, it is also interspersed with some negative ideas.  Obviously the situation of rising unemployment in which we find ourselves is of concern.  Reference was made to people queuing outside social welfare offices.  We do not want to go back to the days when people were in long-term unemployment in some cases for many years with many people emigrating.  We must acknowledge that Ireland is now in a different time.  In the 1980s there were large numbers of people on long-term unemployment with no prospect of any opportunities in the labour market.  In addition, large numbers of people were emigrating who did not have the skill sets to find employment abroad and often found themselves in very menial jobs.  We are in a different Ireland now.We acknowledge that challenges exist, including the global credit crisis.  It does not reflect well on the Labour Party to flippantly throw aside the bailout of the banks.  Reference to this was made in a roundabout way.  We had a huge increase in construction in recent times not only because of the demand for houses due to changing demographics and the major increase in the working population, but also access to cheap credit.  That was a fundamental factor in the housing boom.  People had access to cheap credit and there was a demand for houses.  I never saw Deputy Kathleen Lynch with her placard outside any building site in the country protesting that they should not be working there because it was owned by some landowner or speculator.  These were people who borrowed money and provided housing units and many job opportunities.  Dismissing these people as if every person——

The bailout is not a €400 million guarantee as if the money was handed over.  It was done to create stability and provide liquidity so that banks could operate in an economy where credit is available to people who want to invest in their small businesses, for house extensions or the purchase of a new house or car.  That is the purpose of the bailout.  It is not designed to bail out any wealthy bankers.  It is about creating an environment in which people can go about normal enterprise, which means occasionally visiting a bank to borrow money and subsequently repaying it.  That is the purpose of banking.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	521	The Government's response to the growing unemployment problem has been complacent and in many ways clueless.  Since the Government was returned to power an extra 86,000 people are now signing on the live register.  The steady stream of job losses has touched every corner of the country and every sector of employment.  The number of people signing on has doubled, or almost doubled, in a number of different places around the country, such as Castleblayney, Portarlington, Portlaoise and Macroom.  In large centres of population such as Cork city, the live register is up by 4,500 and by 2,500 in Waterford city, 3,000 in Limerick city, nearly 2,000 in Clondalkin and 1,800 in Blanchardstown and Mulhuddart, to name but a few.  It is against that type of background that the Labour Party has brought this motion to the House.For all that is stark about the present situation, there is plenty of action the Government could and should take to turn the situation around, and that is what I want to address.  The Government needs to take a three-pronged approach to the growing problem of unemployment.  First, it needs to ensure the income of every unemployed person provides him or her with security and adequate protection against poverty and indebtedness.  Second, it must immediately identify and provide for the training and education needs of all who have joined the live register.  Third, it needs to focus on creating new job opportunities so people can return to work as soon as possible.  It is critical that the Government focuses on ensuring that those who are losing their jobs do not become the long-term unemployed of the future.  As regards income, the Government must first come to terms with the realities of being unemployed.  It is not the same as it was in the 1980s.  If someone becomes unemployed today, he or she is much more likely to be struggling with mortgage repayments, credit card debt and higher purchase agreements and to incur arrears in rental and utility bills.  Recent statistics from MABS show there has been a 50% increase in the average level of debt among its clients since last year, and of course the number of clients is up by a third.  That means the Government must prioritise income adequacy in next week's budget and safeguard welfare payments.  In particular, the rules on mortgage interest supplement must be relaxed to reflect the realities of people living with high mortgages when they lose their employment.The second course of action must focus on education and training.  As a first step we need to obtain far greater information as regards the education and training needs of those on the live register.  There is a dearth of up to date information on education qualifications, skills deficits, language competency, nationality and so on.  For some on the live register, upskilling may mean completing a basic English or literacy course.  For others, such as construction workers, it could mean complete reskilling for a different area of employment or other types of work within a particular sector.  The Government should be instructing FÁS to gear up to meet the increased demand for its services and it needs to produce a much speedier response.  In addition, FÁS must examine the level of spare capacity that may exist in universities, as Deputy Tuffy has said, and in the institutes of technology and determine how those places might be matched to the needs of the unemployed.Government should increase the number of places on community employment and jobs initiative schemes, and it should relax the eligibility criteria for those schemes to make certain that new people joining the live register have the opportunity to ensure quickly they remain active and gain alternative work experience.  It should develop detailed information packs also for the new unemployed on issues as regards redundancy, training, education and welfare supports, because there is a real gap.  More than anything, there is a need to overhaul the rules on the back to education and the back to work enterprise allowances.  It makes no sense whatsoever that someone has to wait 12 months to become eligible for a back to education allowance or up to two years for the back to work enterprise allowance.  Recent changes in relation to entitlement for people who have received statutory redundancy, while welcome, are not enough as thousands have had to sign on in recent times without receiving statutory redundancy payments at all.  It should be possible for an unemployed person to avail of these schemes if he or she has not been able to find alternative employment within, say, a three month period.  It serves no one's interest to wait until we have a serious long-term unemployment problem before these types of departmental supports become available.The third strand of Government action must revolve around the creation of employment opportunities.  The Government could put many of the jobless construction workers back to work, for example, by restarting and expanding the schools building programme and by investing in a national insulation programme.  There is a crying need, especially among older residents, for homes to be upgraded in respect of insulation.  It would be a win-win situation for all if the Government embarked on such a programme.The Government also needs to strengthen early warning systems for imminent job losses and put together a crack team of business, finance and human resource experts to assist small and medium companies to downsize instead of going out of business altogether.  We need to look at ways family friendly measures might reduce the numbers of unemployed while also facilitating young parents.  Finally, there must be guaranteed access to local employment services for all of those who find themselves on the live register.  The Government has lost too much time talking about soft landings.  The hard truth is that we have a serious unemployment problem again on our hands and it is time the Government faced up to that.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I thank all Members who contributed to the debate on this Labour Party motion, and I compliment my colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, for tabling the motion.We have been talking here over the last couple of weeks about serious problems in the economy, and more recently the banking crisis.  However, there is a jobs crisis in this country that has been going on for months and no significant action by Government has been taken to deal with it.  If anyone wants to see the extent to which the Government is in denial about the scale of the unemployment problem facing the country, all he or she has to do is read the pathetic amendment to the Labour Party motion tabled by the Tánaiste and listen to her pathetic contribution yesterday and that of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, this evening.  None of them could put forward a single significant new idea or initiative to deal with the unemployment crisis.  As far as the Government is concerned, it is business as usual.  To add insult to injury, for the 80,000 who have lost their jobs in the past year, the Tánaiste is asking the Dáil in her amendment to "commend the Government" for its stewardship of the economy and the employment market to date.The statistics are shocking.  The live register has increased by nearly 80,000 over the past 12 months, an increase of almost 50%.  The live register unemployment rate has jumped from 4.6% to 6.3% in less than 12 months.  The ESRI's commentary on the labour market is revealing.  The deterioration in the early part of this year was particularly remarkable and the ESRI is now predicting that employment will be 3% lower in 2009 than in 2007.  Unemployment is expected to rise to 8% in 2009 and evidence is starting to come through of the labour force falling as participation falls.  The problem is widespread across the country.  A brief glance down the numbers of those signing on in each local office is deeply worrying — an extra 4,000 in Donegal, 4,300 in Galway, 3,000 in Waterford, and this is just a random sample.This is a cause of real hardship and distress for people, those who have mortgages, loans and all types of other commitments who are facing really hard times and choices.  If a job is lost, will a child have to be taken out of playschool to save the money?  Does one or other partner have to leave and look for work abroad?  What happens the house?  It cannot be sold, and even if it could, who would pay the negative equity?The Government is preparing a hairshirt budget, but is ignoring the underlying cause of the problem, which is the real economy.  The cause of the problem in the public finances is the recession in the real economy, not the other way around.  Getting people back to work will bring in tax revenues and save on social welfare payments.  Just look at that great work or fiction, the 2008 budget: a single person on €35,000, not far off the average industrial wage, pays €303 in PRSI, €700 in levies and €1,510 in tax, if he or she is working.  If he or she loses a job the State has to pay about €10,500 in job seeker's allowance, before any other form of housing assistance or benefit.  The net gain to the State of every job created at that wage level is at least €13,500 or, looking at it the other way around, the total cost to the Exchequer of the 80,000 jobs lost in the past year is approximately €1 billion.  Creating a job at €45,000 results in a saving of more than €20,000 for a single person and that does not include savings for qualified adults, housing related payments or VAT on money spent from wages.The lesson is simple.  A strategy is needed to get people back to work and it is clear that the Government has no coherent or determined strategy to deal with the issue.  It has spent months focused on the public finances but there is no jobs strategy.  It must be a matter of deep disquiet that at the time we most need FÁS to gear up to deal with the crisis, the organisation is mired in internal audit difficulties.  This matter is too serious to wait for months while FÁS sorts itself out.  A major skills programme is needed now to address the needs of those losing their jobs.The expert group on future skills needs concluded there is a need to upskill at least 500,000 people over the next decade and now is the time to start.  Many of the people losing jobs in construction have limited formal qualifications and they may have highly sector-specific skills.  Now is the time to address their needs and those of many others losing their jobs, including professionals, such as engineers, architects and lawyers.  A major co-ordinated programme which makes use of all available capacity in training and educational facilities is required.  It must bring together agencies and Departments, with strong political leadership.  If hard decisions have to be taken, that must be done.  The Government can also take targeted initiatives that will have an impact on employment.The Labour Party has called for some time for the acceleration of the schools building programme that would utilise the skills of people losing their jobs in the construction industry.  Sometimes when we raise this, we are asked where we will generate the money required.  These projects could save the State money because they could proceed using a different approach to financing.  When I was in Cork South-West with my colleague, Senator Michael McCarthy, last Friday, I visited Gaelscoil Chloch na gCoillte in Clonakilty.  It is a fine school serving 240 students who are all accommodated in prefab buildings in the school yard.  The school administrators have a site and they appointed project engineers in anticipation of approval of their project, but then the money was pulled.  The school principal and the board of management understand fully that the money is not available from the Department of Education and Science.  However, they have suggested to the Department that if they were allowed to take out a mortgage, they could build the school and the repayments on the mortgage would be less than the rent paid by the Department for the prefabs.

The VEC has concluded an arrangement with Dún Laoghaoire-Rathdown County Council for funding of the scheme.  All that is needed is the approval of the Department.  If the Government could see its way to invest the same confidence in the principal and the board of management of the school in Clonakilty that it has invested in overpaid bank executives, some of the schools building programme could proceed without additional cost to the taxpayer, thereby providing schools that are needed and employment for construction workers while addressing the educational and skills needs required long term to move the economy forward.The problem is the Government is too short-sighted in what it is doing about employment.  This is a major issue because it is the people end of what is happening to the economy and it is a matter of deep regret that the Government is not taking it with more seriousness and urgency.

This is a critical issue for the people in Limerick.  Some 3,000 staff in Dell are worried about their jobs and their futures in Limerick.  There is no person in Limerick without a family member, neighbour or friend working in Dell, or in some way associated with it.  The company is an integral part of Limerick and has been a fantastic employer.  We want it to continue to be so.There has been a veil of silence from the Government regarding the future of Dell.  In view of the growing uncertainty and confusion about the future of the company, it requires urgent clarification.  I ask the Tánaiste to give a comprehensive statement, even though she is not in the Chamber.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is in the Chamber and I mean no disrespect to him but this is of such grave importance to Limerick and requires clarification that the Tánaiste should be here.I raised the matter yesterday when both the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach were present.  I asked if the Tánaiste could confirm or deny if she or any member of the Government were contacted directly or indirectly by Dell about the future plans for the Limerick plant and what steps she would take to avert what would be an appalling disaster for Limerick and the mid-west.  I seek a comprehensive statement on this issue.  I wrote to the Taoiseach on 12 September, over three weeks ago.  I received a response on 25 September and it was like getting a response from the HSE.  It was passed onto the Tánaiste and I have yet to receive a reply from her.  Dell is a great employer for the area with over 3,000 staff and of interest to thousands more.  The Government must clear the air for once and for all and spell out exactly what is Dell's position and what steps it has taken to avert this crisis.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Like Deputy O'Donnell I am very disappointed that the Tánaiste has not come to the House tonight.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, will be able to give us answers.  We need them and we also need action because there are over 3,000 people working for Dell.  It is a very significant employer for the region and is extremely important not only for those directly employed but for a number of other companies that feed into or out of it.  A considerable number of families are dependent on Dell.  We have heard a variety of stories in the international press stating that there is a question mark over Dell worldwide, and specifically over the Limerick plant.I tabled a question to the Minister last week and she told me that the IDA has been engaged in extensive discussions with the company at the highest level and that she has been fully briefed.  She has not told us more than that, however.  We must know more and the workers in particular must know exactly what is happening.  I urge the Minister to clarify the situation.  I will go further than that.  I want the Minister to go to Dell headquarters and talk to the company, to assure them, first, of its importance in Ireland and also of its productivity.  Dell has been good to Limerick but Limerick has been good to Dell.  It has produced a fine productive work force and that basis has enabled Dell to go to other countries and set up plants in them.  Limerick cannot now be let down by Dell.I am convinced that if the Minister went to the company and assured it of the full support of the Government and of governmental concern that the plant be maintained in Ireland, then there would be a successful outcome.  We see Ministers going to all parts of the world trying to attract industry here.  Surely it is much more important, or at least as important, to go to companies when there is a question mark over them and make sure to take proactive action.  It is better to do that before we get to a situation wringing our hands because the company has made an announcement that cannot be turned around.  I urge the Minister to go to Dell, express these concerns and offer the full support of the Government in maintaining the plant in Limerick.

It is a very sensitive issue for both of them in that Dell is located in Limerick.Dell is undertaking a fundamental review of its global manufacturing operations.  That is well known and has been in the public domain for some time.  IDA Ireland will keep in contact with its client companies in Ireland in the context of any global review being carried out.  I can confirm that the IDA has been in close discussions and contact with Dell concerning the Limerick operation.

Her absence from the House tonight is in no way a disrespect to the concerns of the workers or to the Deputies opposite who have raised the matter.This issue is very sensitive.  Discussions with companies such as this are done on a confidential basis.  When the IDA goes abroad and attracts companies into this country, as it has been doing very successfully down the years, all remains on a confidential basis until such time as contracts are drawn up and an announcement is made.  Equally, when the IDA is in discussions with a client company that is reviewing its global operations, we must respect the confidentiality of that company and of the IDA in making sure that they can go about their business.  The Government is fully committed to ensuring that we have facilities such as Dell and other global operators in this country.It has been a successful strategy and the IDA has been very successful in attracting business into this country, particularly in the ICT sector.  We all know the importance of Dell and of many other global companies that are located in Ireland.  It is a considerable employment base and is equally important in the context of our net exports.  We are fully aware of the importance of Dell and of other companies and are committed to ensuring that Dell remains in Limerick and, in general, that other companies remain in Ireland.For that reason we are trying to ensure that we remain competitive and are seen as an attractive location.  We have reduced corporation tax and have a highly educated, skilled, mobile and flexible workforce.  We must ensure the continuance of those key ingredients that first attracted companies such as Dell and many other multinationals into this country.  The Government is continually investing in education, up-skilling and re-training.  It also makes sure that there is flexibility in the workforce——

We have considerable competition from other countries such as Puerto Rico, Singapore and elsewhere that have reduced corporation tax, where there is a highly flexible and educated workforce and huge sums are being invested in infrastructure in order to attract businesses.  We are competing globally against those countries.  Anything that we can do we will do.  Equally, the Deputy should understand, and I hope he respects, the need to ensure that confidentiality in any discussions that take place——

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I would appreciate if the Acting Chairman let me know when four minutes are up.  I wish to share the last minute with Deputy Jimmy Deenihan who now has an interest in the area because of the change in constituencies.The flooding in Newcastle West on 1 August was devastating.  It was frightening.  Most of the population of Newcastle West was present to see what happened.  Such a deluge was never seen in living memory in the area, perhaps never.  We challenge the Government to engage immediately with the people of Newcastle West who have had their premises damaged and who require assistance. Rather than passively saying that it is available to listen, the Government should engage actively with the committee which represents the victims of the flood.The weather on the days leading up to 1 August was wet.  Persistent rainfall resulted in a saturated catchment.  This was revealed by soil deposits as calculated by Met Éireann.  Eyewitness accounts and rainfall radar images indicate that the rain began at around 7.30 p.m. on 31 July and continued until approximately 1.30 a.m.  on 1 August, giving a storm duration of six hours.  Premises and houses  were destroyed.  The committee reckoned that up to 200 houses and properties, including business properties, were damaged.  The damage cost for that single night is estimated at up to €40 million.   Many houses were not insured either because they were owned by elderly people or for a variety of other reasons.  People went out of business as a result of the destruction of premises.The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, visited the following evening and saw for himself the devastation in the area of Newcastle West.  I visited the following morning with Councillor Jerome Scanlon and saw the damage at first hand before any clear up was attempted.  It was so devastating that water six feet deep flowed down streets that never had been flooded previously.  Met Éireann has shown that the eye of the storm travelled from Cork towards Newcastle West where it stopped for six hours before moving on.  This is what caused the problem.I want to ensure two things in respect of the Government's response to the needs that exist.  First, the authorities in Northern Ireland responded immediately in an interim fashion by offering £1,000 sterling to the victims of flooding in the North.  There is adequate precedent for assisting victims of flooding in Ireland in locations such as Fermoy, Drumcondra and other areas of Dublin and I ask the Minister of State to respond in this regard.  Second, I ask that the Office of Public Works, OPW, will ensure that everything is done so that were such an event to recur, the system will be able to take it.  While the OPW has stated it is a once in 650 years chance, it could happen again next year as it also is a twice in 1,300 years chance.  Concerns have been expressed about some bridges and rivers and I ask that the Minister of State's office will make every effort to ensure no finance will be spared in respect of anything that can be done.  This should be done without any consideration of the public purse.  Finally, as Limerick County Council will incur a massive financial bill on this issue, the Government must respond to it.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I wish to inform the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, that major problems also occurred in Athea, County Limerick, which is close by.  The people of Athea were somewhat disappointed the Minister of State did not visit them because a number of families there were flooded and were obliged to leave their houses.  They felt somewhat isolated and believe they did not receive the attention they deserved.The river at Athea is completely overgrown and obviously has not been maintained for some time.  I visited the location on the day after the flooding and although the local OPW carried out some temporary work, unless the river is included in the agency's arterial drainage scheme by virtue of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, which must be amended, it has no responsibility for it.  This must be considered seriously because someone must take responsibility for rivers, especially when they threaten houses, the local population and perhaps even lives.  While the Minister of State visited Newcastle West, I do not know whether he has done anything since about what happened there.  However, if he intends to take measures, he also should think of the people of Athea.I thank Kerry County Council for providing sandbags to the people of Athea, thus demonstrating that people can work together.  This ensures that were any further problems to arise, they at least would have the sandbags to make them more secure and so on.  I thank Deputy Neville for allowing me some time.

While many locations have been affected by serious flood events in recent weeks, it was particularly severe in Newcastle West.  Having seen at first hand the devastation caused in the town on the night of 31 July and 1 August and having spoken to people affected by the flooding there and in other parts of the country, I am very aware of the hardship and loss they have suffered.  I am glad to have the opportunity to place on the record of the House my personal sympathy and concern as well as that of the Government for the victims of the flooding.  I certainly am thankful there was no loss of life because in Newcastle West in particular, there was some danger of this.It is only by seeing the situation at first hand, as I did when I visited Newcastle West and a number of other locations that also experienced severe flooding, that it is possible to get a full sense of the hardship and worry flooding causes.  The Office of Public Works and I are acutely aware of the impact of flooding and we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate it through the provision of defences to best practice standards to reduce existing flood risk and by taking steps to prevent the creation of future risk.  This is not the time to go into detail on those matters as time is limited and the topic under discussion is the flooding in Newcastle West and the surrounding area, as well as in Athea.This summer has seen unprecedented levels of rainfall occur in many places.  It has been estimated that the rainfall that fell on Newcastle West would be expected to occur once in 650 years, although I should qualify that by stating that experts caution that the degree of confidence that one can have in such an extreme statistic is very limited.  The chairman of South Tipperary County Council, who was brought up in Newcastle West as a boy, told me there was a flood, albeit not as serious as the most recent event, back in 1947.

The River Arra, which flows through the town, is part of the River Feale catchment and is therefore maintained on a regular basis by the Office of Public Works.  Prior to the flood it had been maintained in 2006 and would have coped comfortably with the normal rainfall for the area.  The rainfall on the night, however, was, as I noted already, far beyond the norm.  As a result, the flood was not contained within the river walls and banks, thus causing the devastation that is now well documented.  The OPW has carried out further maintenance works on the channel through the town to remove any debris or vegetation that might impede flows in the river in future flood conditions.The OPW also has commenced a detailed analysis of the 1 August flood event with a view to identifying options that might reduce the likelihood of flooding.  The findings of the study recently commissioned by Limerick County Council on the flooding will be taken into account in this analysis.  The aim of the analysis would be to ensure the town has the level of immunity from flooding that would generally be provided by the OPW's flood relief schemes.  This would provide protection from flood events of a severity that would be expected to occur once in every 100 years.  Preliminary analysis has indicated that there may be stretches of the channel where this level of protection is not available at present.  If this proves to be the case, my office will work with Limerick County Council to have the necessary works carried out, provided these are acceptable on economic and environmental grounds.  I will endeavour to ensure that, notwithstanding the current difficult financial and economic conditions, funding will be available to allow works to proceed as soon as possible.I am conscious that in addition to the trauma caused by the flooding, people also suffered financial loss arising from the damage caused to their property.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs has responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance where it is considered appropriate and is providing help through the community welfare officer network to victims of the recent flooding.  It is hoped that since Newcastle West has not experienced flooding in recent memory, most of the losses sustained by victims will be covered by insurance.  However, people who are suffering hardship should contact the local community welfare officer for assistance and each case will be dealt with confidentially and on its merits.  Recent humanitarian assistance schemes have not extended to cover business or agriculture.I assure the House that the Office of Public Works will continue to work in partnership with Limerick County Council to try to alleviate the risk of future flooding in Newcastle West and the surrounding areas.  OPW officials already have attended meetings of Newcastle West Town Council and a public meeting in the town to give information to councillors and the public on the position.  The OPW will continue, through the council, to make relevant information available and in particular will work to try to ensure Newcastle West is protected from a flood that has a 1% probability of occurrence and therefore has the same level of protection as other areas of the country at risk from river flooding.I should also state that the OPW is aware of the flooding that occurred in Athea, County Limerick, on the same day as the flooding in Newcastle West.  The flooding did not occur from a channel for which the Office of Public Works has responsibility but notwithstanding this, the OPW did provide assistance to the council with the clean-up after the event.I conclude by again expressing my sympathy to the victims of the flooding in Newcastle West and surrounding areas——

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	560	A Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, recently called for 8,000 redundancies in the public service and many can be taken from the Department responsible for the marine.  They should start at the top.  In 2003, Deputy Dermot Ahern was Minister responsible for the marine and he said on 17 July of that year that he would close Dublin Coast Guard station and expand those at Valentia and Malin.  On 21 October 2003, the Minister announced in the Oireachtas the closure of Dublin coastal radio station and the expansion of both Valentia and Malin coastal radio stations.In the intervening five years, the Civil Service has set about undermining this announcement by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in several ways.  We have heard about the Fearon report but there is no such thing.  It is an amalgamation of statements, assumptions and assertions from Kirwan, Livingstone and Mullen.  It is a prime example of what the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, was talking about — the Civil Service telling the Minister what to do, the tail wagging the dog.I have no ill-will towards the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  From studying the available facts, including times and dates from the past five years, it seems civil servants have made themselves the judges of their own case and cause.In 2003, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated in the Dáil that the station in Dublin would be closed and those in Malin and Valentia would be expanded.  Since then the civil servants have set out to scupper that announcement.  If senior civil servants manage to get their equipment installed in Dublin, they will have succeeded in accomplishing a complete reversal of Government policy.  The policy as announced by the Minister in 2003 stated that Valentia and Malin Head stations would be expanded and the Dublin station would be closed.  The policy has not been changed and proof of that comes from the Ceann Comhairle, a south Kerry man, and Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, who was Minister of State at the time.If the equipment goes into Dublin, the station's future is secured and the future of both Valentia and Malin will be jeopardised.  This is a perfect example of what the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, referred to recently and what led another Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, on "The Week in Politics" on RTE last Sunday night, to remark that the service resembles Humphrey from the satirical comedy "Yes Minister".If this is allowed by Government, what else is happening behind the closed doors of various Departments?  Staff at both Valentia and Malin believe the west coast station is only a smokescreen to allow a single centre to be set up in Dublin, which is what those civil servants wanted from the beginning.  If the station in Dublin is operational they will find reasons for not progressing the west coast station, just as they found reasons to close Valentia and Malin.

I put it to the Minister of State that if the report is implemented in its present lay-out, whereby there will be a station in Dublin and Shannon, with Malin and Valentia continuing as they are, over the next 15 years there will be a cost of €50 million on aggregate.  This will go to paying the people and running both those stations, which will be doing nothing.The senior manager of the British Coast Guard station, Mr. Jim Patton, has described Valentia as the finest station he has seen in the UK or Ireland.  It is the fourth largest in the British Isles.

The Government is trying to go into two of the most remote parts of this island and dig out civil servant jobs.  It is unprecedented and is a detachment from common sense.  It shows the Government has little evidence of prudence or leadership.Any time during the past 15 years when a decision had to be made, the Government hired a consultant.  With regard to the future of the Irish Coast Guard, we commissioned Deloitte & Touche at a cost of €140,000 of taxpayers' money.  It came up with a very specific recommendation, which was to keep the two stations at Valentia and Malin Head, build on existing capacity and work with the two stations.  Now, however, everything has changed.  Internal judgments have been made by a handful of civil servants making allegations of inadequate infrastructure, ESB supply, broadband and amenities, but these have been flatly and roundly refuted by experts throughout the country.The central element of this debate concerns saving lives and for over 100 years that has been the role of paid officers and volunteers at both Valentia and Malin Head.  The present crews and those gone before have excelled at this job and handed down their rich experience and knowledge of saving lives.  There is no good reason to change what we have but there is a good reason to keep it.  It has been working, the people have been saving lives and the wheel is not broken.  Why, therefore, are we considering changing it?

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	574	There is an element of the argument that has not been articulated by the Minister or the civil servants.  Speaking from a technological perspective, we could locate one centre in New Delhi if we decided to do so because of advanced communication.  However, technology is not the issue, it goes much deeper.  This is about respecting the sea.  If the mindset of the Government disrespects communities and a way of life, how in the name of God will it respect the sea?  It is that simple.This is not a parochial issue concerning just Kerry or Donegal.  We live on an island that has been manned by two stations — ten years ago Valentia and Malin Head manned these stations on their own.  Malin Head worked in conjunction with Belfast coast guard station and has intrinsic links with it.  Internationally, Malin Head station has links with Ayr in Scotland and Valentia has intrinsic links with Spain.  It is an international issue that we are trying to pull apart, a network of knowledge, familiarisation and experience with the sea.Will we open a new centre on the west coast in an urban location?  Will we introduce academics, people with masters degrees and PhDs, to it?  Is the plan to give away the link with coastal communities, fishermen and people who know the sea?  Computers cannot take account of tidal flows which are sometimes erratic.  The knowledge and experience of people living on our coastline is needed.The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is a conscientious man who fears lives will be lost if we do not change.  If, however, he chooses to change the system, lives will be lost.The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is responsible for the Office of Public Works.  Does he want to preside over the procurement of more lands and the construction of a new centre in Limerick when next Tuesday's budget will make cutbacks in other Departments?  Will the vital link with the people who know the sea be broken?  Will we rely on those who learn about the sea from books?  The issue at stake is one of maintaining communities and saving lives.  Does the Government want to place lives in jeopardy?  I do not believe that is the case.  It is time it showed leadership rather than allowing civil servants take a hand at them by producing nonsensical documents.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	575	On Sunday last, on RTE's "Six One News" an excerpt from "The Week in Politics" was broadcast in which the Minister for bad news, the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, announced the co-ordination centres at Malin Head and Valentia would be phased out and staff would not be replaced as they retire.  He also stated two new centres would be established in Dublin and Shannon, respectively.  On Monday, the director of the Coast Guard gave verbal indications to staff in Dublin that there would be another centre at Shannon and two other centres would be phased out as staff retire.  No notification was given to staff in Valentia and Malin Head or their families.  The absence of a warning has caused great distress and confusion among staff and their families.Without staff, who will man the new centre?  Who will control the west coast and what will the staff at Malin Head and Valentia do?  If it is still intended to use the Malin Head and Valentia centres to co-ordinate while the facility at Shannon is being phased in, will they continue to operate obsolete equipment?  A decision to upgrade the Valentia and Malin Head Coast Guard co-ordination centres with new equipment was taken five years ago by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  The failure by management of the Irish Coast Guard and the Department of Transport to replace this obsolete equipment has placed the lives of mariners at risk.Clearly, those who made the decision to phase out the centres at Malin Head and Valentia have never worked in a co-ordination centre.  They have no idea of the practical operational implications of reducing the number of Coast Guard stations and have based their decision on information which has been proven to be false.  It is wrong, for example, that the facilities in question lack staff and have poor communications, ESB infrastructure and local facilities.Value for money is an important issue in the current climate.  The decision on the Malin Head and Valentia centres will result in a building, including equipment and infrastructure worth millions of euro, being left idle in Shannon for years until staff in the other two stations have retired.  Given that radio equipment will remain in the buildings in Valentia and Malin Head, additional costs will be generated as it will be necessary to route back to this equipment from Shannon.  In addition, the new staff in Shannon will not include senior experienced radio officers to mentor and coach them over time.  This does not ignore their induction training.The local knowledge and experience built up over decades at Valentia, which is vital in co-ordinating the appropriate timely response in any incident throughout the Valentia division, will be lost to the country.  The Valentia station co-ordinates to a distance of 200 miles west.The Minister of State will, I believe, fully appreciate the importance of the Coast Guard stations in Malin Head and Valentia.  The decision to phase out these centres will have devastating repercussions for local communities.  It should be feasible using modern technology to locate a centre anywhere.  If it is possible to locate a facility in Dublin, why not improve the centres in Valentia and Malin Head?

Policy should be based on the independent Deloitte & Touche report of 2003.

I am familiar with both parts of the country and respect the service the centres have provided.  While I understand the passion of the Deputies opposite, I wish to set out the current position with regard to proposals which have been reported.The Deloitte & Touche study carried out in 2002 on the Irish Coast Guard provided a backdrop for ongoing improvements and developments in the Coast Guard over the past six years.  A number of recommendations are strategic, including reducing the number of rescue co-ordination centres from the current three to two enhanced centres.  The most economical option identified by the consultants was one single co-ordination centre to run the entire country, with a reserve centre nearby, which could be quickly activated if the main centre was out of commission and would also double as a training facility.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	578	That is not true.  The Deloitte & Touche report did not say that.

The consultants suggested three possible scenarios.  These were to build two new centres, to use and upgrade one existing centre and build one new centre or to use and upgrade two of the existing centres.  These are the options under consideration and no decision has yet been finalised on this matter.The Irish Coast Guard of the Department of Transport provides for marine emergency management, including search and rescue, ship distress and pollution response.  Central to this function is the Coast Guard's ability to receive and respond to emergency calls through its co-ordination centres.  However, key equipment is dated and in urgent need of replacement.  The Minister has given approval for the process of investment in a new integrated communications system and tenders have been invited.

This means a significant increase in the size, organisation and facilities needed in a marine rescue sub-centre, its buildings and support facilities.What is envisaged is a modern, efficient and flexible national co-ordination centre in line with best international standards to meet our needs for the 21st century.  None of the current centres is currently up to this challenge and solutions are needed.

A significant element of local knowledge comes from the local Coast Guard units and lifeboat crews strategically positioned all around the coast.  Their local knowledge of tides, currents, bays and local historical incident locations is invaluable to the Coast Guard watch officers at the centres.  Neither do the recommendations involve any diminution in radio coverage or the extent of radio receiving and transmitting equipment.  No matter what decision is taken, all existing sites, including those at Malin and Valentia, will be retained as radio sites.

The draft legislation provides regulatory framework to allow for the broadcasting of the film channel, under the aegis of the Irish Film Board, that will showcase Irish, European and world film on a free-to-air basis by Digital Television Transmission (DTT).As this legislation is currently before the House, further comment by me at this stage would be inappropriate. However, on the passing of the Bill I will consider in consultation with the Irish Film Board what initiative needs to be taken in relation to any such film channel within the available financial resources.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	621	Since the National Museum of Ireland became an autonomous statutory body under the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997 on 3rd May 2005, the Board of the National Museum is statutorily responsible for operational matters concerning its collection and I, as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, do not have a statutory function in respect of operational matters.I understand that the National Museum has decided to display some of the Natural History collection in the Riding School, Collins Barracks from the end of January 2009, when other exhibitions taking place in or already scheduled for the Riding School will have ended. The National Museum of Ireland also intends to carry out long-needed conservation works on many of the exhibits in the Natural History Museum and the opportunity to address this work, which is provided by the closure of the Museum for repairs and redevelopment, will be fully utilised.As negotiations are on-going in relation to the National Museum's storage requirements, including the requirements for the decantation of the Natural History Museum, it would be inappropriate to give further details at this time. Clearly the proposed expenditure on these projects will be dependent on the current Estimates process and in the context of the overall Exchequer position.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	622	As the Deputy will be aware, immigration policy is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its implementation is a matter for the relevant authorities, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.Tourism Ireland has made my Department aware of some incidents where visitors encountered difficulties entering Ireland. The main thrust of Tourism Ireland's communications was to put forward some ideas for discussion in respect of the implementation of immigration policy as it impacts on the promotion of inbound tourism.My Department in turn has engaged with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to these issues. While any such difficulties and misunderstandings are regrettable, it must be recognised that the number of such incidents has not been significant when seen in the light of over 8 million overseas visitors coming to Ireland in 2007.  This performance clearly demonstrates that the vast majority of visitors experience few difficulties entering Ireland.Furthermore, the valuable and largely unrecognised work done by the Gardaí in assisting visitors to Ireland from all countries should also be acknowledged.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The Agreed Programme for Government commits to the roll out of the Local Sports Partnership programme on a nationwide basis to provide for the development of sport at local level.  The Irish Sports Council has a statutory role in the promotion and development of sport, including initiatives such as the Local Sports Partnership network, through which sports initiatives at local level are delivered and coordinated.The Local Sports Partnerships are charged with increasing participation at a local level, ensuring that local resources are used to best effect and making sure that the experiences of participants in sport are positive.Following an independent review of the LSPs by Fitzpatrick Associates in 2005, the then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, gave approval to the ISC to extend the LSP network from 2006 on a national basis.  Accordingly, funding has been provided to the ISC to facilitate continued extension of the network.The ISC has informed me that 33 LSPs have been established in the following locations: Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork City, County Cork, Donegal, Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Galway City, Galway County, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick City, Limerick County, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, North Tipperary, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South County Dublin, South Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.The Fitzpatrick Report identified the need for the introduction of a formal monitoring and evaluation framework for the LSPs. In April 2008 the Irish Sports Council published the first SPEAK report detailing the work of the Local Sports Partnerships and its evaluation of the impact that this has on the clubs and communities across the country.The ISC recognises the importance of the use of an enjoyable multi-sport and non-competitive model to introduce our children to sport that will complement and enhance both our school and community sport programmes.  With this in mind the Council has developed the Buntús Programmes (Generic and Start), which are exciting programmes developed to support teachers and childcare practitioners in introducing young people to sport and physical activity. The programmes are rolled out through the Local Sports Partnerships.456,000 children have participated in Buntús and Buntús Start.  These schools and playgroups have a 48% female attendance, therefore it is estimated that more than 220,000 girls have participated in the programme.In addition to the Buntús programme, other programmes such as "Girls Active" in Sligo/Donegal and "Teen Scene" in Kerry target girls in 2nd level schools and youth clubs. These are initiatives developed between LSPs and local agencies.I look forward to the Local Sports Partnership Network having a major impact at local level in introducing our people, particularly the young, to sport and physical activity.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 143, 151, 178 and 180 together.Since 1998, over €700 million has been provided for the development of sporting facilities at national, regional and local levels. Through this investment my Department is  funding the development of a network of top quality facilities around the country designed to meet the training, coaching and competition needs of our elite competitors in a wide spectrum of sports. Among the major projects, which have been supported are the National Aquatic Centre, the National Rowing Centre at Inniscarra, the National Tennis Centre at Glasnevin, the National Boxing Stadium and the National Hockey Stadium at UCD and a number of athletic facilities throughout the country.The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, has statutory responsibility for encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport.  In this regard the ISC works in partnership with the Irish Institute of Sport, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Paralympic Council of Ireland and the relevant governing bodies of sport in the preparation of Irish athletes for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.The planning for the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games was comprehensive and well funded with plans implemented by top quality professionals at every step.  The performances of the Irish Olympic and Paralympic teams in Beijing exceeded the targets set by the ISC prior to the Games.I understand that the ISC has established a review group to examine the preparations and performances at the 2008 Beijing Games in order to prepare for the 2012 London Games.  The overall aim of the review is to make recommendations to the ISC in respect of structures, programmes and investment policy which should be pursued based on the outcomes of the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games.I also intend to meet with the key stakeholders involved in the support of our elite athletes to discuss how we can best build on the success we had in Beijing and the supports required in terms of coaching, programmes, facilities and funding to ensure the optimum performance of Irish athletes at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 137, 139 and 280 together.Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.Applications for funding under the 2008 Programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on 13th and 14th of January 2008 and the deadline for receipt of applications was 29th February for paper-based applications and 7th March for online applications.  A total of 1,453 applications were received under the 2008 programme.  I announced the provisional grant allocations at the end of July and a list of the allocations is available on the Department's website at www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie.In excess of €725m has been allocated in sports capital funding since 1998 to 7,401 sports projects and has supported the provision of greatly enhanced sports infrastructure across the country.  I am satisfied that the level of allocation provided in 2008 builds on the very high levels of support provided over the past decade and will further assist in the development of sports facilities.  I do not propose at this point that there will be any further allocations under the Sports Capital Programme in 2008.  The date of the next round of the Programme has not yet been decided.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 176 together.The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001 for the purpose of giving support to both racing industries. Under the provisions of the Act, the Fund is calculated on the basis of excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 amount adjusted for inflation. Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty is made up by direct Exchequer subvention.In accordance with the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, 80% and 20% of the moneys paid into the Fund each year are distributed between Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and Bord na gCon respectively. By the end of 2008, a total of almost €546 million will have been paid out of the Fund. Of this, HRI will have received €437 million and Bord na gCon will have received €109 million.Since 2001, income from the Fund has been used by both bodies towards increasing prize money levels, meeting administration and integrity costs together with a programme of capital investment which has underpinned a significant growth in both sectors.Since the establishment of the Fund a major period of development of both industries has resulted. The funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing and greyhound racing.In 2004, HRI launched a €250 million Capital Development Fund for Irish Racecourses, which is being spent over five years, to continue the substantial upgrading of racecourses.  HRI will provide up to €135 million in grant aid and the racecourses will finance the balance from their own resources.To date the Fund has not only helped towards providing some top class racing venues and facilities, but it has also underpinned significant employment in the industries. Horse breeding is a significant net contributor to the Irish economy and has an important role to play in generating employment, particularly in the tourism and agri-economy sectors, making it a significant regional employer and an important contributor to rural communities. The Irish greyhound industry is also regarded as one of the most vibrant and successful in the world.Prior to 2001 the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bodies were funded with annual grant-in-aid allocations as well as a fixed fee from off-course betting and 0.3% of turnover from off-course betting.The rationale of the Fund was that horse and greyhound racing needed certainty in relation to its funding support on a multi-annual basis and that such funding to develop the industries should be derived from the duty generated from off-course betting. When the Fund commenced in 2001, Excise Duty on off-course betting was 5%, which was subsequently reduced by the Minister for Finance to 2% from 1st May 2002. The resulting fall in revenue caused the yield for 2002, 2003 and 2004 to fall below the guaranteed minimum level.  In the Budget 2006, the Minister for Finance further reduced the Excise Duty on off-course betting from 2% to 1% from 1 July 2006 with the intention that the tax is borne by the industry and not the customer.   This has also resulted in revenue below the guaranteed minimum level up to 2008.The shortfall met from direct Exchequer revenue sources was €110.58m during the period 2001-2007 and is likely to be a total of €150.43m up to the end of 2008.  In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from €254m to €550m to continue the Fund for a further four years to 2008.The current round of the Fund is due to expire early in 2009. A review of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is currently underway. Any extension of the Fund will require the approval of the Government and the Oireachtas.Fund Year20012002200320042005200620072008Previous Year excise duty on off-course betting(2000)

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I propose to take Questions Nos. 141, 142, 147, 166 and 172 together.Work on the National Sports Facilities Strategy is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport so that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.A nationwide audit of sports facilities is being carried out in conjunction with the strategy and is being completed in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase one, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  Phase two of the audit, which is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identifying the need for future provision, is underway with the assistance of local authorities.  Guidelines have been issued to local authorities to assist them in carrying out the audit.Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department funding is allocated towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sports and recreational facilities in Ireland.  Through the Sports Capital Programme the Government has allocated over €725 million in over 7,400 separate sports projects since 1998.  The Programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs, to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.  In applying the assessment criteria of the Sports Capital Programme the Department aims to have a good spread of funding between different geographical areas of the country and the allocations reflect this policy.The National Sports Facilities Strategy will address future sports facility funding and provision and will inform future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I propose to take Questions Nos. 144, 165, 277 and 284 together.The Government's priorities for the Arts are set out in the Programme for Government and are elaborated further in my Department's Statement of Strategy and the Arts Plan 2008, which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved primarily to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:to stimulate public interest in the arts;to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;to assist in improving standards in the arts.The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.As Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism I am committed to securing the best possible funding deal for the Arts Council and the arts sector generally throughout the country.  The Arts Council's funding requirement for the year ahead however, can only be addressed in the context of the consideration of the Estimates for the Public Services for 2009.  In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society, in a declining Exchequer revenue environment.Funding for the Arts Council has increased from €47.67 million in 2002 to €81.6 million in 2008 — an increase of over 71%.  These are significant amounts of money in any context.  This funding has transformed the arts, increasing access to and participation in the arts, and has provided an excellent platform for future development.My policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.The following table shows the funding provided to the Arts Council between 1997 and 2008.YearFunding

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I have received the representations referred to by the Deputy.  The tax relief on donations to certain sports bodies scheme, established under section 847a of the Taxes Consolidation Act came into effect from 1st May 2002. It allows for tax relief on donations made to approved sports bodies for the funding of sports capital projects.This scheme applies to donations of over €250 made toward expenses incurred by an approved sports body in relation to a capital project after the 1st of May 2002.  The donation must be freely given with no benefit derived in return by the donor.If the donor is a PAYE taxpayer the sports body claims the tax relief at the donor's marginal rate, e.g. an individual on the higher rate of tax (41%) makes a donation of €590 to a sports body. The sports body will then be able to claim €410 from Revenue at the end of the tax year i.e. the amount of tax already paid to Revenue by the donor on the net amount of €590.Individual taxpayers on the self-assessment system will be able to claim relief on their annual tax returns as a deduction from their total income. A corporate entity may claim relief on a donation by treating it as a deductible trading expense.Projects that are valid under the scheme include the following:the purchase, construction or refurbishment of a building or structure, or part of a building or structure to be used for sporting or recreation activities provided by the approved sports body,the purchase of land to be used by the approved sports body in the provision of sporting or recreation facilities,the purchase of permanently based equipment (excluding personal equipment) for use by the approved sports body in the provision of sporting or recreation facilities,the improvement of the playing pitches, surfaces or facilities of the approved sports body, andthe repayment of, or the payment of interest on, money borrowed by the approved sports body on or after 1 May 2002 for any of the above purposes.I believe that the scheme is working well with 217 projects worth over €156 million approved to date.Any changes to this scheme would be a matter for the Minister for Finance to consider in the context of overall taxation policy.

One of these was for sporting bodies. I understand the Minister will be in contact shortly in this regard with a number of these bodies to assist them to reach out  to newcomers and get them involved in sport as part of their overall integration into Irish society.I am very conscious of the importance of this objective and the Department will make every effort to contribute in a co-ordinated way to the promotion of integration in  delivering the range of services within its remit.

This programme which is being overseen by the Office of Public Works comprises nine separate phases and includes the upgrading of the security and sprinkler systems in various buildings, the refurbishment of the former NCAD building and the redevelopment of No. 4 Kildare Street as the Library's administrative offices which have been completed.The provision of a purpose built extension and major storage facility for the National Library is among the cultural infrastructure projects included in the National Development Plan 2007-2013. Planning permission has been obtained for the building and my Department is working closely with the National Library and the Office of Public Works to ensure that this vitally important project is progressed as soon as possible. The proposed facility will address the Library's accommodation needs and will also provide a vital link between all of the Library's premises on Kildare Street thus improving efficiency and enhancing service delivery.

The Council is also in the process of developing a CD Rom/Web resource for Governing Bodies to share best practice in key areas such as governance, volunteers, membership development etc. Case studies of best practice by NGBs will feature in each area.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	636	Garda vetting is an important component of good recruitment practice.  Good recruitment practice, in turn, forms one element of an organisation's overall Child Protection Policy.  Arts & Sports organisations come within the remit of the existing Garda vetting process managed by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  There is, therefore, no separate arrangement for access to vetting by Arts and Sports organisations.The Arts Council's approach to this matter is informed by its Children First guidelines.  However, the procedure which requires organisations to have a through-put of in excess of 200 job applications per year effectively excludes most arts organisations funded by the Arts Council from direct access to the vetting process.  The Arts Council has been working with the Garda Central Vetting Unit to try and address this issue.  To date three arts organisations are registered as ‘authorised signatory' with the Garda Central Vetting Unit (Create, the National Association for Youth Drama and more recently, Poetry Ireland).  These organisations facilitate their own sectors/membership (community arts in the case of Create; youth theatres in the case of NAYD; writers in the case of Poetry Ireland).  The Arts Council has an interim arrangement with the National Youth Council of Ireland for vetting the Council's own designated staff [currently the Council's Young People Children and Education (YPCE) Team, Advisers and HR personnel]. This is an interim measure and, for obvious reasons, NYCI can only offer this facility to the YPCE staff, not the entire organisation and certainly not to the arts sector at large.  Comprehensive access to vetting by arts organisations is a matter currently under consideration.In addition, in 2007 my Department wrote to all of the National Cultural Institutions under its aegis to reinforce the necessity for appropriate recruitment policies and vetting checks where contact with young people was concerned.The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, has a statutory role in the promotion and development of sport. In that context the ISC provides funding and support to National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of sport.The Irish Sports Council and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland (now Sport NI) published a joint Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport in 2000. A review of the Code was carried out in 2005 and the Code updated. The Code ensures that the policies and procedures that are implemented at all levels in sport are up-to-date and in line with relevant documents, current best practice and legislation throughout the island of Ireland.The Code has been adopted and implemented by NGBs, local sports partnerships and community/voluntary groups on an on-going basis since 2000. Compliance with the Code of Ethics is one of the criteria for ISC NGB eligibility.With specific reference to Garda vetting the ISC is represented on the Implementation Group on Garda Vetting and, with the approval of the Group, is rolling out Garda vetting on a phased basis to its NGBs, At present, 25 NGBs are registered with the Garda Central Vetting Unit and are in receipt of vetting. Another 10 NGBs have registered but are still awaiting training and 27 NGBs have yet to commence the registration process.The Irish Sports Council notifies the Garda Central Vetting Unit when an NGB is in a position to apply for registration with the unit and of the person nominated in the organisation to manage the process.   The Garda Central Vetting Unit then liaises with the nominated person in the NGB and the registration process is commenced.  On registration, Authorised Signatories are trained in the NGB concerned and the Garda Vetting service is then extended to that Organisation.Each NGB is responsible for how they roll-out the vetting process within their organisation.

In 2004 the Government allocated a sum of €191m towards the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road into a 50,000 capacity stadium. The construction of the stadium is well underway and on target for completion in Spring, 2010 and will be well equipped to meet the highest of standards needed to showcase such an important event as the UEFA cup Final.My predecessor met with the President of UEFA last year and indicated his support for the staging of the game at Lansdowne Road.  My Department also participated with Dublin City Council and the FAI in a presentation to UEFA officials about the merits of Lansdowne Road Stadium hosting the final.  I look forward to a successful outcome of the bidding process.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 163 together.The Department of Arts Sport and Tourism was designated for relocation to Killarney, Co. Kerry, under the Government's Decentralisation Programme, which was announced in the 2004 Budget.  The Department, which has a staff of 130, excluding the National Archives, was designated an "early mover" by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG). To date, 76 staff have relocated to temporary accommodation in Fossa, Killarney, 34 of whom were previously located in Dublin with the remainder joining the Department from provincial locations. The objective is to complete the decentralisation process of the Department by early 2009 by which time it will be operating from the new purpose built offices in Killarney.The OPW are responsible for costs relating to both the temporary and the permanent accommodation and therefore these do not fall within my Department's Vote.  The non-property costs to date amount to approximately €880,000.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	639	The Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS) is a key element in the Government's regional arts strategy and has greatly improved access to and participation in the arts for large numbers of people nationwide.  The scheme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces.Facilities funded to date include integrated arts centres, theatres, galleries, studio, and creative and performance spaces.  In this manner my Department provides the bulk of capital funding for building and refurbishing arts facilities around the country, mainly in the not for profit sector, while the Arts Council provides the ongoing revenue support for many of the facilities.While there is no specific obligation on arts groups who have received funding under the ACCESS scheme to offer the use of these venues to the wider community and in particular to the local youth community, the criteria in the ACCESS guidelines refers specifically to the extent to which the facility will:improve and extend access to, or participation in, the arts within the catchment area of the relevant facility:implement works that will ensure the continued availability of the relevant facility into the future:To obtain funding under the objectives of the ACCESS scheme applicants for grant aid are required to indicate how their proposed grant aided facility will encourage as wide a range of participation as possible from the local community in all art forms.  This would include all age groups. The independent Selection Committee has regard to this and other criteria when making recommendations to the Minister.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	640	In 2006 the Government decided to proceed with the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre by way of a public private partnership on a site at George's Dock, on a build, finance and maintain basis. This site was chosen following an extensive search exercise conducted by the Office of Public Works.The project is complex and there are a myriad of technical, procedural and legal factors to address in making progress on it and these are being progressed. It remains a priority for the Department and Government in the Programme for Government and the National Development Plan.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 167 together.A range of measures are being put in place in order to achieve the reduction of 3% in payroll costs for the Department.  The existing prioritisation of staff resources in line with the business needs of the Department is being examined and, in this context, the need to fill each vacancy that arises in the normal course or from the transfer of staff from the Department under the Government's Decentralisation programme will be reviewed. In addition it is proposed to reduce the current level of overtime.  It is not possible to give a detailed breakdown of the savings that will arise but they are expected to be of the order of €400,000 in 2009.In the case of my private and constituency offices, the staffing level is at a total of 10, 5 serving in my Private Office and 5 in my Constituency office. This is well within the permitted limits set out in the Department of Finance Guidelines on the staffing of Ministerial Offices. While I consider the present number to be a minimum requirement in the context of the business needs and the satisfactory functioning of the offices, I will keep the matter under review.The Minister of State, Mr. Martin Mansergh, T.D. does not have private or constituency office facilities at this Department.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	642	Funding of €30 million has been earmarked under the Culture Sub Programme of the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 for off site storage for the National Cultural Institutions, including the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  The individual off-site storage needs of the National Cultural Institutions, are being dealt with progressively on an individual basis.  The OPW are aware of the importance of storage matters for the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the OPW have been working on both IMMA's on-site and off-site storage facilities.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The Government has decided to redevelop the National Concert Hall.  The primary objective of the project is to provide three performance auditoria in a single complex, offering capacity for about 2,050 seats in a newly built Main Hall; the existing hall of just over a 1,000 seats as a mid size performance space; and a smaller more flexible hall of 400 seats, respectively and the related public and management spaces associated with a concert hall complex developed to the highest international acoustic and architectural standards.  This three-hall configuration will enable the National Concert Hall to provide for public demand including the staging of key performances by top-class world artists at reasonable ticket prices, and will meet the requirement for universal access.  It is envisaged that the Earlsfort Terrace buildings will be re-united with the Iveagh Gardens, facilitating increased public access, and new public rooms, cafes and restaurants would over-look the Gardens and the city.Work is advancing well on the project.  The redeveloped National Concert Hall will be procured through a Design / Build / Finance / Maintain PPP contract.  In accordance with those procedures the Official notification of the tender was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 29th May 2008 with a closing date of the 7th of July.  In early September three applicant consortia were shortlisted and invited to participate in the competitive dialogue process.  This dialogue commenced on the 23rd of September 2008.It is intended to close the dialogue process and invite the participants to submit tenders by end June 2009.  The successful tenderer should be selected by Autumn 2009.Within the Cultural sub-programme of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, provision has been made for the National Concert Hall redevelopment project.  The tenders received will determine the cost of the project.I look forward to this project progressing speedily through the PPP process so that Dublin will have a Concert Hall which will be on a par with leading concert halls in capital cities throughout Europe, and which will enable the current and expanding market demand for musical entertainment to be met.

In January 2008, the Department met with representatives of the commercial sponsors and in April 2008, my predecessor, the late Séamus Brennan TD, along with officials of the Department, met again with the commercial sponsors and others where the modalities for a possible Irish bid for the WEG 2014 were discussed.More recently, in August, I met with a representative of the 2010 WEG commercial sponsors, while in September 2008 I, along with the Secretary General of the Department and the Chairman of Fáilte Ireland, met with representatives of the commercial sponsors and organisers of WEG 2010.Before determining any possible Government involvement — through Fáilte Ireland's International Sports Tourism Initiative or otherwise — in a bid for the 2014 Games, it would be necessary to have a full assessment of the total costs involved and the potential benefits in terms of visitor numbers and international media coverage arising from the event.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	645	A sum of €184m has been provided in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 to support existing projects in the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme and for new projects to be selected following the launch of a new round of the Programme.  However, given the current budgetary constraints, it is not intended to launch a new round of the Programme at this time.A total of 57 applications were received under the current round of the Programme.  Of these 37 projects have been completed and opened to the public, 8 other pools, which have been allocated funding, are under construction and another 12 are at various stages of development and will be allocated funding by my Department in due course.The current round of the Programme has made noteworthy progress over the last 8 years when consideration is given to the lead in time in the development of pool projects.  Our priority now is to work with the relevant local authorities in bringing into public use the remaining 20 pools which are included in the current round.A Value for Money and Policy Review Report of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme was carried out by the Department to examine, among other things, how the Programme has worked to date, and what changes, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The Report has now been published and the recommendations will be considered in the context of future rounds of the Programme.

Even before the Agreement however, there was significant co-operation in tourism.  Joint marketing started in the mid 1990s through the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative (OTMI).Most recently, on the 29th May I met with the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, Nigel Dodds MP, MLA at a North South Ministerial Council Meeting in Tourism Sectoral format.  The meeting was held in Enniskillen and was also attended by Michelle Gildernew, MP, MLA, the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	647	There are a large number of statutory and other agencies under the remit of the Department providing a wide range of functions.  I am currently examining the scope for efficiencies through the rationalisation of those agencies, whether through the development of synergies or through amalgamations.  Any final decisions in this regard will be announced in due course.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	648	The recommendations contained in the report of the Arts and Education Committee charts a possible way forward for the development of an arts in education practice. They highlight the benefits of systematic collaboration between schools and local artists and through visits by schools to arts events and performances — so as to normalise and mainstream arts experience in the minds and lives of our future generations.My colleague the Minister for Education and Science and I are committed to moving to implement the key recommendations of this Report. We must be realistic and practical, however, in pursuing these comprehensive and relatively costly proposals.Decisions on their implementation will fall to be considered in the light of available resources to my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	649	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a Museum of Irish Literature in Parnell Square.  A Steering Committee chaired by the Department has been established.  It has been agreed to conduct a Scoping Study into the project and the Committee is finalising the Terms of Reference for that Study.Funding for this project is not provided specifically in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  The issue of funding for this project, including funding from external sources, will be reviewed as the proposals develop having regard to the resources available.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	650	As the Deputy will be aware, decisions regarding the status of Cork and Shannon Airports are matters for my colleague the Minister for Transport although my Department obviously monitors developments in this regard.I understand that the Minister for Transport has recently received the Cork and Shannon business plans and expects to receive a finalised commentary on those plans by the DAA shortly when they submit their own plan under the Act.  The DAA's commentary is expected to address recent trends in the aviation market, the challenges facing the State airports and the financial and operational aspects of restructuring.Obviously good and competitive access is critical for the continued success of Irish tourism and a well managed and efficient airport system is crucial in this regard. The Department and I will continue to closely monitor developments with regard to Cork and Shannon airports and liaise as appropriate with the Department of Transport.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	651	Under sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations and, in certain circumstances to schools and colleges, throughout the country.  It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Under the programme priority is given to the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities.Primary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the programme may apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school itself.  Any sports facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation and which would be located within school grounds would have to meet these same conditions.Applications from primary and post-primary schools and colleges on their own are not considered under the programme.Work on the development of a National Sports Facility Strategy is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment at national, regional and local level.  An inter-agency steering group is overseeing this work and includes representation from the Department of Education and Science.  The work of this group has included discussions with the Department of Education and Science on how its policy on the provision of sports hall facilities and my Department's policy for the provision of sports facilities might be complementary.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	652	As I have previously indicated to the House, my Department has been working on a Bill to enable the Irish Sports Council to establish subsidiaries.  Issues have arisen during the drafting of the Bill that are the subject of discussion between my Department, the Department of Finance, the Irish Sports Council and the Attorney General's Office.  I have said previously that I am not convinced, particularly in light of the recent OECD Report, of the need to establish new bodies on a statutory basis.  When the issues arising from the proposed legislation are clarified I will decide on how best to proceed.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	653	There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to "create a new combined Cultural Visa and Work Permit that simplifies and speeds up entry by incoming artists and groups to Ireland". Discussions regarding the practical implementation of this commitment are ongoing with the other relevant Departments — Department of Justice, Equality & Law Reform and Department of Enterprise, Trade & Employment — and further progress is expected over the coming months.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	654	The information requested by the deputy is not available. There is no indicator on death certificates to specify that the deceased was homeless, hence mortality statistics relating to homeless people cannot be produced by the Central Statistics Office.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The CSO invited submissions on the questionnaire content of the 2011 Census of Population in a public consultation initiated on 14th August 2008. The office received over 80 submissions from individuals and organisations in response to this consultation. A number of these related to the enumeration of homeless persons.A Census Advisory Group consisting of representatives of Government departments, local authorities, public bodies, the social partners, universities and research institutes was set up and met on 25th September 2008 to consider the various submissions. The group decided that the best way to progress issues relating to the enumeration of the homeless was for CSO to convene a specialist sub-group with expertise in this area. Such a group has been set up and an initial meeting has been arranged for Tuesday 14th October in CSO. The group has representatives of the homeless agencies, central government and local authorities along with CSO.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	656	I am unable to attend the ceremony to mark the United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has primary responsibility for such matters will mark the day with an address to the Biennial Conference of the Irish Forum for Global Health in Cork on the same date.The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger is the central objective of Ireland's overseas development programme and the UN International Day is an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the scale of the challenge and to renew our commitments.  It is appropriate that it falls so shortly after the high level event on the Millennium Development Goals at the UN in New York last month, at which leaders from national governments, civil society and the private sector re-committed themselves to these important objectives.The presence of myself, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for Overseas Development in New York on that occasion, is a clear indication of our desire to play an important role in global efforts to combat poverty.

It was transferred because the Social Economy Programme was better suited to the mandate of the Department of Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs.I have no plans to transfer the Community Employment Programme to another Department.  However, contacts do take place from time to time with other Departments as to particular projects.

The Unit operates a telephone helpline which can be contacted at 01 8045200 and Lo Call: 1890 220 226. The CRO also has a dedicated e-mail address, info@cro.ie., to assist the public.In addition, the CRO has a public office where callers can get information on their filing obligations. The address of the Public Office is Parnell House, 14 Parnell Square, Dublin 1.

At present, and provided all required information is in order, such applications are processed within 24 hours of receipt.Over 90% of applications are received using this scheme. The target for processing paper-based applications is 15 working days provided all documentation is in order.  At present, such applications are processed within 48 hours of receipt.The registration of forms conveying changes in director details takes approximately 2 weeks at present. Processing times vary in accordance with the volume of submissions received.Applications for a change of company name are generally processed within 7 working days provided all relevant information is submitted.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	661	The total income of the National Training Fund in 2007 was €433.3 million. For 2008 the income is estimated to be €440.6 million.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I understand from FÁS that funds administered by Training Centres are accounted for under the heading Direct costs and are controlled by the local Training Centre.Direct costs are costs directly associated with the running of individual training courses in each Training Centre and all costs can be attributed to the individual training course.A large proportion of the costs of training for each course are paid out in respect of allowances to the trainees. This is administered through a trainee and payroll system. This is a computerised system that pays trainees directly into their bank account via electronic fund transfer.When a trainee is registering with FÁS they must provide an approved F103 form from Social Welfare which indicates the allowance they are entitled to. In addition to the F103, FÁS seeks the trainee bank account details to ensure payment is made via electronic fund transfer. Full supporting documentation is on file and held in the local Training Centre to support any allowances paid.Other costs, for example materials, are purchased locally by each Training Centre in line with FÁS procurement procedures and documentation is kept on file to support these transactions.All payments made by Training Centres are periodically audited by the FÁS Internal Audit department. The Training Centres may also be audited by the Controller and Auditor General as required and also by European Union auditors.The FÁS Finance & Administration units in each FÁS Region also monitor and review payments issued by Training Centres.All staff costs are controlled and paid centrally from FÁS Head Office.A detailed budget for each Training Centre is allocated at the beginning of each year.Monthly management accounts for each Training Centre are produced showing budget performance and budget variances.These Training Centre management accounts are consolidated into both regional and national accounts that are reviewed monthly by FÁS management.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I understand that FÁS has developed a procurement manual that is in accordance with the EU Procurement Directives and the Irish Government Contract Regulations.  The manual was approved by the Board of FÁS in April 2005. It is the policy of FÁS to tender for goods and services in accordance with current financial authority levels as set out in these procurement procedures. The calculation of the estimated value of the goods or services is based on the amount payable by FÁS.For goods/services with an estimated value below €50,000 a restricted procedure is used and up to five qualified suppliers are invited to quote/tender. Where the value is greater than €50,000, it is the policy of FÁS to publish an expression of interest on the government E-Tenders website. Where the goods are over current EU thresholds the competition is automatically advertised on the Official Journal of the European Community website through the E-Tenders website.   The duration of the order depends upon the nature of the goods/service provided. Duration can range from weeks/months (once off deliveries) to four years (Supply contracts such as catering/cleaning contracts).

This figure represents the current liability for future superannuation payments to serving public service employees and their dependents in respect of service to date along with the liability for all future payments to current pensioners and their dependents. In the past estimates of the accrued liability were not made on a regular basis. However, the Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions (2000) provided an estimate of €25bn for the value of accrued liabilities as of 1997.   The National Pension Reserve Fund was set up in April 2001 and the value of funds in the NPRF as at end 2007 was €21bn
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information furnished on tax returns does not generally require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of economic activity to be identified. Consequently, the precise figures of net yield of tax revenues from the construction industry cannot be readily identified.Information in relation to VAT, Income Tax and Corporation Tax can, however, be provided as to the estimated gross amounts of taxes paid (i.e. before allowing for repayments) by taxpayers in the construction industry. In considering this data, it is important to bear in mind the specific assumptions that have been made and are set out in the notes below.The gross yield of VAT (not including VAT on imports), PAYE/PRSI, Income tax non-PAYE and Corporation tax from taxpayers in the construction industry within the tax head is estimated as follows for 2004:Tax head2004€ millionVAT2,041PAYE/PRSI1,878Income Tax non-PAYE244Corporation Tax404Please see accompanying Notes. Data for previous years are not readily available.I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that data for earlier years are not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of Revenue records.Notes: These figures are gross receipts as provided by the Revenue Commissioners and differ slightly from the Exchequer receipts due to timing and accounting issues. "Income Tax (non-PAYE)" includes direct Income Tax and PRSI payments received from self-assessed taxpayers and the estimated Relevant Contracts Tax not offset to other taxes, attributable to the construction industry but excludes certain "deduction" taxes such as Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Withholding Tax on professional fees, Dividend Withholding Tax as well as yields from audit and other back duty settlements. The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit "NACE code (Rev. 1)" which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided.  The figure provided for the estimated gross yield from the construction industry has been expanded to include the yield from activities and businesses which are related, either in whole or in part, to the construction sector. An example of these would be architecture, engineering and the manufacture of products used in construction, but not real estate activities.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	675	Given that the Deputy has asked for data going back to 2000 i.e. before the recent enlargements of the EU, the data published by Eurostat for the EU 15 over the period in question is used in order to provide a comparable set of data. It should be noted that the data for the contribution of construction to output is published by Eurostat on a Gross Value Added (GVA) basis and not as a proportion of GDP. Also, figures for 2008 have not yet been published.

There has to be a permanent cessation of the trade for such loss relief to apply.I should add that loss relief is not available in respect of a write-down in the value of property assets held as investments.  Where property is held for investment purposes, losses are only allowed on disposals of assets and such losses may only be offset against current or future capital gains.I am advised by Revenue that separate figures are not available on the amount of tax refunds paid to property developers on foot of refund claims made by them in respect of property re-valuations in 2006, 2007 and 2008.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are not aware of significant refunds being claimed to date in this respect and there is no evidence so far to show that the issue has impacted in any material way on the overall tax yield.  However, the position is being kept under review.

The Deputy may wish to note that over the two year period of the guarantee the covered institutions will pay a significant charge for the guarantee.I am informed by the NTMA that there are no apparent immediate effects on the cost of short term borrowing.  In relation to the cost of long term borrowing this is a function of a range of factors including short term volatility in the markets, the underlying trend in spreads, the weakening budget position.  It is difficult at this time to give any estimation of the impact of the introduction of the guarantee scheme over the longer term.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	682	I would point out to the Deputy that this Government has provided significant supports to first-time buyers through the mortgage interest relief measure fulfilling the commitment contained in the programme for Government.  Cumulatively, as a result of Budget 2007 and Budget 2008, first-time buyers have obtained additional relief of up to €100 per month, if single, or €200 per month, if married or widowed, subject to paying sufficient mortgage interest to avail of the relief.In addition to the increase in mortgage interest relief, the limit of the exemption from income tax which applies to rent received when a person rents out a room or rooms in his or her principal private residence was increased from €7,620 to €10,000 in Budget 2008.These are substantial measures and I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of all mortgage interest relief in 2008 is expected to be approximately €665 million.The question of any change in the rate of mortgage interest relief would be a matter to be considered in the context of future Budgets.  However as it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.  I do not propose to depart from that practice.Furthermore, last week against the backdrop of unprecedented difficulties in international financial markets, the Government acted quickly and resolutely to guarantee the depositors and lenders with Irish financial institutions and ensure these institutions can access the funding necessary to enable them to continue to provide the financial services and liquidity needed for the proper functioning of our economy and society.The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, provides the necessary legal underpinning to the Government's announcement and I will shortly bring before the Houses of the Oireachtas the scheme provided for in the Act, which will set out in greater detail the terms and conditions on which assistance will be provided.In taking its decisive move, the Government has done its part to create the conditions that will enable credit institutions to access funding so that they are in a position to fulfil their role in providing credit in our economy and society. It is now up to these institutions to respond to the Government's action by ensuring the flow of finance is channelled to sustain economic activity.Finally, as the Deputy is aware, the decision as to the range and scope of the particular products to be provided by financial institutions is ultimately a commercial one for those organisations and one in which neither I nor the Financial Regulator has an operational role.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	683	The function of the Minister is to provide an appropriate and robust legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector with a particular focus on the consumer.The Financial Regulator has a wide regulatory remit in respect of financial matters, including banking supervision, which relates to the prudential supervision of mortgage providers i.e. banks and building societies.  The objectives of supervising financial institutions are to foster a stable banking system and to provide a degree of protection to depositors with individual credit institutions.As part of its banking supervision role, the Financial Regulator supervises the financial institutions on an ongoing basis and develops supervisory guidance and requirements for their operation.  It also involves prudential supervision which includes monitoring the business of banks and building societies and how it is planned, managed, and controlled and checking compliance with statutory and non-statutory requirements.In recent times various initiatives have been introduced by the Financial Regulator for the financial services sector, including the mortgage sector, to encourage responsible lending and lending of products that are appropriate to a consumer's particular circumstances.At present, there are a number of regulations that financial institutions must have regard to when engaging in mortgage provision activities.  Firstly, the Financial Regulator and the Irish Banking Federation have agreed guidelines on a stress testing requirement applying at the level of individual loan applications under which the lender must stress test the borrower's ability to repay the loan in the event that the interest rate applied were to increase to ECB + 2.75%.Secondly, the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code contains "Know the Consumer" and "Suitability" requirements, which must be followed by both lenders and intermediaries at point of sale.  The mortgage provider must demonstrate that it has gathered sufficient information from the consumer to allow it to provide a recommendation to that consumer.  The mortgage recommended must be suitable to the consumer having regard to the facts disclosed by the consumer.  A written statement setting out the reasons why a mortgage product/selection of mortgage products offered to the consumer are suitable must be given to the consumer.  Mortgage intermediaries must submit to a mortgage lender a signed declaration that it has had sight of all original supporting documentation including banks statements, P60/certificate of earnings and other supporting documentation evidencing the consumer's identity and ability to repay.In addition, when a consumer falls into arrears, the Code requires that regulated entities must inform the consumer in writing of the arrears, the date the account fell into arrears, the number of and total payments missed, the amount of arrears interest charged to date and the interest rate applicable to the arrears.  Supporting the specific provisions of the Code is the overarching principle that regulated entities must "act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market."In mid 2007 the Financial Regulator carried out survey of the sales process of mortgage providers to examine how firms were planning to comply with Code provisions relating to mortgage suitability and to issue feedback to regulated mortgage lenders on key issues.Overall, the findings showed that those institutions surveyed were well advanced in planning and implementing amendments to their systems and processes, in order to comply with the Code provisions relating to mortgage suitability.In its feedback to mortgage providers, the Financial Regulator advised, inter alia, that whilst affordability is a prime component of suitability, there are other factors directly related to the consumer's individual situation that should be taken into account in order to fully assess the suitability of a mortgage sale e.g. purpose of borrowings, age of consumer, attitude to fixed/variable interest, type and length of loan.The Financial Regulator will also continue to monitor compliance with the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 which imposes various obligations on mortgage lenders and mortgage intermediaries, including, calculation of APR, warning on loss of home if repayments are not kept up to appear on mortgage applications, and provisions covering the advertising of housing loans.In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that the EU Commission December 2007 White Paper on the Integration of EU Mortgage Credit Markets, COM(2007)807, summarises the conclusions of a comprehensive review of the functioning and the level of integration of EU mortgage credit markets.  It presents a package of measures to improve the efficiency and the competitiveness of EU residential mortgage markets.  My Department is working with the Commission on this initiative which involves amongst other things examining various aspects of the mortgage credit market here in Ireland on an ongoing basis.Last week against the backdrop of unprecedented difficulties in international financial markets, the Government acted quickly and resolutely to guarantee the depositors and lenders with Irish financial institutions and ensure these institutions can access the funding necessary to enable them to continue to provide the financial services and liquidity needed for the proper functioning of our economy and society.  The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, provides the necessary legal underpinning to the Government's announcement and I will shortly bring before the Houses of the Oireachtas the scheme provided for in the Act, which will set out in greater detail the terms and conditions on which assistance will be provided.  In taking its decisive move, the Government has done its part to create the conditions that will enable credit institutions to access funding so that they are in a position to fulfil their role in providing credit in our economy and society.  It is now up to these institutions to respond to the Government's action by ensuring the flow of finance is channelled to sustain economic activity.Accordingly, I do not see the need at this time to initiate a full review of the operation of the mortgage sector in Ireland.

Under the Local Government Act, 1998 motor taxation is paid directly into the Local Government Fund.  The Fund is used generally to finance local authority general purposes needs and non-national road grants.

This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.I would point out that it is normal for state funded services, such as schools and hospitals, to bear VAT on their purchases.  However, Exchequer funding for such services, including primary and secondary schools, takes account of VAT when allocations are being made by the Government.  I, therefore, have no plans to introduce a mechanism to relieve VAT incurred by schools on the purchase of computers.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	689	The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.

I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static units in Cork and Galway last December.  The programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months.The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in the National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.  The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focused at present on the completion of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.The Deputy's specific questions in relation to the take up of BreastCheck appointments and the numbers screened in each region are the responsibility of the National Cancer Screening Service.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Chief Executive Officer of the Service to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the matters raised.

The Board, in cooperation with its European counterparts, keeps the status and other safety issues of all medicinal products under review and any issues arising are examined and appropriate regulatory action taken if required.National and EU law require medicinal products to be labelled with a statement on medicinal products to "Keep out of reach of children".  The only specific legislation relating to child-resistant proof containers is in the Medicinal Products (Control of Paracetamol) Regulations 2001 which specify use of blister packs in certain circumstances.  The regulatory authorities in Europe are generally assessing products on the basis of specific need and as such the needs of elderly and those with mobility-related illness also need to be part of the assessment.I also understand that the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland published guidelines for Dispensing Prescriptions in June 1997 which encourage pharmacists to use where possible child-resistant containers.

This document represents the expert opinion of the sub-committee, following a review of the scientific literature and an extensive consultation exercise.  In this document it explains that MRSA stands for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus.Staphylococcus Aureus is a bacterium that is found in about one third of individuals, mainly in the nose but can also reside on the skin.  It is generally not a problem except when it gains entry to deep tissues, bloodstream and the lungs.  This can lead to surgical site or wound infection, bloodstream infection or bacteraemia.Early penicillin antibiotics were effective in the treatment of such infections.  However, many strains have become resistant and as methicillin was amongst the first anti-staphylococcal agents used, these strains have subsequently been known as MRSA.  This resistant form is much less common in the general community and would be probably around 1-2% in the general population.  However, in certain groups, the elderly or people who have recently been in hospital or are receiving antibiotics, this will be higher.

Under the Act, the maximum amount for basic subvention is €300 per week.  The Act also provides for enhanced subvention to be paid. However, there is no maximum amount set for enhanced subvention.  The amount paid is at the discretion of the HSE and will vary depending on the following criteria:the assessed means of the applicant,the cost of care in the individual case compared to the level of fees in the locality,the amount of basic subvention payable,the amount of resources available for the scheme,the need for the HSE to ensure that the available resources are distributed in a way that supports applicants as evenly as  possible across the country.In order to qualify for a subvention, an individual must be:(a) sufficiently dependent to require maintenance in a nursing home, and(b) unable to pay any or part of the cost of maintenance in the home. In order to determine this, they must undergo a means assessment which takes account of their income and assets.At present, there are approximately 8,500 people in receipt of subvention.  A further 3,000 are in contracted beds in private nursing homes. People in contract beds pay public nursing home charges and the State pays the balance of the cost.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to provide the breakdown requested, on a county basis.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

My Department recently invited applications from road authorities for funding under the regional and local roads Specific Improvements Grant scheme in 2009.  The proposals submitted by Kerry County Council included an application for further grant aid for that project.All applications received for funding under the scheme will be considered by my Department, having regard to compliance with eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme in 2009.  The 2009 regional and local road grant allocations to local authorities will be announced early next year.

As part of the airport restructuring process the boards of Cork and Shannon airport are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.All three airport business plans have to be coordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority for eventual approval by the Minister for Finance and myself. Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three state airports.I have already received the Cork and Shannon business plans but I expect shortly to receive a finalised commentary on those plans by the DAA when they submit their own plan under the Act. I would expect DAA's commentary to address recent trends in the aviation market, the challenges facing the State airports and the financial and operational aspects of restructuring.Reply to PQ No. 31: I would like to put on record my appreciation of the work of Joe Gantly as Chairman of the Cork Airport Authority until his resignation in August. I hope to make an announcement on it in the near future.

The High Court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the legislation was delivered in early 2006 but it has since been appealed to the Supreme Court.  While operation of the law in relation to ground rents continues to be reviewed in my Department, there are no proposals for changes pending the outcome of the appeal that I have mentioned.It should be noted that the law already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple in dwelling houses which is set out in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978.  Part III of that Act makes provision for a streamlined procedure, operated by the Property Registration Authority, whereby a person may acquire the fee simple in their dwelling house.

The position is that 3 counties were designated compulsory registration areas in 1970 (Carlow, Laois and Meath) and 3 more in 2006 (Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath). On 1 October 2008, six further counties — Clare, Kilkenny, Louth, Sligo, Wexford and Wicklow — became compulsory registration areas.  This means that nine counties have become compulsory registration areas since publication of the 2004 Report.The Property Registration Authority has been established under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006. One of the principal functions of the Authority is to promote and extend the registration of ownership of land.  The Authority's Strategy Statement 2008 — 2010 sets out a number of strategies designed to advance the completion of the Irish Land Register including the introduction of compulsory certification of title by solicitors and the extension of compulsory first registration on a phased county-by-county basis in line with the roll out of digital mapping.My Department is in consultation with the Law Society, the Property Registration Authority and others on the development of a scheme for implementation of a system of compulsory registration in all the remaining counties.The Government Legislation Programme published on 23 September 2008 provides for publication of the Property Services (Regulation) Bill during the current Dáil session. The Bill will establish the Property Services Regulatory Authority on a statutory basis. The primary task of the new Authority will be to maintain and improve standards in the provision of property services by auctioneers, estate agents and property management agents through a new licensing regime and a system for investigating and adjudicating on complaints against property service providers.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	715	As the Deputy will appreciate, the President of the High Court is responsible for the allocation of business among its judges.  On application to the President, major infrastructural cases may be accorded priority.  Between the institution of proceedings and the fixing of a hearing date, case management is applied to ensure that matters are put in order for hearing as quickly as possible.I understand that, where possible, the President, subject to other judicial commitments, allocates a judge with particular expertise and experience in infrastructural and environmental planning matters to deal with such cases.In addition, since 2004 significant steps have been taken to facilitate the work of the High Court, including the hearing of legal challenges in infrastructure and environmental planning cases.  In 2004, the Government appointed 3 additional judges to the High Court following the enactment of the Civil Liability and Courts Act, 2004 and a further 4 were appointed in May 2007 following the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Act, 2007.Pending the completion of the new 22 room Criminal Court Complex due in early 2010, there is a shortage of court rooms available to the High Court in Dublin.  In order to tackle waiting times in the interim, the President of the High Court has directed that High Court judges (who normally only sit outside Dublin for a limited number of cases and appeals) are to sit in a number of refurbished and enlarged Circuit Court venues throughout the State to deal with judicial review and non-jury cases.  As a result, courtrooms have been freed up in Dublin, which has had a significant impact on waiting times.  For example, cases of less than two days duration now have a waiting time of less than one year with cases of one day's expected duration having a waiting time of three weeks.  Further reductions are expected.I should also point out that it is open to a party to proceedings involving infrastructure to apply for their admission to the Commercial List of the High Court where the proceedings meet the criteria for admission.  The introduction of this list in 2004 has greatly reduced the time in which cases on the list are disposed of.  I understand that 50% of cases are concluded in less than 14 weeks, 75% are concluded in less than 25 weeks and 90% in less than 45 weeks.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	719	I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 to 258, inclusive, together.The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.  Direct provision allows asylum seekers to be provided with full board accommodation and certain ancillary services while their applications for asylum are being processed. Today, there are 62 accommodation centres around the country accommodating just over 6,900 persons.Given the general thrust of the questions being asked here, I need to make two points clear.  Firstly, no asylum seeker is denied access to direct provision, because of mental ill health issues or otherwise.  Secondly, RIA does not expel — nor has it ever expelled — any person from direct provision due to their mental health.All asylum seekers can access direct provision from the date of their application for asylum.  It needs to be understood that there is no obligation placed upon asylum seekers to avail of the accommodation offered by RIA.  Some choose to live with relatives or friends, or make use of their own resources to source accommodation.All asylum seekers are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State which, inter alia, allows them to link with appropriate health supports, including mental health supports.  The State provides access to health services for asylum seekers on the same basis as for Irish citizens.  Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation will generally qualify for a medical card whereby they are eligible to receive a wide range of health services free-of-charge including GP services and prescribed medicines.  Other HSE-provided supports include Public Health Nurse and Community Welfare Supports as well as a dedicated asylum seeker psychological service.  My Department has not carried out any study in relation to the mental health of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation.Asylum seekers presenting to RIA accommodation with special needs are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  Persons with special medical needs can discuss their requirements at medical screening or with other HSE service providers during their time in the State.  Families who have children with special educational needs can link in to supports through the schools.  Where appropriate and feasible, the RIA will make special arrangements at its accommodation centres to address the needs of such clients.Ireland honours its international obligations in allowing asylum seekers entry into the State so that their international protection claims can be assessed in accordance with the law.  In doing so, the State allows to asylum seekers generous access to services, including the direct provision system.  The system delivers a high, consistent standard of service and value for money to the taxpayer, through coordinated service delivery to asylum seekers.  The treatment of asylum seekers in this country is, at a minimum, on a par with the best on offer in this context anywhere in the EU.  No alternative model would deliver the same level and consistency of service to asylum seekers. No other State body is obliged to provide accommodation to asylum seekers, even when — through their own actions — they effectively lead to their own departure from a centre.The rights and obligations of an asylum seeker in a RIA accommodation centre are clearly spelt out in a document  entitled ‘Direct Provision Reception and Accommodation Centre Services, Rules and Procedures', a copy of which is provided upon arrival in the centre. Specific reference is made to the right of RIA to expel a resident in extreme circumstances.  It is a matter for an individual asylum seeker to decide, and made manifest through his own behaviour, whether he wishes to continue to avail of the benefits of the direct provision system.In this respect, while every effort is made by the RIA and other State service providers in each centre to facilitate its smooth running, a very small number of residents have chosen — through their own actions — to exclude themselves from such accommodation.  Expulsion arises as a result of, inter alia, persistent violent and aggressive behaviour, threats to persons and property, assault, violence, vandalism and damage to property.  The RIA has a duty of care towards the 6,900 residents in its care, to centre staff under contract to it, to staff providing services on-site and to visitors, and cannot turn a blind eye to such behaviour.The RIA has had to withdraw accommodation from 22 asylum seekers in the past 18 months. Of these, 14 were at the  ‘Leave to Remain' or Subsidiary Protection phase of the process.  The other eight were either at the primary stages of the asylum process or were involved in a judicial review process.  The mean average length of time spent in direct provision in all of these cases prior to expulsion was 30 months.  Note that at all points in the asylum process, it is open to an applicant to withdraw from the process and seek a voluntary return to his or her country of origin.A decision to expel an asylum seeker from a direct provision centre is usually one of last resort.  That said, asylum seekers who have caused themselves to be expelled from RIA accommodation may make an appeal to RIA clearly stating why they feel that they should be re-accommodated.  It is a matter for the appeals officer to decide whether the person could be safely readmitted to RIA accommodation, taking into account the person's history and the rights to health and safety of other residents in the system, centre staff providing services on-site and to visitors.

The report recommends the establishment of a procedure that will allow for the non-disclosure of certain convictions where certain conditions are met, i.e. the convictions may, in those circumstances, be regarded as ‘spent'.   The conditions include a requirement that a conviction — free period must elapse before a conviction could be regarded as ‘spent'. A period of 7 years without a further conviction is proposed in cases where a sentence of imprisonment had been imposed or 5 years in cases where fines had been imposed. It is important to note that the procedure proposed by the Commission and reflected in the Bill is a non — disclosure procedure: it does not entail a deletion of the conviction from the Garda records.The Bill is currently awaiting Second Stage.  As a result of the Government decision, and subject to certain procedural requirements, it is intended that the Second Stage debate in the Dáil and all subsequent Stages in both Houses should be taken in Government time.

The subject of this investigation was considered at that time to be a senior figure in an organised criminal group, and his suspected activities included armed robbery, the importation and distribution of drugs and firearms, theft of vehicles, tax evasion, etc.This was a joint operation involving personnel from various sections of An Garda Síochána within National Support Services and other National and Divisional Units.  Given the numbers of units involved since 2005, it would not be possible, without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and resources, to attribute precise figures to the numbers of Garda personnel involved.As a result of the operation, twenty eight key members of this organised criminal group were arrested, charged, and brought before the courts, with a number of them receiving lengthy prison sentences. The remainder are awaiting trial for serious offences, including attempted robbery, possession of firearms and the importation and sale / supply of illegal drugs. The operation also resulted in the seizure of substantial quantities of illegal drugs and firearms, cash, and stolen vehicles.Property linked to the target of this operation has also been seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau, while other members of this organised crime group continue to be targeted under ongoing initiatives against those suspected of being involved in organised criminal activity.

The person concerned applied for asylum on 15 June 2005.  She gave birth to a child in this State in June 2005.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 30 August 2006, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her child should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time.The Deputy might wish to note that in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 147 of Thursday 26 June 2008, I inadvertently stated that the person concerned had submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State. On further examination by Officials in my Department of her case file, it was discovered that the person in question had not, in fact, submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  Arising from this error, and in the interests of fairness to the person concerned, she has now been invited to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  In the event that the person concerned decides to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State, this will be fully considered in my Department.  Upon completion of this consideration, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that a possible Subsidiary Protection application is received and refused, or if no such application is received, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	731	Together with its partners in the EU, Ireland is strongly committed to a negotiated and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, with a two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at its core. EU Foreign Ministers regularly discuss the Middle East Peace Process, and the EU, together with the US, Russia and the United Nations, participates in the Quartet, which seeks to advance and underpin the search for peace in the Middle East.Ireland strongly supports the Annapolis process, launched under US auspices in November 2007, aimed at reaching agreement between Israel and the Palestinians by the end of this year.  While few now expect that this deadline will be met, it is understood that some progress has been made in the discussions, which have been led by out-going Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas.  President Abbas briefed me during his recent visit to Dublin, explaining that while considerable work remained to be done, greater clarity and understanding has been achieved between the parties.Following its most recent meeting in New York on 26 September, the Quartet commended the parties for their serious and continuous efforts to reach agreement, and expressed its desire to see the process continue.  I hope that such progress as has been made can be built upon when new administrations are in place in Israel and the US, and that the process will lead to a lasting and just settlement.I welcome the improved security situation in the West Bank, and hope that it will result in the urgent lifting of restrictions on access and movement for ordinary Palestinians, facilitating greater economic activity and growth.The situation in Gaza, however, remains of serious concern.  While I welcome the ceasefire that has been observed by Hamas and Israel since June, I believe that the situation on the ground remains critical.  I have consistently called for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza, in particular through the re-opening of crossing points for people and goods.In my recent speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, I stated my strong view that improving conditions on the ground in the Palestinian Territories would make a significant and critical contribution to creating the right context for talks between Israel and the Palestinians to succeed.  I urged Israel to listen urgently to the concerned voice of the international community on the question of settlements, which continue to be built in the occupied Palestinian Territories. An end to their construction would be a strong and welcome signal of good faith.  I also raised these concerns directly with Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, when I met with her in July.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	732	I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations and, in certain circumstances to schools and colleges, throughout the country.  It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.Primary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the programme may apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school itself.  Any sports facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation and which would be located within school grounds would have to meet these same conditions.Applications from primary and post-primary schools and colleges on their own are not considered under the programme.  Responsibility for the provision of sports facilities in schools and colleges is a matter in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Education and Science.Under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme my Department received 9 applications made jointly by schools and sports clubs.  One of these applications was successful.  However, these figures may not reflect applications made to develop community and multi-sport facilities that benefit schools and clubs alike.It is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of joint applications made by one or more clubs.  Many clubs join together to build and use sports facilities.  However, such clubs may apply under the names of the clubs or the name of the club or organisation that owns the land where the facilities are to be built or under a separate name.  However, in assessing applications consideration is given to applications for facilities that will accommodate several sports in one location.Significant funding is allocated under the programme for the provision of community and multi-sports facilities with over €9.35 million invested in 103 separate projects in 2008 alone.  Since 1998 sports capital funding of over €135 million was allocated to community and municipal multi-sport projects.  These projects include sports facilities built by local authorities, community sports facilities and multi-sport clubs.

As that letter pointed out, given the level of demand for funding and the amount of funding available under the Programme, it is not possible for my Department to allocate grants to every applicant.  In this instance, the club did not meet a number of the qualifying conditions of the Programme in that the evidence of own funding and the evidence of planning compliance provided was not sufficient.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 and 283 together.Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations.  It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.Since 1998 the Sports Capital Programme has allocated over €725m to 7,401 sports facility projects.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs, to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.For a project to be considered for funding under the programme it must first meet a certain number of basic requirements such as showing evidence of the minimum required level of own funding or evidence of freehold or sufficiently long leasehold to ensure that the facility stays in sporting use.  All projects that do not meet these minimum requirements are considered ineligible and are not assessed for funding.When assessing applications that have met these minimum requirements the Department uses a number of criteria.  Applications are scored according to how well they meet these criteria and then ranked in order of priority within their own county.  The amount of funding available for distribution under the Programme in each county is determined on a pro-rata basis based on the 2006 Census of Population.  This method of assessment and allocation ensures that all counties, including those with growing populations, receive proportionate levels of funding.  However, if a county does not have a sufficient number of eligible projects it is of course not possible to allocate that county's share of the total allocations.  In these cases the funding is distributed to projects elsewhere.The 2008 programme was advertised on 13th and 14th of January and the deadline for receipt of applications was 29th February for paper-based applications and 7th March for online applications.  Prior to the deadline for the 2008 programme a total of 44 applications were received from County Kildare seeking a total of €8,295,720 for projects totalling €13,542,722.  I announced the allocations under the 2008 programme at the end of July and a list of the grant allocations, including €1,336,500 to 21 clubs in Kildare for 2008 together with allocations to projects in Co. Kildare under previous years allocations, is available on the Department's website at http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/.

This number is expected to increase to over 1,050 by year end.Details of the capital or other grant aid awarded in 2007 is set out on the Department's website www.dast.gov.ie.
It is not possible to provide an estimate of the number likely to receive capital or other grant aid in 2009, as, inter alia, some of the Department's funding schemes and programmes are demand led and are subject to the criteria and arrangements for the schemes and programmes in question and to the budgetary situation.

Request for capital arts grants are normally dealt with under my Department's ACCESS (Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme) scheme; however this scheme is currently closed for applications.Revenue funding for the arts is provided by the Arts Council and I would refer the Deputy to the Council's website www.artscouncil.ie for details of the Council’s funding schemes.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	738	Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:to stimulate public interest in the arts;to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;to assist in improving standards in the arts.The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.Funding for the Arts Council has increased from €47.67 million in 2002 to €81.6 million in 2008 — an increase of over 71%.  These are significant amounts of money in any context.  This funding has transformed the arts, increasing access to and participation in the arts, and has provided an excellent platform for future development.My Department does provide some of current funding for the arts and six projects have been allocated grants totalling €555,000 in 2008.  My Department also provides capital grants to arts organisations under the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS).  ACCESS is a key element in the Government's regional arts strategy and has greatly improved access to and participation in the arts for large numbers of people nationwide.  The scheme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces.Facilities funded to date include integrated arts centres, theatres, galleries, studio, and creative and performance spaces.  In this manner my Department provides the bulk of capital funding for building and refurbishing arts facilities around the country, mainly in the not for profit sector, while the Arts Council provides the ongoing revenue support for many of the facilities.In 2008 16 projects were allocated funding under ACCESS, this comprised 13 ACCESS II reserve list projects and 3 other capital grants.  These grants amounted to €17.39m in addition to grants allocated in previous years.

The LEADER elements will be delivered through Axes 3 & 4 of the Programme and will see €425m available for LEADER type activities, an almost threefold increase on the level of funding available under the 2000-2006 programming round.The most significant changes include increased rates of aid from 50% to 75% for community projects and an increase in the aid ceilings for capital projects from €100,000 to €200,000 in most cases. In exceptional circumstances, provision has been made for grant aid of €500,000 for non-commercial community flagship projects.The process for selecting Local Action Groups to deliver the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme is now at an advanced stage. I expect to announce the selection of the Groups to implement the Programme and the allocation of funding shortly.  I anticipate that the Programme will be open to applications to the Local Action Groups for funding in all areas of the country shortly thereafter.The Rural Development Programme provides that the contribution by the Programme to the administration budget of each Local Action Group is set at a maximum of 20% of the public funding awarded to the Group. Within this administration allocation, it is a matter for the Board of each individual Local Action Group to provide, as it deems appropriate, for the appointment of staff and the necessary accommodations to implement the Programme.  My Department will, of course, continue to provide guidance to all Local Action Groups in this regard.

The Executive has advised that following a review of the person's rent supplement entitlement, it was established that his rent had increased and is in excess of the prescribed maximum rent limits for his area of residence and the size of his household.  He has been advised that rent supplement would be paid in excess of the prescribed maximum limit, as an exceptional measure, for a three month period, from September 2008. This three month period was granted in order to allow him time to secure accommodation within the prescribed rent limits.  The Executive has further advised that he has been afforded a right of appeal to the HSE Appeals Office.

The Defence Forces Regulations state that the Quarters must be vacated within 15 days of leaving the service.  The current situation has arisen as a result of a failure to do so.Following previous attempts to resolve the situation regarding the unauthorised occupation of the quarters in question, a letter was sent to the occupiers on the 11 September 2008 as a first stage in commencing a process of dialogue.  The occupiers were requested to make arrangements to vacate the premises and make alternative arrangements for their accommodation as soon as possible, but no later that the end of October 2008.  On the 18th September a further letter issued to the occupiers inviting them to a meeting with the Department on the 23 September.  At that meeting they were informed that the deadline was not set in stone and that, if at all possible, my Department would welcome the opportunity to work with them to achieve a solution favourable to all parties. It would appear now, that arising from that meeting, all occupiers wish to purchase the quarters.My officials undertook to review the possibility of selling to the occupiers and a further meeting has been scheduled for the end of October.  It is hoped that substantial progress will have been made by that time to facilitate a solution that meets the needs of both the occupiers and the Defence Forces.  I am encouraged that the process of dialogue has commenced and hope that it will come to a satisfactory conclusion.  As discussions are currently ongoing I do not consider a meeting between myself and the residents is necessary or appropriate at this time.

One of the eligibility criteria for this scheme was that all expenditure had to be incurred by the local authority by 30 June 2008 in order to be guaranteed funding.To ensure the continuing development of recycling infrastructure a new scheme, the Waste Recycling Capital Grant Scheme, was established in July 2008.  Under the terms of this scheme expenditure which has been incurred by local authorities since 1 January 2008 is eligible for grant assistance.  A grant rate of 75% of approved costs is generally applicable for civic amenity sites under this scheme.My Department has been in contact with Wexford County Council regarding the civic amenity site in question. It is anticipated that Wexford County Council will shortly be submitting a request that the planned facility be considered under the terms of the new grant scheme.  This will enable the local authority to draw down grant aid on all eligible expenditure which has been incurred since 1 January 2008, as well as future eligible expenditure on the planned civic amenity site.

Information is also published in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.Loan finance of €220 million, from the Housing Finance Agency, was available in each of the past three years to underpin activity under the Shared Ownership Scheme.  Some €129 million, €99 million and €137 million was drawn down by local authorities from these allocations in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 to 312, inclusive, together.The principal recommendation in the Ninth Progress Report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution (APOCC), on Private Property, was for the implementation of the central proposal of the 1973 majority "Kenny Report", a  "designated area scheme" under which local authorities would be empowered to compulsorily acquire land for general development purposes, at its existing use value plus 25%, rather than at open market value.  In the light of a range of substantive legal, practical and financial considerations, successive Governments since the 1970s have not proceeded with such a scheme.The Government has approved the drafting of a Designated Land (Housing Development) Bill to provide for a "use it or lose it" scheme.  The General Scheme of the Bill provides for:powers for planning authorities to enter into a binding agreement with, or  impose requirements on, the owners of designated land in order to bring such land into housing development;an amended compensation mechanism whereby designated land, if not developed in agreement with, or in accordance with requirements imposed by, the relevant planning authority, could be compulsorily acquired at below market value; andas a possible alternative to compulsory acquisition, the imposition by planning authorities of an annual development incentive levy on designated land. It is anticipated that the Bill will be drafted by the end of 2008.The General Scheme also provides for the mandatory registration of land purchase options by the Property Registration Authority, a statutory body operating under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The registration and publication of information on property transactions generally would appear to be a matter for consideration by that Authority in the first instance. I am considering what other mechanisms might be appropriate to achieve the goals of the "Kenny Report".The APOCC recommended the establishment of a body drawn from planning, construction, property and environmental interests, as well as State regulatory bodies concerned with planning, to meet as a national forum which would aim to inform national planning policy based on experience and research commissioned from appropriate research agencies.  The Housing Forum, first established under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, was reconstituted under the National Agreement Towards 2016 in December 2006, and continues to provide the social partners with an opportunity to contribute to housing policy development.  In addition, the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 provides that a High Level Working Group involving representatives of the Social Partners will be established to consider, within overall Government economic and budgetary policy, measures for achieving more balanced regional development, including progress in implementation of the National Spatial Strategy, taking account of the analysis by the NESC.The Strategic Infrastructure Act, which has been fully in force since 31 January 2007, amended the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for:the introduction of a streamlined ‘strategic consent process' for strategic infrastructure of  national importance provided by statutory bodies and private promoters, andthe restructuring of An Bord Pleanála to allow for the establishment of a Strategic Infrastructure Division to handle all major infrastructure projects.The types of infrastructure eligible to be considered under this Act include major transport, environmental, and energy related projects. The final decision as to whether a particular project will be processed under the Strategic Consent Process is a matter in each case for An Bord Pleanála having regard to specified criteria as laid down in the Act.Notwithstanding its recommendations, the APOCC acknowledged that legislation on compulsory acquisition of land provides a sophisticated and subtle set of rules that brings considerable rigour to the assessment of compensation, and provides an exacting but fair arbitration system for determining such compensation.  This legislation is supported by a very significant body of case law that has established relevant precedent and principles across a very wide range of circumstances.  The consolidation and amendment of this legislation would be a major and very time-consuming task, and I am satisfied that this is not a legislative priority.  Accordingly, I have no proposals to undertake such an initiative at this time.The Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006 amended the rules of compulsory acquisition to provide that the value of any land lying 10 metres or more below the surface is to be taken to be nil, unless it can be shown to be of greater value by a claimant.Following a review by an expert steering group, draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas were published for public consultation in February 2008 and are intended to replace the 1999 Residential Density Guidelines.  These draft guidelines are accompanied by an Urban Design Manual that illustrates essential criteria and best practice for sustainable urban residential development.  It is intended to finalise the guidelines before the end of this year and to publish them under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which requires planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.While my Department has appropriate links with academic institutions to inform and assist policy-making in the broad area of rural and regional planning, no specific research has been commissioned by my Department to date into the direct and indirect costs of rural housing.  I have no proposals at this time to commission such research.

Monitoring at permanent and mobile monitoring stations by the EPA and local authorities confirms that air quality in Ireland is good and does not, at this time, provide any data in support of any such extension.The question of the need for extending the air quality monitoring network including to cover additional urban areas due to population changes has been raised with the Environmental Protection Agency in the context of an overall monitoring review which has been requested by my Department as part of the Programme for Government commitment on monitoring air quality. I expect the EPA will conclude this review by year end.This morning the Solid Fuel Trade Group and I signed a new voluntary agreement to maintain low levels in the sulphur emissions of bituminous coal and petcoke and to maintain existing limitations through smokeless zones on the marketing, sale and distribution of solid fuels.  The agreement also provides that in the towns and environs of Athlone, Carlow, Clonmel and Ennis, SFTG Ltd. will maintain the smokeless fuel market penetration level of 75%, as a percentage of overall solid fuel sales, as set out in previous agreements.  These 4 towns are additional to those already covered by smokeless zones.

Since 2000, over €620 million has been provided for homeless services, between accommodation-related costs met through my Department and the local authorities, and care services funded through the Health Service Executive.  In 2008 alone, almost €92 million in current funding is being provided.  Further significant capital funding has also been provided for the development of new facilities.Future funding of actions under the strategy will be a matter for consideration in the context of the annual Estimates process and it will also be essential to ensure that optimum efficiency and value for money are secured from funding provided.  In that context, the Homeless Agency in Dublin has been undertaking a comprehensive review of services and a value for money review; when completed shortly, these will play an important role in informing the development of the strategy's implementation plan and consideration of associated funding issues.Central interlinked objectives of the new Government strategy are the elimination of the need to sleep rough and the long-term occupation of emergency homeless accommodation.  Accordingly, while it is essential that there is adequate capacity in emergency accommodation to respond to underlying need, this should be achieved mainly through eliminating long-term occupation of existing emergency accommodation, rather than providing additional accommodation of this kind.  Nevertheless, it is recognised that surges may arise in the demand for emergency accommodation from time to time.  The situation in this regard is kept under review at local level, with appropriate responses, in certain cases through the adoption of specific winter strategies, being put in place as necessary.

The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) has been identified as one of a range of options offering potential in meeting the needs of certain homeless households, particularly single person households who are capable of independent living.  This is supported by the initial feedback from a number of pilot projects already in operation where RAS is used to accommodate homeless households.

In addition to this, a further discount of €3,809 is provided.  Thus, a local authority house with a market value of €140,000 would be available for purchase at some €94,200 by a tenant of ten or more years' standing.  By any account, this is a generous discount.The proceeds of the sale of local authority houses to tenants are used to part-fund improvements to, and planned maintenance programmes in, the local authority housing stock.  I consider that the terms of the present tenant purchase scheme strike a reasonable balance between the aspirations of certain tenants to own their own homes and the needs of all other local authority tenants. While I have no proposals to amend the financial terms of the current scheme, I will continue to keep them under review.

Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and in that context the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision making procedures (2003/35/EC).Regulations transposing the European Communities (Access to information on the Environment) Directive 2003/4/EC were signed and came into effect on 1 May 2007.The process to transpose Directive 2003/35/EC is well advanced with legislation completed to amend the majority of the relevant consent systems pertaining to that Directive in the Irish legislative framework.  Work is continuing on the outstanding issues, and will be finalised by the Departments concerned at the earliest possible date.Upon completion of the full transposition of Directive 2003/35/EC, I, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will ensure that the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention is submitted to Government and laid before the Dáil.

These land parcels were found to be slightly over-claimed and when the applicant was queried about this, he agreed that the area determined by the Department, 7.92 hectares, was correct.  As this error had not been rectified when the Disadvantaged Areas payment issued, payment was issued in respect of the area which was not in error, 23.23 hectares.  However, as the matter has since been rectified, payment will issue shortly in respect of 7.92 hectares.With regard to the National Reserve, the person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B which catered for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments could include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments. The person named applied under Category B(i) in relation to investment in leased land and was granted an allocation of 23.83 entitlements.The National Reserve does not provide for the allocation of entitlements on land purchased in 2008. The person named did not submit National Reserve applications for the years 2006, 2007 or 2008.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	774	While there has been an increase in reactor numbers and herd incidence in Galway this year, the herd incidence for Galway remains below the national average.Studies to date have failed to demonstrate any association between enhancements to infrastructure and deteriorating levels of animal disease.  In the same way that my Department is required to negotiate permissions to capture badgers with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the promoters of roads, rail projects or gas lines are also required to have regard to environmental considerations and must equally obtain prior approvals for their plans from the NPWS. Officials from my Department do not participate in such deliberations, which in any event fall within the competence of the NPWS.Issues relating to wild deer are primarily the responsibility of the Parks and Wildlife Divisions of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department does not operate an official programme for the eradication of tuberculosis in deer and therefore does not routinely test or sample deer herds for TB. It does, however, provide ongoing advice to keepers on disease control measures and biosecurity in relation to wildlife, including deer. Further, when an outbreak of TB is identified in a cattle herd, an epidemiological investigation is carried out by my Department to identify the likely sources of the infection and thus to provide relevant advice to the farmer. These investigations reveal that deer are seldom implicated in bovine TB outbreaks.I am advised that the likely causes for the increase in infection emanates from infected local badger populations and residual infection.  The policy of my Department is to deal with the former source of breakdowns by removing badgers where appropriate, and I am satisfied this is being done effectively in Galway.  The residual component of the problem is being addressed by the application of a more stringent severe test interpretation and a greater use of ancillary tests, such as Gamma Interferon blood testing, which may result in a higher reactor removal rate but which should, in the longer term, help to clear the infection more rapidly.With regard to field staff resources, currently 2 Technical Agricultural Officers  and 8 Farm Relief Service (F.R.S.) operatives are responsible for implementing the Wildlife programme in Co. Galway.  Department and F.R.S. staff, as a matter of routine, are upskilled on a regular basis and avail of improving methodology and technology.  The percentage of agricultural land under treatment in Co. Galway increased from 11.1% in December 2006 to 14.5% in December 2007, a significant increase in such a large county.  The percentage of agricultural land under treatment in the county was 15.2% as at 1 July 2008. I believe that the existing staffing resource available for badger capturing in Galway is adequate.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	783	I am aware that there are more females than males entering the teaching profession and believe that it is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children's lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools.I believe that teaching is an attractive profession for both men and women.  Teaching is fulfilling work which makes a huge social contribution.  This Government wants to attract and reward the best teachers and has undertaken a number of initiatives to enhance the status of the profession.  Not least of these is the establishment of the Teaching Council as a professional regulatory  body.In November 2005 the Report of the Primary Education Committee, ‘Males into Primary Teaching' was launched.  The Primary Education Committee was established in order to examine a range of issues in relation to males entering primary teaching, and to make recommendations on short-term and long-term strategies to increase the numbers in this regard.  The Report draws on the professional insight of key experts in this area as well as drawing on a number of relevant research studies.One of the key recommendations in this report was that a co-ordinated promotion campaign, which would encourage boys as well as girls to enter primary teaching should be undertaken.  This promotion campaign commenced in 2006 and promoted  the rewards of being a teacher such as the value to society, work/life balance, career satisfaction, diversity of skills, professional development, conditions of employment and job security.The number of male and female primary school teachers in each county is not available.  In June 2008 the position nationally was 4,838 male and 25,346 female primary school teachers.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-08 00:00:00	Prelude	784	The issues referred to in the question from my Department's perspective are that of funding for schools to help deal with their day to day running costs.  Firstly, I wish to state that my Department is aware of the funding pressures on schools. It is also clear that there is a need for further improvements on funding levels.  However, this can only be achieved in a manner that is consistent with prudent management of the Irish economy.It is important to recognise that progress has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €178.58.  This represents an increase of nearly 120%  in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.  This compares to a cumulative increase in the Consumer Price Index between 2000 and 2008 of over 30%.The value of the ancillary services grant for the employment of caretakers and secretaries in our schools has almost trebled in the same period, from €50.79 under the PESP (Programme for Economic and Social Progress) scheme, to the current rate of €151.50 per pupil.In 2008 alone the Department has paid around €167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs.  The improvements in the capitation and ancillary grants mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools has increased this year by €21 to €330 per pupil. Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €457 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €40,000 to meet its day to day running costs.  That same school today is receiving almost €100,000, which is all paid from my Department.  This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by the Department.  By any standards this is a very significant improvement within a relatively short period of time.I am committed to increasing the funding for primary schools as resources permit.

Mayo continuing contact with the Visiting Teacher who has worked with them to date in assisting their children to access the full range of educational opportunity. New referrals continue to be received and assessed in the normal way for attention by the Visiting Teacher service as soon as is practicable. While it has been necessary to make this arrangement in the short-term, the management of the service is currently examining ways in which to serve the needs of visually impaired children in the county in the medium and longer term. I can assure the Deputy that there has been no reduction in the overall Visiting Teacher numbers nationally.

The priority target group of Further Education programmes generally is those who are educationally disadvantaged and who lack basic skills.Between 2002 and 2007 expenditure on these areas increased by over 50%, from €256 million to €392 million.  This increased investment helped to improve opportunities by expanding the number of places in further education programmes from 44,000 in 2002 to 49,000 in 2007.These include:More than 30,000 places in the Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programme;5,000 places on the Vocational Training Opportunities (VTOS) Scheme;9,500 places on the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI);Almost 3,700 Youthreach places; andAlmost 1,100 places on the Senior Traveller Training Centre programme.In addition the adult literacy programme provided for 44,000 learners in 2007 compared with 28,000 in 2002.Other significant improvements have been made in the further education area in recent years:the Adult Guidance Initiative has been expanded to cater for the increased number of learnersfunding for childcare has been expanded to include learners on the Back to Education Initiativefree tuition on BTEI programmes has been extended to include all those with less than upper second level educationWe are committed to developing adult education programmes as resources permit.

These projects are now progressing through procurement with the 1st Bundle of 4 post primary schools likely to commence construction by the end of the year. Procurement of the 2nd Bundle of 6 schools (5 post-primary schools and 1 primary school) commenced in September 08. Work is continuing on identifying the 3rd and 4th bundles of School Projects. A number of schools are being considered for inclusion in these bundles.On the Third Level programme 17 projects in 9 institutions were announced in November 2005 and I intend that the first bundle of these will be offered to the market this year.My Department will continue to use the PPP model as appropriate in order to supplement the programme of school construction under the traditional route.

This funding includes a block grant to cover core teaching and research activities, grant in respect of undergraduate tuition fees and earmarked funding for specific purposes.There have been substantial improvements in the funding of the university sector in recent years. Recurrent funding allocated to the University sector has increased from €631m in 2004 to some €831m in 2008. This excludes separately provided programmes of funding for capital, for research and development and from the Strategic Innovation Fund. This represents an increase of some 32% since 2004 and an increase of some 150% since 1997.The following table sets out the recurrent funding allocated to the HEA for the university sector since 1996 together with the amount of this funding which covered the grant in lieu of tuition fees.YearRecurrent Grant incl.

From 1980 to 2004 the participation rate grew from 20% to 55%, one of the highest increases among OECD countries. The very steady improvement in the educational profile of the Irish population can be observed by comparing the educational attainment levels of different age groups in the population, for example, the proportion of persons aged 25-34 (41%) with higher education is double the equivalent proportion of 45-54 year olds (21%).YearFull-timePart-timeTotal1996-9757,3898,41565,8041997-9860,5629,35469,9161998-99108,50927,764136,2731999-0066,18111,29777,4782000-0168,49011,30879,7982001-0271,36013,80285,1622002-0370,08213,62383,7052003-0472,43713,06685,5032004-0575,84315,71091,5532005-0675,03715,30390,3402006-0776,52415,08391,607YearFull-timePart-timeTotal1996-97100,20422,795122,9991997-98104,43925,439129,8781998-99108,50927,764136,2731999-00115,69631,469147,1652000-01119,99132,265152,2562001-02124,589349,65159,5542002-03129,28334,680163,9632003-04133,88734,000167,8872004-05133,69134,509168,2002005-06136,71931,354168,0732006-07138,362Not available
