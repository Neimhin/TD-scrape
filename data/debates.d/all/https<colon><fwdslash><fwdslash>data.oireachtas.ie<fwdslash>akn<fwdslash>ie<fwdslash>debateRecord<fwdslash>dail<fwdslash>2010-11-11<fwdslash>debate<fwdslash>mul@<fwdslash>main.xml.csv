#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the report published yesterday by the European Court of Auditors stating the closure of the Greencore sugar factory in Mallow in 2006 with the loss of over 300 jobs may not have been necessary.  I ask for a debate on the report in this House so the Tánaiste can give an account of the night of 20 February 2006 when the factory——

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	39	This is a matter of political principle and also one of serious importance.  We are referring to a national industry which was formerly owned by the State and which was sold by it.

The point I am making relates to the suspension of Standing Orders to discuss an issue of major national importance.  In fairness, the Ceann Comhairle is stating that Members will be accommodated in some other way.  That is not the issue; the issue is that this is the appropriate mechanism to deal with the matter in question.

I refer to the motions to suspend Standing Orders in order to allow a debate such as that being requested to take place.  Standing Order 32 exists for a reason and this is exactly the type of situation in respect of which it applies.  It is quite rare that there would be a request to discuss a matter such as that raised by Deputy Sherlock and others this morning.  I do not wish to have an argument with the Ceann Comhairle.

A submission has also been received in respect of the latter.  We will endeavour to provide adequate time under either or both of those headings.

We have given the Ceann Comhairle power, under the Standing Orders of the House, to deal with special situations that arise.  This is one such situation and the Ceann Comhairle should use the Standing Order in respect of it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I have advised the House that we are going to deal with this matter and that it will be accommodated under the headings I have outlined.

Accommodating a question-and-answer session in respect of the private notice question seems to be the best way to elicit the information Members require.

We could accommodate the debate that is urgently required if the sitting were suspended for a minute or two so that the Order of Business might be changed.  The debate being requested could be held at noon.  I am trying to be of assistance.

The Adjournment will not deal with a matter of fundamental importance wherein, on the basis of an indigenous product, 250 manufacturing jobs were being provided——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	127	We cannot debate the matter now.  I have indicated that we are giving serious consideration to having the matter dealt with in the form of a private notice question.  The latter is not the Adjournment.

It is not in the interests of any Member to be disorderly in respect of this matter.  As Deputies Stagg and Kehoe pointed out, Standing Order 32 is in place to deal with specific situations such as that which has arisen.  If it is seen outside the House that the Ceann Comhairle does not believe this matter to be sufficiently serious in nature to allow a debate on it to take place under Standing Order 32, that will reflect badly on the House.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	131	We will be accommodating the matter under Standing Orders.

This is the first opportunity of the day for Members to request a debate on a serious issue relating to a major industry.  Is that not correct?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	138	We are going to provide the opportunity to do it.

We need to hear from the Tánaiste, who was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at the time and who was at the Council of Ministers.  We have a report from the EU Court of Auditors that states very clearly that the factory did not have to be closed, it was a profitable business, it had enormous potential and was a modern operation.  The issue which Deputies and the Labour Party want to get to the bottom of is why it ended up being closed down.  What role did the Tánaiste——

If the Tánaiste is willing to come into the House, address the issue, tell the House how she handled it when she was Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, why the factory was closed and is prepared to answer questions about her role at the time, that will address the issue.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. a5 and b5 shall be decided without debate; and that the proceedings in relation to No. 5 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the speeches of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security or a person nominated in his stead and of the main spokespersons for the Government, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case the speech of each other member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and Members may share time.

Is the proposal for dealing with No. a5 — motion re membership of committees; No. b5 Motion re proposal that Dáil Éireann notes the report of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service entitled Report on Macroeconomic Policy and Effective Fiscal and Economic Governance, without debate, agreed?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	173	No.  Can I explain why, which is normal practice?  No. b5 concerns the Report on Macroeconomic Policy and Effective Fiscal and Economic Governance, which is a key part of what Deputy Bruton has been talking about for several years and is part of our document Reinventing Government, the thesis and essence of which we support.  Part of the document relates to transparency and accountability in government.  Today we have seen more of the same of what the Government demonstrated for many years, that is, a lack of transparency and accountability, an unwillingness to discuss and debate an issue which caused the demise of an important industry in this country and affects the livelihoods of many farmers and workers.There are 450,000 people out of work, people are facing economic uncertainty and are threatened with many other kites being flown by the Government on the budget, an area into which I will not stray.  As the Tánaiste would not agree to a meeting between the Whips to set aside time for a debate of such importance, we oppose the Order of Business.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The Labour Party opposes the Order of Business because of the failure of the Tánaiste and Government to address the closure of the Mallow sugar factory.  Yesterday the report from the Court of Auditors was published which states this was one of Europe's most efficient producers and closed down its large, modern and potentially efficient sugar factory.  In plain English, this factory did not have to close.  A profitable factory and industry was closed with the loss of 300 jobs and the knock-on consequences for local businesses in Mallow and north Cork and farmers which were supplying it across a large area of Munster and Leinster.We have attempted to have this matter addressed properly in a number of ways.  There is no point in having an Adjournment debate where a Minister of State will come in and read a script.  Private notice questions will be answered by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, who he was not the relevant Minister at the time.  The Tánaiste was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when this happened, and attended the Council of Ministers and has responsibility for this decision.  We need to have accountability in this House for how she carried out her role at the time and why a factory was closed with the subsequent consequences.There was a perfectly profitable industry which was scuttled with the loss of jobs, business and the farmers who supplied it.  The Tánaiste spoke as if the discussion earlier had not taken place and bizarrely read out the Order of Business as if this was not an issue.  It is an issue and it will have to be addressed.

I oppose the proposal in order that No. 14 is adjourned at noon and that another section be inserted, No. 15, which would be statements on the Greencore factory in Mallow and that the Ceann Comhairle allows the proper procedure of statements of 15 minutes each and a question and answer session at the end of the debate.  That would facilitate the House in debating this urgent matter.  This is the correct place to argue this because it is an amendment to the Order of Business which the Ceann Comhairle has put to the House.  I ask that it be adjourned——

I will give one example from the statement she made.  She says that the Court of Auditors laid the blame at the feet of the European Commission.  The Court of Auditors blamed the European Commission for working off old figures and that it did not take into account Greencore's consolidation as a result of the closing of the Carlow plant.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	373	We are getting into a detailed debate on this matter at this point.

Who was responsible for it having the old figures and who was responsible for it not knowing what consolidation took place between Carlow and Mallow?  Was it the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at the time, whose job it was to tell the Commission?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I will not allow this incident to develop into a full-scale debate on the matter.

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	379	On the same point, the blame cannot be laid at the Commission if the Commission was working off information that was inadequate, out of date and inaccurate.  If we are going to have a discussion we need to have the person responsible.  The Government at the time held a golden share in Greencore——
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	380	It was a special share, not a golden share.

We need an explanation as to how the Government was overseeing the information being supplied by Greencore and what efforts it made to ensure that the information was correct.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	382	All these questions can be asked later.

On a point of order, the Tánaiste has been kind enough to tell the House we will have a debate.  Will she say when that debate will be held, its duration and who will represent the Government?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I put the Order of Business to the House.  In the ruckus that was happening earlier in the House I indicated that I was prepared——

The Taoiseach stated it was a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  On 11 February 2009, the Commission decided that the payment would have to be made accountable in accordance with the law and that it should be equivalent to the party leaders' allowance.

Currently, they are paid €43,000 into their pockets, tax free and to be used on whatever they like.

Two years ago I was on RTE with a European Union official who would not debate with me on air, which meant we had to be interviewed separately.  Has the Government removed from its website the names, addresses and payments made to farmers in light of the EU ruling that the information does not need to be published?

It was raised yesterday by my party leader, Deputy Kenny.  The House has been given a commitment that legislation will be introduced to deal with the problem.  Such an undertaking was given to the House during the debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009.  The Opposition parties tabled amendments in an attempt to accommodate people with mortgage arrears.  The Minister said at the time that he would take the "legislative route".  He said he would tell the House when he proposed to introduce such legislation.  I had a meeting yesterday——

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I appreciate the words of those who have been kind enough to raise the matter with me.  As we all know, the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010 will create a new directly elected office of the mayor of Dublin within the current local government framework.  The Bill sets out the criteria for the eligibility of candidates and other electoral matters.  It provides that the mayor will have specific powers with regard to regional strategy on planning, transport, water and waste services.  The Bill also deals with the establishment, powers and responsibilities of the regional authority of Dublin, which I understand will be chaired by the directly elected mayor.  The regional authority will replace the Dublin regional authority.The reaction to the introduction of this legislation has been varied.  I suppose the jury is still out on it.  As a member of Fianna Fáil, I will support this Bill as an element of the programme for Government.  Nobody should misinterpret the fact that I am speaking from behind the Labour Party benches, as this is where I sit.  The election of a directly elected mayor is one aspect of the local government reforms set out in the 2007 programme for Government, to which I strongly subscribe.  I am aware that the Green Paper on Local Government, Stronger Local Democracy: Options for Change, was published in April 2008.  It outlines the options for the direct election of the mayor of Dublin.  In May 2009, the Government announced its decision to introduce a directly elected mayor for the Dublin region in 2010, which was a year earlier than previously proposed.  I understand that a Cabinet committee is currently finalising the policy decisions that will be contained in the White Paper.This Bill was published last month by our colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  On the day of its publication, the Minister said, "the election of the Dublin mayor will be the most significant change in Irish local government since the 19th century".  I do not refer to the Minister's comments to upset my colleagues from rural constituencies.  I should state, in case people cannot recognise it from my accent, that I am a proud Dubliner.  I was not born in Tallaght, strangely enough, but in Holles Street, which is near Leinster House in the city centre.  I lived in Stephen Street with my family and went to school in Clarendon Street.  I moved to Tallaght 40 years ago.  Deputy Upton often reminds me that I spent a considerable part of my formative years in Crumlin.I might not have emerged as a Fianna Fáil member were it not for my experiences in the constituency shared by Deputies Upton, Ó Snodaigh and others.  I will not deny my Dublin roots.As the Minister stated:The citizens of Dublin will elect a local government leader equipped with a democratic mandate unsurpassed in the history of the city.  The Mayor will be elected to drive improvements and efficiencies in the Region's local government, and will champion Dublin, at home and abroad, as a good place to live, work and invest.I understand that a directly elected mayor "will also deliver significantly strengthened leadership for the city and region, with enhanced accountability and a direct connection with the citizen, thereby reinvigorating local government".I feel strongly about the development of local government in my city and in my region.  I was not born a politician nor did I set out to be one but when I moved to Tallaght, I became involved in local issues.  I pointed out at a committee meeting yesterday that the then parish priest of Springfield, Dr. Richard Sherry, did not share my politics.  One does not usually know the politics of a priest but he told me about his.  I do not know if this will embarrass him in his retirement in Donnybrook but he was the man who first suggested to me that some day I might make a reasonable politician and he appointed me to the local school board.

My progress through the political system was slow and I ended up on the local authority in 1991.  I was a little older than most starting out.  I am not ashamed of that and I was delighted to be a member of Dublin County Council.  I strongly supported the reorganisation of local government in 1994 because I believed the break up of the large council and the establishment of smaller councils in south Dublin, where I live, Dún Laoghaire and Fingal with the retention of the city council was important.In recent times, people commenting on the scope of local government in the region have said there are too many councillors and the structure is unwieldy.  However, I believed in 1994 that this was a good idea because it involved bringing local government to the people.  People often said to me, for example, when I was on the old county council that I, as a Tallaght-based councillor, was making decisions about Swords and other towns far from Tallaght and the reverse was also the case.  There was a great deal of criticism in the wider community about decisions being made by local authority members who had no contact with the areas affected.  Smaller councils were a better idea and, over the years, even though there has been criticism, they have worked.  I was delighted to be re-elected to the council in 1999 and I became cathaoirleach, which was an important milestone in my attempt to contribute to local democracy.I do not wish to be disloyal to the Government but I was as upset as many other local councillors when I became a Dáil Deputy and could not continue as a member of the local authority.  I understand why the decision was taken but I believed it put us at a disadvantage.  I do not know whether other Members will admit it.  Deputies Upton and Ó Snodaigh served on Dublin local authorities.  I do not know whether it is right or wrong but not a day goes by without my office being contacted about issues relating to the local authority.  People always say that they know I am a TD and that I have moved on in that sense, but they still want me to deal with issues of concern to them.On any given day, constituents will contact Members about roadworks, street lighting and the pruning of trees.  I conducted an analysis recently of the calls I have received over the past number of months and, amazingly, I got more calls about bin collections in south Dublin than anything else.  People in communities feel strongly about the development of local services and local authorities and it is important in the context of this Bill to acknowledge that.  I am not ashamed that, as a Dáil Deputy, these are the issues constituents come to me about and these are the challenges they want me to deal with.  However, they are also in contact about social welfare issues and so on.Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country.  It did not fall out of the sky 30 years ago, as some people think.  It has been there forever and it has a rich heritage but it had particular challenges.  The Square celebrated its 20th birthday a few weeks ago.  When it was built, Tallaght turned a corner and there has been great progress in my town in recent years, with the development of the hospital, the transfer of the local authority to the town and the development of many other services one would expect in a major town.  I look forward to cheering on Shamrock Rovers next Sunday.  I hope the nice people of Sligo and, particularly their public representatives, enjoy their day out but I also hope Shamrock Rovers bring the cup back to Tallaght.I get many calls about the development of Tallaght and, in particular, about the number of unused and unoccupied apartments.  Many towns and villages have the same problem.  The property boom resulted in the development of many accommodation units.  Tallaght is no different from anywhere else but this is an issue.  I get many calls from people who say there should be a better way to deal with planning applications.  They ask why the Government does not take developments over.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was a progressive Minister for the Environment but even he held the view that the development of communities should be orchestrated primarily at local level.I recall being the lone Fianna Fáil member of the devolution commission established by the former Taoiseach, John Bruton, in 1995.  I am proud of the work we did because what we did was right.  We tried to create a scenario where powers were devolved from central government to local authorities.  Nowadays, I receive representations from people in Tallaght who want this reversed because decisions taken at local level by the county manager under the Housing Acts were not suitable.  The criticism is justified in that there are many unoccupied apartments in Tallaght village.  There is an unoccupied ten-storey block at the corner of the bypass and this affects the image of the town, as we try to attract people.  The issue of who should be responsible for planning and whether it should be administered by a local office or a national office, which I do not favour, is relevant to this Bill.  People who claim the Minister of the day would make different decisions might find that it is not way everything works.  With regard to the development of powers for the directly elected mayor of Dublin, it is important to understand that.A number of colleagues spoke about possible candidates who might run for mayor.  Prior to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle resuming the Chair, I said that while I am interested in the position——

The position should carry more powers.  The Minister has risen to the points made about the confusion that might exist in having a directly elected mayor of Dublin, the positions held by the mayors of the local authority areas of south Dublin, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire and the position of Lord Mayor of the city.  The question of the occupation of the Mansion House has cleared up some of the confusion but other views have been expressed that must be addressed.  I hope the Minister will continue to give this Bill and these aspects of it his attention.  He needs to tell us the powers a mayor will have.I mentioned that I am a fan of the position.  Major cities in the world have proved that having a major is a good idea.  I had the opportunity during recent years of meeting Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, the former and current London Mayor, respectively.  I note they will run head to head again for the position in the next election.  Both of them did the job and demonstrated the manner in which a directly elected mayor can operate.  It is important that the Minister understands the concerns of those of us who believe that the position, which is shrouded in controversy, should have real powers.  I hope he will deal with those issues.I read media speculation recently that there are issues to be dealt with in regard to the future transport needs of the city and how a mayor would deal with that issue.  It is important that point is made.  The transport needs of the city are particularly important.  I use public transport when I can, although it is not always possible because of the nature of what we do.  If I leave Leinster House to  go back to Tallaght, I can walk down to O'Connell Street, jump on the Luas and go straight to Tallaght — no problem.  However, if I want to go to other parts of my constituency — I do not have the same challenges as other colleagues in that I do not have to travel 60 miles across my constituency because, like other Dublin constituencies, it is quite small although it has a high population density — such as Crumlin, Walkinstown——

I cannot take the Luas as it does not serve those areas.  It is a little more difficult to travel to those areas by public transport.  The question of the future transport needs of this city are important.  I hope the Minister's proposals will embrace that issue in terms of the role of a mayor.  I note the different responsibilities the Minister will assign to a directly elected major of Dublin.  The transport needs of the city need to be examined in a special way.I was born in an age, and I do not mind admitting my age, where I remember horse drawn carriages and tramlines being pulled in Aungier Street and George's Street.  Bad mistakes were made at that time at the beginning of my life and I hope similar mistakes will not be made again.I will tell the Members this if they do not tell anybody about it — I remember as a small child living on the corner of Stephen's Street and George's Street and my granny running down the street when she heard that Alfie Byrne, that great Dublin man, was rambling up the street.  He used to do that.  I do not know whether many of today's politicians ramble around the streets and I do not want to give away my secrets.  I could invoke the names of many people who held the position of Lord Mayor of Dublin down the years who I remember and respect, not all of whom were from Fianna Fáil.  I remember Alfie Byrne, Robert Briscoe and many of those men of that generation.  Those men and women would have fitted nicely into the position of being a directly elected mayor.The jury is still out on this legislation and the debate on it is ongoing.  It is important legislation and I know the reaction to it in the House will be mixed.  I look forward to the Minister returning to the House and telling us more about his proposals.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his courtesy.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	549	——and some of the substantial issues in terms of what this legislation is about.  We are all citizens of this city, of which we are all proud, and we are also proud to be public representatives, in my case and that of Deputies O'Connor and Ó Snodaigh, in Dublin constituencies.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation both as a citizen of the city and as a public representative for a constituency.The proposal is one that I and the Labour Party support in general but not in its current format.  Unfortunately, it leaves much to be desired in terms of detail and setting out what the levels of responsibilities and accountability will be.  It is sufficiently flawed as it stands to make it ineffective and if it were to go ahead it could be counterproductive.  What is clearly required is an office that is accountable to the electorate and that has statutory instruments available to it to address all the aspects of governing a 21st century city region but this Bill clearly do not provide for that.  We are dealing with a very developed city in many ways in which there has been huge progress, a huge increase in population and great diversity but many challenges have to faced.  Unless they are clearly spelled out in regard to the role and responsibilities of an elected mayor we are possibly duplicating much of what is already in place but we have not been given a formula from which we can expect to operate and to know precisely what those responsibilities area.The Dublin city and county area is the home to more than 1.1 million people but the greater Dublin area, which takes in the local authority areas of Dublin as well as those of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, has a population of the order of 1.6 million.  Therefore, we are talking about a substantial area in terms of population.  The region is the gateway to our country, our administrative centre and it is largely the driver of the economy because of the scale of it.  The fundamental issues we face in the city and the region relating to water services, waste management, land use and transportation policy are all regional issues.  For this reason we must have the governance structures in place to effectively co-ordinate their provision.As Dublin is unique in Ireland due to its relative size, its challenges are also unique and an office with effective powers and responsibilities to drive the development of the city and the region is required.  However, what is proposed in this Bill is one layer of bureaucracy that will be placed on top of the existing local governance system without addressing any of the underlying issues.  These range from devolving more responsibility to local elected representatives and addressing the issue of duplication of responsibility with regard to governance functions and the fundamental issue of funding of local government.  That issue of exactly how local government is to be funded is becoming more acute, especially in the current climate.  There is a critical need to ensure such funding is available and can be delivered to keep our local government areas working effectively.We need a results driven system where the decision makers are accountable to the electorate as the existing system of part-time councillors trying to interact with full-time professionals does little for democratic accountability.  What is essentially being proposed is grafting an electoral mayoral office onto the existing system of councils, county manager and a regional authority.  It is a top-down approach that promises a substantial amount but, ultimately, delivers little when one delves into the detail that is described.  Local government reform is a far more pressing issue than introducing a flawed Bill for a mayor office to satisfy the demands of a Government coalition partner.One of the most striking flaws in the Bill is that the proposed mayor will have planning powers over counties where residents will not have a right to vote in the mayoral election.  Land use and transportation are among the most important issues over which the proposed post of elected mayor will have powers.  For the office of the mayor to be effective in co-ordinating land use and transportation policy, it must intervene in areas outside the Dublin city and county area.  How will the residents of these areas feel about tough planning policy being prepared on their behalf by someone for whom they are not entitled to vote?  This failing in the legislation leaves open the possibility of a perceived Dublin bias among residents in these areas who may believe policy is being formulated for the benefit of Dublin rather than their countries.  The legitimacy of the proposed office will come into question on this basis.Much like the intention to create the Dublin transportation authority, which quickly morphed into the National Transportation Authority, the Bill is being moved with excessive haste and fundamental issues are being overlooked in the interests of political expediency.  We have an opportunity to create an accountable and effective office for the region which would form the basis for similar offices in other urban areas.  This is how matters should be but what we are likely to get instead is an office whose legislative powers will require significant revision and alteration to keep up with local government reforms and, as such, will be incapable of addressing the strategic challenges facing the Dublin region.The elected mayor will not be Rudy Giuliani, Boris Johnston or even Ken Livingstone, to whom Deputy O'Connor referred.  He or she will have limited powers and little accountability and the office will generate substantial but as yet unknown costs to the Exchequer.  The mayor will not be independent of the Minister, city managers or the new offices and structures which will evolve from this new toothless tiger.  Surely what is needed for the capital city and, possibly at some future date, for other cities is a clearly defined role, clear powers and responsibilities, a defined budget proposal and transparent functions.  The citizens of the city must be protected from this costly indulgence by the Minister.I and my colleagues who either live in Dublin or represent the Dublin area feel strongly about how our city is run.  We are all very proud to be Dubliners or "Dubs" of one kind or another.  Even if some of us are not originally from the city, we are proud of where we live and, in particular, the areas and constituents we represent.

For instance, constituency boundary areas are not coterminous with policing or health service areas, which means one finds it difficult to define where an area fits.  There is no reason such practical matters cannot be addressed in the first instance, with a view to making life a little simpler for constituents and electors who are trying to identify who precisely they must contact in a particular set of circumstances.In the constituency I share with Deputy Ó Snodaigh an extraordinary decision was taken to shift the boundaries of the local authority area.  This resulted in one part of Drimnagh being transferred to the Ballyfermot area with the remainder left in Crumlin-Kimmage.  This decision did not make sense.  One must ask what is the driving force behind subdivisions of this type and why are practical matters of this nature not addressed.  While the change has bedded down and people are slowly but surely being accustomed to it, questions are still being asked about whom one needs to contact to elicit certain information and whether for certain purposes one is in Drimnagh, Ballyfermot or the Crumlin-Kimmage area.  This is a simple, practical issue which should have been addressed.Given that the city is the place where we live, work, socialise and send our children to school, it is important that we get the legislation right on behalf of citizens.  As it stands, the Bill will not tackle the fundamental issues that arise and contains too many gaps, especially in the area of accountability.  Moreover, a significant problem arises with regard to duplication and we do not have any idea what form of budgeting facilities or services will be in place.

Measaim féin go ndearna sé iarracht ach gur theip go huile agus hiomlán air toisc nach raibh sé chomh dáiríre agus a lig sé air.The Bill before us has been a pet project of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, for a long time.  We have been led to believe throughout that it was deal-breaking legislation for the Green Party and that its passage will be vital for the continuation of that party in the coalition with the Fianna Fáil Party.  I remember the promises made by the Green Party on local government reform when it was on the Opposition benches.  If this Bill is the full extent of its local government reforms, its policy in this area, like many of its other policies, lies in the dustbin or is about to be consigned to the dustbin.While the concept and policy behind the Bill may be good, the content is fundamentally flawed because it does not address the need for local government reform or the key issues of funding for and the powers and duties of local government.  It will create a mayor and another layer of bureaucracy around the mayoral office which the local councils in Dublin will be required to fund out of meagre and declining resources, a decline caused not only by the recession but also continuous Government cutbacks in capital funding.In 1977, long before I entered political office but not before I became involved in politics, Fianna Fáil abolished household rates and promised that henceforth local government would be funded from the central purse and the role of local authorities would be protected and encouraged through increasing funds from the Exchequer.  This has not been the case and the pot continues to decline to the extent that it does not cover the costs of the duties, responsibilities and needs of local authorities.  As any Member who tracks local authorities in Dublin and elsewhere will be aware, the greatest challenge facing local government each year is the annual estimates because local authorities have been starved of funds.This is a weak Bill which provides for the election of a new or renewed regional authority of Dublin.    It establishes the bureaucracy but will have very few powers.  The powers that should be taken from the city and county managers are not being transferred to someone who is accountable to the public.  The four existing councils in Dublin will be required to fund this authority from their own budgets and I take issue with the manner in which the authority will be appointed.  Although its members also perhaps should be elected, instead they will be appointed from the membership of the four local authorities, with five from Dublin City Council and two each from South Dublin, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils.  It is clear that the places for the 15 ordinary members will be divvied up among the large parties because there is nothing to dictate how this divvying up will take place.  For instance, there is not even an acknowledgement along the lines of the formula used within joint policing committees to the effect that appointments should reflect the party composition of the council or that it would be desirable for the authority to reflect all parties within the city.  Moreover, given that a layer of policing committees has been established, I note there does not appear to be any role for the mayor or the regional authority with regard to policing.  Although this issue must be considered, it is not in the Bill.There are quite a number of other omissions.  For instance, where is the role in respect of tourism?  The logic of establishing a Dublin regional authority is that it should deal with all tourism matters handled by Dublin Tourism in the past.  I attended a briefing by the city manager recently on how Dublin City Council laudably is becoming increasingly involved in trying to encourage and attract more business for the city.  However, if one sets up a regional authority and a mayoral office, this should be one of the duties and responsibilities of that office.  The vocational education committee is another such omission and consideration should be given to whether the mayor should have roles regarding an overarching Dublin VEC.I have a query that again shows the absolute failure of the Green Party to deliver on what it proposes.  It concerns the mechanism for by-elections, about which there has been much talk lately.  The Bill provides for the holding of a by-election in the event of the death or resignation of a member but does not set the timeframe for that by-election.  Surely, given the recent furore, it should be stated that in the event of a vacancy arising, a by-election should take place within a set period.

In the future, this election will be held on the same day as the European Parliament and local elections.  No by-election takes place in the case of a vacancy arising on local authorities as the party concerned nominates a successor and perhaps this mechanism could be used.  Alternatively, one could avail of the substitute list mechanism used in the European Parliament.  These are ways in which one can have a continuation rather than an absence in the event of a person dying or resigning in office.  This issue needs to be considered and freeing local authorities from the obligation to run a second or third election within a specific term would constitute a huge saving.I am very disappointed about an issue I discussed previously with the Minister, who stated he would address a point I had made.  This Bill is the first opportunity at which it could be addressed because it proposes to change the electoral laws.  At present, the rules regarding the supplementary register require those who had not noticed their absence from the register but who wish to be on it to go to a police station or to a local authority.  In the vast majority of working class areas, people simply could not be bothered.  The previous system was ideal, whereby in the run-up to an election and between the sign-off on the registers, a person could fill out a form.  If required, one could specify that such people would be obliged to produce photographic identification.  This is already contained in the Bill but if one wished, one could amend it to apply to everyone.  When they knock on doors, all candidates in any election will encounter someone who has not registered.  Given the extent of computerisation, it should be extremely easy to implement such a change and I urge the Minister to revert to the original method of operating the supplementary register.While I have much more to say on this Bill in respect of the failure to roll out proper local government structures, I will wait until Committee Stage.  Although Sinn Féin made a submission to the Minister's Green Paper on local government reform, some of its points are not reflected in this legislation, which therefore is a missed opportunity.

While one might ask what interest is it of mine, I am an elected representative from south County Tipperary and am interested both in the concept and its roll-out to other parts of the country.  Under this Bill, the mayor will have a range of substantial powers to establish and deliver a vision for Dublin.  The mayor's election, from a population base of 1.2 million, will also give him or her a unique mandate in Irish political life to act as leader and advocate for that electorate.  Under the new powers, the mayor will develop and oversee policy for the Dublin region in respect of land use planning, housing, waste management and water services.  The mayor also will have a strong role in transport and traffic management throughout the region.  The legislation will give the mayor the authority and powers to implement the policies the mayor and the revamped Dublin regional authority will lay down.  The mayor will also have a role in the annual budgetary process for the Dublin local authorities and will have the power to direct any of the four Dublin councils and their managers in respect of policy issues.  I consider this to be a fundamental part of the new Bill.  The mayor will also chair a powerful regional development board that will include major public sector, educational and enterprise interests from across the Dublin region.  It is vital to bring into sharper focus many of these organisations and to bring them into close proximity to work together in the interests of the public.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, stated that the mayor of Dublin will enhance local democratic leadership and civic engagement in the Dublin region and I certainly hope so.  He also noted the office will raise the profile of Dublin, nationally and internationally, and will assist local government in taking the initiative in Dublin to support local and national economic recovery and to drive and lead local development to hasten this recovery.  As Members are aware, this is very badly needed.  Dublin's business community has long pressed for the introduction of a directly elected mayor for precisely these reasons, as such groups represent the public who will pay the wages of both the mayor and all the officials.The introduction of a mayor will change the role of the city and county managers.  Powers such as the control of waste management, which several years ago were taken from councillors and given to the managers, will be returned to the mayor.  I am unsure whether that has worked out to the benefit of the public because at least elected representatives are obliged to revert to the electorate on a regular five-year basis as is laid down in law.  The mayor will be the head man or woman and this will be a new departure as up until now, the manager was the person who had the power in Irish local government.  Anyone in public life, whether in the countryside or in towns and cities, is well aware of this point and it will be important to strike a balance because the manager is often not answerable to the elected representatives.The mayor will have powers to draw up strategic plans in areas of land use planning, and therefore housing, waste management and water services for implementation at the local level.  The Dublin local authorities will be obliged to comply with these plans.  I note that when publishing details of this legislation last February, the Minister used the word "obliged".  Hopefully that will be the position and there will be no further delays.  The mayor will be supported by a more focused 16-member regional authority, reduced from the present number of 30 members.  Anyone who has sat on or chaired a county development board — as I did for a year — knows that a board of 30 members or more is completely unworkable, as it has too many members.  We have a huge board in the South Tipperary Development Company and it is leading to some difficulties.  Five of the 16 member authority will come from Dublin City Council and two each from the other three local authorities.  The remaining three seats will be filled ex officio by the Lord Mayor and the Cathaoirligh of the local authorities.We are told the introduction of the Mayor will not cost the taxpayer a single additional cent.  This is an interesting concept but I will believe it when I see it.  The introduction of the Dublin Mayor is occurring in concert with efficiency and saving measures being pursued across the local government sector arising from the report of the local government efficiency review group and related initiatives.  In Dublin alone, these savings are estimated at €40 million per annum.  I wonder where will the Croke Park agreement fit into this arrangement?  I question that seriously.  Has it been factored in?  The Croke Park agreement is an unworkable venture if we are to have any type of change. I do not say this lightly.

I love the word, "must" here.  I hope it happens.In the normal course, the Mayor will work in partnership with the Dublin local authorities, and the need to issue a direction is unlikely.  I wonder.  However, the Mayor will have the facility to do so should the need arise.  It is a pity Deputy O'Connor is not in the Chamber.  He said he is not interested in being Mayor.  I hope whoever gets the position will be a man or woman of courage, take these necessary decisions and fulfil his or her role in that area.The introduction of the Dublin Mayor is just one of many changes to local government, including the forthcoming White Paper on local government.  That reform is badly needed.  I spoke to the Minister this morning and I will have further meetings with him on the roll-out of elections for mayors or cathaoirligh in other towns and cities throughout the country.The Bill also provides for a review of the objectives and functions of the Dublin Regional Authority not later than two years after the authority has been set up.  I would say one year would be a more appropriate time.  The authority will be responsible for adopting plans proposed by the Mayor, but subject to a procedure which allows for mayoral adoption where the Mayor considers an inappropriate plan would be adopted, and it will oversee, advise and provide a forum for the Mayor to account for his or her actions.  The Mayor will, ultimately, account for his or her actions to the electorate every five years, which is very important.  This is unlike the situation of managers who are appointed and often re-appointed.In that regard, I pay tribute to Mr. Ned O'Connor, our manager in South Tipperary, who is about to retire next year.  He has given long and dedicated service to South Tipperary County Council and to the public.The new authority will provide a direct and ongoing institutional link between the major Dublin local authorities and the Mayor.  Joined-up thinking is a buzz-word but we badly need it.  This development will be useful.  We will watch closely to see if it happens, and I hope it will.  We are told anything is possible under the Croke Park agreement.  I am not talking about Tipperary beating Kilkenny in the All-Ireland hurling final, which we did.  We will be celebrating that tonight in the county, north and south.  We already have joined-up thinking in Tipperary.The authority will develop the Dublin region in a manner which contributes to environmental sustainability, economic progress, social cohesion and the cultural vitality of the region.  This will, at long last, give the ratepayers — mainly business people and property owners — some bang for their buck.  At the end of a period of office they can reject the first citizen if they are not happy with the situation.  Anyone who meets ratepayers on a daily basis knows they are not happy with the way their money is being spent.  In many cases the money is not spent efficiently, although it is hard-earned by business people, and is another added charge with which they cannot cope.  They do not mind paying charges if they are getting proper services, value for money and some appreciation of the effort they put in to earn the income to pay those rates.There must be a clear, transparent and user-friendly system embodied in the set-up of the new position.  The Mayor will promote the Dublin region efficiently and cleverly and to the benefit of society.  Other mayors will promote their respective regions in due course.The Mayor and regional authority will work closely with the four major Dublin local authorities in pursuing these objectives.  I wonder how this transition will work.  When I became a member of South Tipperary County Council in 1991, we had a county manager, a county engineer, a country secretary and a finance officer.  Now, we have a manager and six directors of services with whole teams around them.  We have become too bureaucratic and too much power is vested in these people.  Elected councillors, or Deputies, do not have a say.

I welcome that.  The new regional development board will bring together leaders in local government, commerce, education, enterprise and other key partners.  Ratepayers should be included, as key stakeholders.  The Mayor's mandate will give him or her the authority to hold these sectors to account in delivering for Dublin and, by extension, for other parts of the country.  That is vital.The staff of the Mayor's office will provide administrative support to the Mayor and the authority and will be composed of approximately 30 personnel.  A senior advisory team will be appointed directly by the Mayor for the duration of his or her tenure; the remainder of the office staff will consist of personnel seconded or transferred from Dublin local authorities, including the existing staff of the Dublin Regional Authority.I hope we will not have all chiefs and no indians and that there will be meaningful work for these people.  I am not knocking all public servants, but we need visionary staff.  I believe we need staff from the private sector.  I know the Mayor has the option of appointing some staff.  We need new thinking in local government.  We need visionary people and business ideas.  We need to motivate and stimulate and be the movers and shakers.  Business people must be supported.  Initiatives that come must be grasped and dealt with.  Those with initiative should be helped rather than met with layers of bureaucracy, sent from one agency to another and given no support until they leave when their enthusiasm and ideas have faded away.  I hope the office of the Mayor will be independent-minded.  It will certainly have to be independent of the managers of the Dublin local authorities.Last year's severe weather damage highlighted the challenges facing the Mayor of Dublin, or of any region.  The Mayor will set down the water services strategy to cater for the region's needs.  The Government is committed to capital support for these vital services.  I have questions here, as I have in my own county, about keeping the local contribution in line with Government investment in these chastened times.  The polluter pays principle and the water-in/water-out method of payment are hard and difficult on business people, the only people who are paying water rates.  Even businesses that are not operating are being issued with rate demands.  I also want the valuations office to be examined.  This is a national rather than a Mayoral issue but the method of assessing properties for valuation needs to be reviewed.The introduction of the Mayor will not cost the taxpayer a single additional cent.  The costs of the Mayor will be met entirely from within existing local government resources.  However, we know they are strained.  I do not believe the office of the Mayor will not cost a single cent.  It will cost money, but if stakeholders, including ratepayers, are involved and get value for money they will not mind it costing money.When the Bill was published earlier this year one of the criticisms made was that no discretionary budget will be available for the directly elected Mayor, making the role toothless.  This has raised doubts over how powerful will be the directly elected Mayor.      We must thrash that out and deal with it on Committee Stage to achieve clarity.  The new mayor of Dublin will not need his or her own budget but, because the four local authorities already have a combined budget of €1.5 billion, not counting capital expenditure of €1.5 billion, we know how many demands there will be on resources.  I live in the real world.  The local authorities will continue to use this fund to fund all operational activities but these activities will take place within the policy framework set out by the mayor.  When necessary, he or she will direct that the policy framework be followed.  I am sure the Dublin electorate will make a wise decision.  We need a very strong, independent thinker as mayor.  I wish that person the best in his or her role.Some members have drawn comparisons with the alleged superior budgetary powers of the Mayor of London.  We do not have to watch what the Mayor of London does and should be able to set our own course for our own capital city in this independent country.  This is very important.More clarity is required in respect of defining constituency boundaries.  More thought must be put into this and the boundaries should be aligned with the Garda divisional boundaries, HSE area boundaries and others so there will be no crisscrossing.  We need to be able to focus clearly.  Members of the electorate need to know where the boundaries are and will need to know whether they have a vote in the election of a directly elected mayor.The register of electors was mentioned.  It has been abused in some cases.  Perhaps the mayor of Dublin could advocate bringing the electoral registration system into the 21st century.  The current system is archaic, outdated and very expensive.  With modern technology, people should be able to register within days of an election and should be able to vote from abroad, as occurs in other countries.  I do not know why we cannot achieve this now.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is in charge of the e-voting machines.  I begged him to put the machines, whose storage costs a fortune, into use in the community.  The new mayor could take on a role in this regard.  The machines could be used in schools and community development projects rather than paying somebody to store them and, eventually, to destroy them.

I missed that.A constituent of mine who lives in Cashel quite close to Deputy Tom Hayes got two e-voting machines despite of my failure to get my hands on a machine for him.  He is a computer expert and has concluded that, with very few software changes, they could be adapted for any purpose in schools, community centres or resource centres.  I am engaging in robust debate with the Minister so as not to have the machines stored at enormous expense or, as I am now hearing, given back to the company that supplied them.  We should bear in mind that they were not fit for purpose on the first day.  I do not know what famous people, along with the Minister, made the decision to buy a pig in a poke.  I am now told the machines are to be given back to those who supplied them according to the contract.  I propose a meaningful use for the machines.  In this regard, the new mayor could show the leadership that is required and demanded by the public, especially the rate-paying public.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Government's, or Green Party's, proposal to have a mayor of Dublin.  Not being from Dublin, I am asked why I am so interested in this matter.  I am so interested because, over recent months, I have listened to the debate with interest as an outsider.  In a time of terrible economic crisis, the Government is wasting time and proposing to waste money on setting up an institution that represents another layer of bureaucracy and which will cost us a fortune.  Shame on the Government and anybody else who is proposing this at this time.I have no issue with Dublin people having a singular voice.  I have no issue with an area having its own mayor but the proposal before us is to add a layer of bureaucracy that will cost a considerable amount.  This is at a time when local authorities need to be reformed.  As with many other Members, I am a former member of a local authority.Only last year we had local elections that required us to listen to what the people had to say about local government.  In recent weeks and months, employees in local authorities have become frightened about their futures.  They do not know where their future lies.  There is a real crisis in local government and at local level in every county.  Very committed people are working in local authorities are not sure of their futures.  Newly-elected councillors are frustrated over their input into decision-making.  It is unfair that the voices of those who have devoted a lot of their time voluntarily to public service at local level for very little remuneration are not being heard.  Last year, the people voted in their masses to elect new councillors to local authorities.  They made their voice heard but their will cannot be acted upon because of the structures in local authorities.A very simple measure that would not cost anything is a proposal, to be put before this House and put into law, that would have a great influence on the way in which local authorities do their business.  It involves making the chairman of each local authority part of the management structure.  It is a disgrace that the chairman of a local authority cannot be part of the management team that meets weekly.  These teams comprise a county manager and the heads of each section.  No other board or organisation of which I know precludes the chairman from engaging in administrative duties.  It would not cost one shilling to address this and it would bring democracy back to local authorities.  If the Green Party were serious about giving a voice to the people who voted last June, the local authority chairmen, or mayors, would be part of the management structure.In this cash-strapped society, I appeal to the Green Party to cop itself on and listen to what its grassroots members and most Fianna Fáil members around Leinster House think of its proposal.  The latter believe they must vote for it because it is in the programme for Government but they actually believe it is ridiculous.  I ask people to be more honest.  At a time when we need every single shilling to be kept within the structures rather than wasting money, we are implementing a proposal that will involve great wastage and not help democracy in any way.There are many changes required in local authorities and many challenges to be met.There is a major opportunity for people to have an input into their local authorities and there are many ways in which we can change how business is done.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I move:That Dáil Éireann notes the Fifth Report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security entitled "Second Report on Climate Change Law", copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 13th October, 2010.I will begin with a quote from Kofi Annan who stated:Climate change is a silent human crisis.  Yet it is the greatest emerging humanitarian challenge of our time.  Already today it causes suffering to hundreds of millions of people, most of whom are not even aware that they are victims of climate change.These words remind us of the challenge that faces our global community.  The challenge to which I refer has been masked by the economic crisis, but climate change is a real and pressing danger.  It is caused by the developed world but it impacts most on the poorest of the poor.There is a compelling need to enact climate change legislation in Ireland.  Science informs us that global warming must be capped at 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels in order to avoid catastrophe.  Recently, EU Commissioner Connie Hedegaard issued a stark warning when she referred to the floods and mudslides affecting parts of the world, the extraordinary heatwave in Russia and the monsoon floods in Pakistan and Ladakh and stated that these extreme weather events either reflect climate change happening or are a foretaste of it.While our focus has naturally been on the economic crisis, we cannot afford to ignore the reality of climate change.  The recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, report shows a significant reduction in Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions due to the recession.  However, as the EPA's director, Dr. Mary Kelly, states:We need to use this opportunity to embed fundamental emission reductions in the economy in order to meet the very stringent EU 2020 limits and to move permanently to a low carbon economy.  We should not rely on a recession to meet our targets for the future.The only way to respond to Dr. Kelly's call is by enacting a climate change law.I thank the Government for providing time to debate this issue but talk is not enough.  It is clear that there is all-party agreement in favour of the Bill that is included in the joint committee's report.  It is worth noting that, despite repeated promises from the Government, it is the only legislation to be published in this area.  Time is running out, for both the Government and the planet.  I urge the Government to take the next logical step by adopting the Bill.  I make this call not only because the Bill has all-party support but also because it provides a robust, statutory basis for the Government, the Parliament and society in general to tackle climate change.I want to thank the Chairman, Deputy McGinley, and the members of the joint committee for their support and for their agreement in respect of the Bill to which I refer.  I also wish to thank Mr. Ger O'Donovan and Ms Claire Power who drafted this excellent and complex item of legislation.  I extend particular thanks to the organisations and individuals who critiqued our proposals along the way.We have heard a great deal with regard to the need for cross-party consensus in respect of the budget.  The Bill we have brought forward is proof that parties can work together on issues of global significance.  If the Government has the courage to adopt it, this would reflect a national determination to set Ireland on a new course in respect of climate change.Many promises have been made by both parties in government but we are still waiting for action.  In May 2008, the Taoiseach made clear his commitment to leading change in respect to how we interact with our environment.  He stated that we should no longer see the environment as something that limits our development.  In April of the same year, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, informed a Green Party convention:You all know that when we made that momentous decision to enter Government our primary motivation was a desire to tackle the defining issue of our age — climate change.On 7 October last, Senator Dan Boyle promised that a Bill would be cleared for publication within a fortnight.  However, we are still waiting.The Government is in its death throes and there is still no sign of a climate change law.  I do not underestimate the difficulties involved with drafting legislation in this area.  It is already clear that there are blockages within and between Departments.  The Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Finance and the Taoiseach are all being cited as creating obstructions.  The Cabinet sub-committee on climate change did not meet in the past 12 months.  The only meeting that was scheduled had to be cancelled as a result of what were termed "unresolved issues".  The Bill I am presenting on behalf of the joint committee is specifically designed to overcome turf wars and the silo mentality of Government Departments and ensure real co-operation between the latter.  It is vital that the Government delivers real co-operation as well as leadership otherwise its efforts will fail.The joint committee's report sets out a fully drafted Bill that builds on the previous report on climate change law.  The explanatory memorandum published by the joint committee in 2009 described the architecture needed to meet the challenge, namely, new institutional arrangements, more transparency, greater accountability and policy formulation.  The joint committee proposes that responsibility for ensuring our targets should rest with the Taoiseach.  This is a crucial distinction from other climate change legislation and is an important step forward.  As leader of Government, the Taoiseach has responsibility across all Departments and can literally hire or fire Ministers.  One of the great frustrations the joint committee has encountered is the lack of an integrated approach across the relevant Departments.  I refer here to the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and local Government, Transport, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.We have already seen, in the context of resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland, that an all-party approach is crucial, with the Taoiseach being accountable to the Dáil on a weekly basis.  That principle is embedded in the Bill that has been drafted by the joint committee.  The other provisions in the Bill are the setting of targets; the establishment of a climate change office in the Department of the Taoiseach, with staff drawn from the EPA and Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI; the setting up of an independent commission of experts on climate change; the establishment of a multi-annual carbon budget and a carbon dividend fund; the preparation of a national climate change strategy; and the introduction of an adaptation strategy.  The details relating to these provisions are contained in the joint committee's first report and the Bill is informed by a comparative assessment of legislation in other countries such as the US and Britain.One point that has continually arisen in the debate on climate change is the need for business to have certainty in respect of the targets that are set.  This matter certainly informed the debate on climate change legislation in Britain.  It is also clearly part of the debate in this country, a fact which I welcome.I welcome the statement by the Irish Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change promoting climate change law.  Investment in low carbon technologies means new jobs and commercial development.  The Bill provides business opportunities arising from that certainty.  In its submission to the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, it set out clearly the business perspective on the need for legislation.  It called for: "The Government to introduce a climate change law establishing a 2050 emissions target, carbon budgeting and a climate change commission, the Department of the Taoiseach to take overall responsibility for climate change policy."That is precisely what the Bill recommended in the report sets out to achieve.  This is further evidence of the importance of this Bill being adopted by the Government.  The group states further:Ireland can become a leading destination for green investment, innovation and enterprise.  We can replicate Ireland's past success in attracting investment and establishing global hubs in key sectors such as financial services, IT and pharma-chemical industries.  There are a range of opportunities for Ireland in this new era, from renewable energy to smart information and communication technologies to developing a sustainable agrifood industry.This is the business case to put Ireland on a new low carbon path.  We can create jobs and reduce emissions at the same time but we need a good statutory framework within which to make that transformation and that is what the Bill provides.  We need smart Government which is fit for purpose and has eliminated the red tape and lack of joined-up thinking that characterises so much of what we currently do in regard to climate change.This is not just about us.  Rather, it is about how we, as a global community, face the great challenge of our age.  In the same way that we rose to the task of creating a fair and peaceful agreement in Northern Ireland we need a united effort led from the top, driven from below and underpinned by legislation at home and internationally.  The Kenyan Nobel prize-winner Wangari Maathai said, "Climate change is life or death.  It is the new global battlefield.  It is being presented as if it is the problem of the developed world but it is the developed world that has precipitated global warming."I hope the Government will adopt a positive approach to the Bill.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has urged cross-party support and consensus building of late.  Here is his opportunity.  The publication of a climate change Bill is included in the programme for Government.  We have an all-party agreed, fully drafted Bill and it is now up to the Government to ensure the good work done by the Oireachtas committee does not go to waste.  The clock is ticking for Ireland and the rest of the world.I welcome the presence of the Minister of State in this debate.  He contributed to the joint committee before he became a Minister of State and was very positive in his approach to this Bill.  With no disrespect to him, I regret that a Cabinet Minister is not in the House because I understand that heads of a Bill will, it is to be hoped, be presented to the Cabinet next Tuesday.  It is essential that the issue is taken seriously by the Cabinet, which is where decisions are made.  We have had many promises and have made a big effort in the all-party committee which is the only body in this House that is currently functioning and focusing on climate change, a fact which I find extraordinary.A proposal came from the Green Party, for which I commend it, that there would be an all-party Oireachtas committee.  It has worked extremely well, first under the leadership of Deputy Barrett and now under Deputy McGinley, but there is nothing else.  The sub-committee barely met last year and has not met at all this year.  I appreciate that other issues are very pressing — nobody under-estimates that — but climate change will not go away.  If we bumble on hoping that things will work out or depend on the recession to keep our carbon emissions deflated that will not meet the challenge.This is an issue on which, it is to be hoped, there will be some global consensus but the fact that it is so difficult to create global consensus means there is a greater onus on us as one country to get our act together, provide the statutory framework and work together.  I am committed to working with the Government on this if it shows that it has really got the message, in terms of how we do this, and how we get over the problems of interdepartmental rivalries, fragmentation and bureaucracy, which is the continual complaint of people in the business sector, the NGO sector or at community level who are meeting the challenge in their own way and find Government is not able, equipped and fit for purpose.  That is what this Bill sets out to do and that is why I urge the Government to take it on and debate it on Second Stage.

This is particularly valuable in encouraging and building public support for strong climate change legislation.  I had the privilege of being on the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and would like to put on the record of the House the commitment Deputies such as Deputies McManus and Coveney have given to the committee over the past three years.  A cross-party approach is required if we are to get buy-in for the action required.In the past year the wider interest in climate change within the developed world has slipped to a significant degree.  Gone is the high profile that global warming had in the national and international media in the run up to the Copenhagen conference in December last year.  Gone are the compelling news stories and feature articles that appeared in the print media and the accessible and very effective documentary programmes on television.  Above all, I regret to say, that gone also is the general expectation of agreement on a new ground-breaking international treaty this year to succeed the Kyoto protocol.Within this vacuum, despite the overwhelming international scientific consensus and empirical evidence, we have seen the rise in the media of so-called climate change scepticism, which is clear proof if ever it was needed that complex and inconvenient truths are very often vulnerable to simple lies.  Why has that wider interest and attention slipped so dramatically?  Why are we not supposed to be as engaged on global warming matters now as we were this time last year?  What do we propose to do about it?  These are real and important questions and the joint committee's report serves as another timely and important reminder that the threat from climate change remains as great today as it was last year and the year before.Despite the current domestic and international economic problems, climate change is still the greatest medium and long-term challenge facing the world.  Earlier this year new data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies showed that 2009 was, despite an unreasonably cool winter in much of the northern hemisphere, the second warmest year globally since records began in 1880.  I heard Commissioner Hedegaard say she believes this year will be the warmest year we have had on record which, if it is true, is a very sobering fact.2009 was only a fraction of a degree cooler than 2005, the hottest year on record, and tied with a cluster of other years, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006 and 2007, as the second warmest year since record keeping began.  In other words, the past decade was the warmest decade ever recorded.  Globally, we have seen the impacts of climate change — massive flooding in countries such as Pakistan and unprecedented heat waves in Russia.  In Ireland, within the past year we have witnessed some of the most severe weather events ever experienced, including unprecedented flooding and cold spells, which have resulted in major economic and social costs.However, Ireland's geographic location currently insulates us to a large degree from the impacts of climate change.  Many millions of people, particularly poor people who contributed the least to the problems of climate change, are already coping with the impacts of global warming and bearing the brunt of its impacts.  One need only look at the state of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa to see that there is a real crisis which is no doubt influenced by the impacts of climate change.  Whether it be droughts, to increasing floods, to lower agricultural productivity or to more frequent and severe heat waves and storms, many rightly fear that matters will only get worse.Climate change is also a significant human rights issue.  As the former UN Commissioner and recent founder of the new Climate Justice Foundation, former President Mary Robinson, has stated in the past, the negative impacts on people of changes in climate do not always involve horrific headlines and images of hurricanes, floods or refugee camps.  More commonly, they will be cumulative and unspectacular.  Those who are already poor and vulnerable will continue to be disproportionately affected.  Carbon emissions from industrialised countries have human and environmental consequences.  As a result, global warming has already begun to affect the fulfilment of human rights, and to the extent that polluting greenhouse gases continue to be released by large industrial countries, the basic human rights of millions of the world's poor to life, security, food, health and shelter will continue to be violated.The urgency of mobilising an effective global response to climate change demands consensus at all levels, from local to wider international level.  Primary legislation is a hugely significant step in terms of underpinning our commitment and determination and cross-party consensus on key elements of the legislation will serve to reinforce that signal for stakeholders and observers.In seeking to keep a sharp focus on climate change in Ireland, we must aim to keep it above political point-scoring and tactics.  I am happy to respond to the motion on that basis and I look forward to hearing the other views across the House.There are two clear and understandable reasons the wider public interest and attention slipped so dramatically.  The first is the global economic downturn and the fall-out from the international banking crisis.  The immediacy of both the issues and the required responses have consumed attention around the world.  This fall-off in public interest may have created the impression that the climate change agenda has slipped in terms of priority and action but that is not the case as far as the Government is concerned.  While the economic situation may be dominating media interest, work on the climate change commitments in the programme for Government continues to be progressed as a matter of priority.I have heard it said that in these challenging economic times we cannot afford the green agenda.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If one looks at the new jobs that are being created in Ireland and the impetus and momentum internationally on new job creation, it is the green collar economy that will provide the jobs of the future.  I recently read Van Jones's book entitled "The Green Collar Economy", and we are already seeing much of what he describes in action here in Ireland.  Whether that be in renewable energy, the smarter travel programme, changes in the way in which we look at agriculture, there are strong signs that employment improvements are being found within the low-carbon sector.I would ask can we afford not to address climate change.  The Stern review prepared for the UK Government that forms the economic analysis for the UK Climate Change Act 2008 estimates that the cost of inaction on climate change significantly outweighs the expected cost of co-ordinated global action.  Without effort to tackle climate change, the review predicts that the loss of GDP from climate change could cost the global economy significantly more than the global cost of action to stabilise atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.Furthermore, such a view is hugely short-sighted and potentially damaging for a small open economy with a strong focus on high-end inward investment such as Ireland.  It also ignores Ireland's other major resource challenge — peak oil and Ireland's overwhelming dependence on imported fossil fuel energy.  Just this week the International Energy Agency published its annual World Energy Outlook.  It projects that crude oil prices will rise from €60 per barrel in 2009 to €113 per barrel in 2035 and oil demand will continue to grow steadily with all of the net growth in demand coming from non-OECD countries, almost half from China alone.  Addressing climate change and peak oil are two sides of the same coin.To have a sustainable economy, we must first have a sustainable environment.  There is now a widespread international consensus that the development of resource-efficient and green technologies will be the major economic driver of the 21st century.  As countries worldwide sought to boost their economies in the economic crisis through stimulus packages, there was a clear pattern of investment being directed towards infrastructure for less polluting transport modes, such as public transport, intelligent traffic management systems, low-carbon energy production, smart electricity grids and clean transport and energy-related research and development.  Clear signs of transition towards a low carbon economy are emerging across the world, with countries attracted to the greener option because of its potential to create large numbers of new jobs.  For example, while Europe was for a long time the world leader, the 2010 Renewable Energy Attractiveness Index now cites the US, and particularly those states with renewable portfolio standards, and China as the best investment opportunity for renewable energy.  The global green-technology sector is expected to grow at 10% per annum over the medium to long term.  In the context of securing national economic recovery, Ireland can ill afford to be left behind.Unless we face up to our environmental challenges, Ireland cannot hope to meet its economic objectives.  Climate change is the most significant environmental challenge facing us today — I would say it is the greatest challenge facing mankind — and urgent and decisive action is required if we are to avert its worst impacts.  We cannot afford to overlook or defer our own response and our role in supporting the case for agreement on a comprehensive global response.The second reason the wider focus has slipped is the outcome of the Copenhagen conference.  The heightened hopes and expectations of so many people were dashed by the failure of the process to deliver a legally-binding agreement that would trigger the comprehensive global response to climate change that is so urgently required.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I sat down with Mr. Yvo de Beor and discussed the reasons for the failure of Copenhagen.The Copenhagen Accord was a poor substitute for the anticipated new treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol.  In fairness, the accord contained some important provisions, particularly on the objective of limiting the increase in global average temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial levels and on financial support for developing countries.  However, it is not a legally binding instrument and its existence adds an extra layer of complexity and challenge to the international agenda.Let us look ahead to COP 16.  The immediate priority for the 194 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is to pursue a programme of work to ensure real and substantive progress at the 16th conference of the parties which will get underway later this month in Cancun, Mexico.  I hope there will be cross-party consensus that we can have representation at ministerial level in Mexico and I look forward to taking the matter further with the Opposition parties.I want to see a high level of ambition for the Cancun conference, a level much closer to that which the EU set for the Copenhagen conference last year.  However, I recognise the need for compromise in order to allow the process to recover from the disappointment of Copenhagen.  It is now widely recognised that a new international treaty cannot be finalised at Cancun but I believe the parties can, and must, re-invigorate the process and take a significant incremental step forward.  Such a step might constitute a set of decisions on key elements of the agenda that are already mature, and agreement on a programme of work to finalise a new treaty text as quickly as possible thereafter.That would establish a realistic prospect of a comprehensive agreement at the following conference in South Africa in 2011 but it would leave just one year to mobilise the new treaty in order to avoid a gap when the Kyoto Protocol expires in December 2012.

Through our own work — I have attended several Environment Councils in Europe — Ireland is at the fore with the other member states in pushing for international agreement as quickly as possible.  The answer lies in global transition and in a significant global step-change to set the world on a new low carbon path.  We have to look beyond the current economic downturn and plan to ensure that economic growth is environmentally sustainable in terms of carbon intensity, resource efficiency and climate resilience.  I see strong signs of this already happening in Ireland.  There are good news stories out there at present.  As Deputies Coveney and McManus know, our renewable generation of electricity is approximately 15%, which is the second highest in Europe.  This is a real change that has been made in a few short years.  The US Secretary of Energy, Stephen Chu, was here last week and he was looking at how Ireland has been able to achieve such important success in such a short time.We need legislation but we also need regulation and change in Government policy.  Much of that change in policy is happening.  In agriculture there is the quality assurance scheme for Irish meat and the UK-based Carbon Trust is involved in measuring the carbon production of Irish meat.  This is a good news story in comparison to other forms of cultivation.  In the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government there are changes in building regulations and in the Department of Transport in the changes in taxation measures on new vehicles.  These are significant changes that are happening here and now.Yes, we need legislation and we are on the cusp of the heads of the Bill being presented to the Oireachtas.  It will be groundbreaking legislation and we intend to get it right.  The legislative proposal under development will go beyond ensuring compliance with our EU and wider international commitments.  The Green Party in Government is determined to ensure the legislation enacted will not only enshrine the policies and principles to reflect the core national objective of playing a real and progressive role in the global fight against climate change, but will also act as a driver towards achieving a more sustainable future across all sectors of society in Ireland.  It is my intention that the Government Bill will be both innovative and inspirational, and I look forward to a frank and honest public debate in both Houses and with all stakeholders when further details are announced shortly.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Liz McManus; she and her team have put a huge amount of work into putting together not only a framework document for a climate change Bill but also a Bill itself, and this is what we are debating today.  I was in Copenhagen last year, as was the Minister of State, and he will know there is now understanding among all political parties of the responsibility of mainstream parties, large and small, to play their part in ensuring climate change as an issue and a challenge remains central to a government policy regardless of who is in government.  It is unfortunate that despite the fact that prior to the conference in Copenhagen last year we spoke about the need for the Government to produce a climate change Bill, or at least a draft Bill, to try to improve Ireland's credibility and negotiation position as an EU member, we still have not seen that legislation a year later.  I do not want to introduce a party political negative element to this debate because that has not been the spirit of it so far——
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	573	True.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	574	—— but it would have been unlikely that we would have seen a climate change Bill or a draft Bill next week if it had not been for the consistent and determined work of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security to force the Government to publish something.  That is unfortunate.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, it is also unfortunate that we do not have either of the two senior Green Party Ministers present for the debate.  To have a Cabinet Member present making commitments on behalf of the Cabinet and the Government would have been helpful in adding credibility to what is being said by Government parties.I am sure many people in Ireland today, if they were listening to the debate this afternoon or were reading what we are debating, would ask themselves what climate change has to do with the enormous challenges that Ireland faces now.  It is a more difficult challenge for us, but an equally important one, to convince the public, business people, people who find themselves out of work and people struggling financially that carbon emissions and the problems they create are still relevant to the running of Ireland in the midst of an economic, employment and fiscal crisis.  I say to these people that this is the case.  I am conscious of the fact that parties such as mine, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil have more of a responsibility, as so-called mainstream large parties, to sell this message than does perhaps the Green Party, with respect, because people already know and understand its views in this area.A number of people state the last thing we need now is Green Party policy and that we need to get back to building a mainstream economy.  This thought process misses the point.  The reality is that the future of the Irish economy will not be built on doing what we did successfully in the past.  Building roads, houses, hotels and factories will not solve Ireland's problems.  What we need to build in Ireland is a new economy, built on clever thinking, efficiency, telecommunications and all of the technologies that will provide employment in the future to provide incomes for families in Ireland.  We need to change our education system to prepare for this.  The so-called "green agenda" sold by the Green Party is a much bigger issue than Green Party politics; it is mainstream politics and involves a mainstream economy.  Anybody who thinks the Irish economy can progress and ignore the opportunities of which we can take advantage in this crisis is very naive.What this debate and Bill is about is saying to people that we want, on an all-party basis, to commit future governments to a consistent and determined course of action which will fundamentally change the way in which the Irish economy functions, the way in which Irish people and Irish families operate and live, the way in which we move around, the way in which we produce food, and the way in which we communicate with each other.  All of these have an impact on our environment and on the energy that provides for our lifestyles.I take the point about the need for regulation and for persuasion on the need to change lifestyle, but ultimately what is required is certainty.  One cannot rely on regulation and persuasion without a requirement to deliver on targets set down in law because we all know how politics works.  When times get tough the easy decisions are taken, the easy cutbacks are made, and the invisible savings that are often the most calamitous in terms of their long-term impact are the soft options taken by Government.  We need to cut expenditure and raise taxes to the tune of approximately €15 billion over the next four years.  After this the challenge will continue.  It is in this context we must ensure climate change and all of the issues and responsibilities around it are more than a feature — that they are a central plank in any Government's future overall economic strategy.  I was sceptical at the start of this process about the need for climate change law.  I thought that if governments do not meet their targets there was not much we could do about it, such as putting them in jail, for instance.  However, I have changed my view completely.  Our Bill proposes a legal obligation on the Taoiseach to set targets, to ensure that his Government meets those targets.  We are asking any future Taoisigh to continue to do this by setting five-year carbon budgets and meeting legal obligations.  This sends a strong signal to those who want to invest in the Irish economy, to invest in renewable energy, one of the few areas with significant private investment capital and gives such people certainty that the political and economic direction being taken by Ireland is consistent with their interests.  If the climate change challenge is to be linked with economic recovery and job creation in law, this will give certainty to investors.Unless the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has changed his mind, there is still a difference of opinion as to how to deal with climate change law.  I know there are reservations within the Green Party about giving the primary responsibility to the office of the Taoiseach.  I suspect the Government view will be that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, or a Minister for climate change, will be a climate change champion to win the arguments in Cabinet, set targets and make things happen.  This may well work, depending on the personalities around the Cabinet table but it may well not work if the Minister with responsibility for this area is not sufficiently persuasive or powerful if a Taoiseach dismisses this argument.I am in agreement with my colleague, Deputy McManus, who has been very good on this issue, that the ultimate responsibility needs to lie with the head of Government.  This is the main issue in this legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to make the arguments that have been agreed in the all-party Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  The appropriate politician in Ireland to set down the ground rules and the targets, the performance indicators, is the Taoiseach, supported by an independent commission and by an office for climate change and energy security within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This means the leader of Government, who is a member of a mainstream political party, with credibility outside niche environmental sectors will decide the policy as to what makes economic sense for Ireland in the face of the economic challenges over the next four to five years and also for the next 40 and 50 years.  I also agree with the target set in the draft legislation of an 80% lower emissions figure by 2050 from a base year figure of 1990.I hope we make progress in certain aspects as a result of today's debate.  I hope we can give a message to the Government that any legislation needs to be supported by all political parties in this House because the likely scenario is that at some stage in the next 12 months there will be a new Government.  I am not arrogant enough to say who will be in this Government.We are passing legislation in a very unusual way.  For the first time in my political experience — with the possible exception of Northern Ireland issues — we are trying to put together legislation which all parties will buy into and will support if in Government in the future.  We are trying to put a new institutional framework in place that can survive different parties in Government with different agendas, priorities and ideology over the next 40 years.  It is regrettable that the Government has decided to adopt the tactic that it will not accept a draft Bill from the all-party committee which it could change and amend but instead has decided to produce its own Bill.  I hope the Government will take the elements of this Bill which it can live with and produce a Bill that mirrors what the committee and the rapporteur in particular has tried to do over the past 12 months.  No political party and no Minister has a monopoly of wisdom on this issue.  We should not try to play politics nor look for recognition or thanks for being the first to introduce a climate change Bill.  For the first time in our history we should aim for Government and Opposition, collectively, putting together legislation which all future Governments will be able to implement.

It is an important demonstration that this issue must have cross-party agreement because the legislation will need to be used by a number of future Governments, regardless of whether they serve their full time.  This is how climate change needs to be addressed and it is very heartening that we have such awareness in this House at this time.  Based on my recent membership of the committee it is encouraging to see the proactive nature of the contributions of those who have presented evidence, covering matters such as the economic effects of the high price of oil and gas, the business opportunities in the smart economy, the technological issues that Siemens covered recently and afforestation that Coillte discussed yesterday.  All of this highlights that this is not an easy area in which to introduce legislation.  It needs to take account of a number of economic factors as well as potential and therefore it needs to be broad as well as long term.  I hope it will result in a fair hearing because by its nature it needs to take on board a number of sometimes quite competing interests.  However, we need to distinguish between the people who, as the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, said, clearly articulate the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and those who come from a business as usual point of view.  Some of those people are very powerful, which makes it all the more difficult to get one's scientifically-based evidence across.  Because of the economic crisis, it does not allow for the — I was going to say luxury — necessity of a full debate, on which we need to focus.There are good examples of countries that are embracing the changes.  We are embracing them in terms of our own measures in the smart economy, retrofitting of housing, renewable energy developments and better planning.  However, there are good examples including Güssing in Austria, Våxjö in Sweden and Freiburg in Germany.  In addition, Sweden has a national target of moving beyond oil by 2020.  Those are the kinds of measures that highlight that to be competitive the resistance to change has to give way to a necessity to change in Government, the public service and all the political points of view in this House, which is not easy because change is particularly painful from an economic point of view.I welcome that we will have the announcement of the Government's Bill, which is long overdue and which comes as a result of considerable debate between Departments and a wide range of sometimes competing interests.  Credit is due to the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security for keeping the pressure on.  I believe we will have a legally binding requirement to plan CO2 reductions for the first time, which is a breakthrough.  At a time when we need to increase employment and meet our needs, we also need to move beyond a fossil-fuel economy, which will be to everybody’s advantage and enhance the competitive status of the country.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I thank Deputy Sargent for sharing time.  I commend the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security on its excellent work in producing its Bill.  It is heartening that Members from all parties worked together constructively on an issue of not only national but also global importance.  It would be nice to see the same sense of working towards the common good extended to other policy areas.The Bill produced by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security has assigned responsibility for co-ordinating and enforcing action on climate change to the Department of the Taoiseach.  While I understand the reasoning behind this, as explained by the committee, I am not sure that the Department of the Taoiseach is the most appropriate office to drive such reform.  However, I agree that rather than responsibility being spread out among various Ministers and Departments, there should be a more centralised point of responsibility.  I welcome the proposal to establish an office of climate change and renewable energy, and a climate change commission.The current economic difficulties are not surprisingly the most pressing concern to every Member of this House and the public.  However, the interlinked issues of climate change and energy security are without doubt among the most pressing global issues of our time.  As a country we must work to reduce our emissions across every sector and play our part in ensuring security for future generations.  The impact of global warming was witnessed at first hand last year when we had an unprecedented amount of rainfall resulting in devastation for countless families across the country.  Rather than it being a freak event, experts at the time attributed it to the very real impact of climate change.  The devastation of last year's rainfall drove home the need for real action on this issue.  Last month it was reported that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions had fallen for the first time in 20 years.  A number of factors contributed to this, including, primarily, the recession.  However, I have no doubt that measures taken to improve our efficiency have also contributed to this reduction.  Despite this dramatic reduction, Ireland's emissions are still 10% above our Kyoto target.  While I understand the work on the Government's climate change Bill is well advanced, I call for the heads of the Bill to be published as soon as possible.  This issue is simply too important to be delayed any longer and I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the legislation proceeds at speed.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	585	It is ironic that even on one of its core principles, the need to address climate change, the Green Party will have achieved little in its period in government.  It will point perhaps to the carbon tax that was introduced last year but as I pointed out at the time, it was merely another excuse to impose a new tax and had no impact on measures or programmes to address carbon emissions.  A carbon tax if it is to work effectively should be revenue neutral whereas the measure introduced here was simply another means to increase revenue and in common with most of the other measures implemented, has fallen disproportionately on people who are already feeling the impact of the current austerity programme.  Indeed it has been argued by experts in the field that an effective carbon tax, one that would reduce the use of carbon fuels would also reduce the amount of revenue from that source as logically if it was a success, then the use of transport using carbon fuels would fall.The Green Party may claim that its introduction fulfilled part of its commitment to having the Government implement measures to protect the environment and to attain the ambitious targets set for the reduction in CO2 emissions, but there is little in it that will tackle the real underlying causes.  Instead it has imposed an added burden in terms of taxation and will in no way help to change patterns of transport and overall fuel use.For example, nothing in the manner in which it has been implemented will encourage people to use public transport rather than cars.  It has been pointed out by people involved in the bus transport sector that if the Government was serious about encouraging a significant modal shift, it would not have imposed this tax on buses.The other issue is that the tax has increased the level of fuel poverty.  Taxes on domestic users of fuel, along with increases in the prices charged for electricity and gas, have significantly added to the cost of energy for households.  Increasing numbers of people are unable to pay their bills or keep their homes adequately heated.  This also leads to health problems and an increased burden on the health services, apart altogether from the impact on the households and individuals affected.My comments may appear to diverge from the subject of this report and the proposed Bill but I make no apologies for raising the immediate consequences of introducing a carbon tax as a so-called climate protection measure at a time when ordinary people are being attacked on all sides.  Pious gestures toward climate change count for little when the parties proposing them are sharpening their knives for an unprecedented attack on the lives of the ordinary people of this State.I am pleased that the proposed Bill sets out fuel poverty as one of the issues to be taken into consideration when framing an overall strategy to deal with the issue of climate change.  Among the other factors referred to in the section on carbon budgeting are the likely effects on the overall economy and economic competitiveness.  It is a sign of the times that such issues are taken into consideration.  During the economic boom they were rarely referred to in the debates on tackling climate change but the downturn means immediate economic factors are far more important and need to be taken into account.Serious issues must be addressed.  The level of carbon emissions needs to be reduced.  Under the Kyoto Protocol, this State is committed to preventing CO2 emissions from rising more than 13% above their 1990 levels.  Currently, they are over 20% above the agreed target.  Not only does that leave us in breach of our international obligations, it also makes us liable to annual fines of up to €180 million.  The proposed Bill sets a target for a reduction of 80% below 1990 levels.  Kyoto marked only the first step in tackling global warming.  Experts estimate that CO2 emissions must be reduced by between 80% and 90% by 2050 if run-away climate change is to be avoided.  That is reflected in the targets set in the Bill.  Not only have we a moral obligation to future generations to prevent global warming, but it also makes economic sense.  The general consensus is that it is cheaper to take the necessary measures to deal with the challenges presented by climate change now rather than deal with the consequences later.Climate change is not the only reason to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  We are still heavily dependent on oil supplies that may become more difficult to access and are concentrated in a number of politically unstable nations.  A considerable amount of oil remains in the ground but it is getting harder to find and more expensive to extract.  We also realised a few years ago when Russia threatened to restrict gas supplies to Europe that energy supplies are susceptible to political uncertainty and even blackmail.  We could have addressed some of the problems of supply ourselves had we developed a proper energy and exploration policy for the oil and gas off our own coasts.  Instead, however, we choose to abandon all pretence of a State strategy and handed our resources to companies on terms that are the most generous on the planet.The problem of climate change must be approached in a positive manner so that moving away from older manufacturing systems based on the heavy use of carbon fuels is not seen as an barrier to economic growth but an opportunity to boost the use of newer and cleaner technologies that do not present the same threat to the environment and which are more sustainable both in terms of the environment and future economic growth.  The key to this change will be greater utilisation of renewable energy sources, which will not only have radical implications for the industrial economy but also for agriculture.  There is potential for greatly increased production of energy crops and entirely new economic sectors based around the production of energy from the wind and sea.I note that the proposed Bill recommends the establishment of a body with responsibility for renewable energy.  We certainly need a more proactive strategy to promote the development of renewable sources such as wind and wave power.  A number of projects have been initiated around the country but it appears the impetus behind many of them has fallen victim to the recession and a lack of imagination on the part of the Government.  Not only would such projects help to address the immediate issues of replacing harmful fuels but they would also contribute significantly to employment and growth.It is important that the recession is not used as an excuse by some developed industrialised countries to renege on their pledges under the Kyoto Protocol to assist developing countries in their efforts to combat the effects of climate change and limit their emissions as their economies grow.  This is causing a major political rift between rich and poor states in the United Nations.  Less than $1 billion of the $18 billion in adaptation aid pledged by rich countries had been delivered by the time of the Copenhagen summit.  According to the UN, between $50 billion and $70 billion needs to be invested annually to help poor countries adapt to extreme floods and droughts.What happens here may matter little at the global level if the major world economies are not prepared to do what is required in order to address these issues.  However, we have to do something and the Bill sets out several useful proposals on framing an overall strategy.  It appears to cover all the key areas that would need to be taken into account in framing such a strategy and it references appropriate knowledge and the likely impacts on the overall economy and society.  It is important that regular assessments are made of the targets so that further provisions can be made where they are unlikely to be attained.  That has been one of the key failings in this and related areas of renewable energy production and domestic bio-fuel production capacity.In regard to the latter, it is ironic that later today we will discuss the scam pulled by Greencore in destroying the last vestiges of the Irish sugar industry.  Deputies from the Green Party as well as my own party spoke about that scam, whereby Greencore was given a State asset for a nominal fee.  The asset was used for personal gain by Liam Carroll and others associated with Greencore.I visited Carlow seven months ago and I am glad to say people there have formed a committee to restore sugar beet processing for the production of either sugar or ethanol.  Unfortunately, the buildings that Greencore stole from the taxpayers of this country were demolished, with the notable exception of the tower.  I suggest that the purpose of leaving the tower in place is because it will dictate the skyline in any future application for planning permission.  Over the years, the processing facilities in Mallow, Thurles and Tuam have all been closed.  A fantastic indigenous industry which served this country for more than 80 years has been abandoned.I hope the strategy being proposed today will be implemented in full.  Sinn Féin will support any policy that addresses the issues affecting our environment and, in particular, that guarantees clean energy security.  Yesterday, we heard a presentation from Spirit of Ireland, which is encouraging in so far as it offers opportunities for five western counties to create jobs and contribute to the national energy grid.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I am delighted to support the motion before the House, which seeks acceptance of the climate change Bill that has been proposed by the all-party committee.  I know the Government has produced its own Bill.  It does not matter which Bill is considered as long as one of them becomes law.  It is important that a Bill is brought before the House so that we have a framework in place and strategies and plans to implement it.We have been talking about climate change for 20 years.  Over the years, many cynics have denied the existence of climate change.  Nowadays, there is universal acceptance of the reality of climate change.  If urgent action is not taken, it will be cataclysmic for the world at large.  It would probably wipe out many countries.  One way or another, climate change will change the world as we know it.  All the assumptions we have made and taken for granted about world economy will have to be reconsidered.I do not think the Government has been serious about climate change in recent years.  The Kyoto Protocol was accepted in principle, but no real effort was made to comply with any of its targets.  The target for Ireland was to limit its increase in emissions to 13% of the 1990 baseline.  This target was completely ignored during the Celtic tiger years, with the result that emissions grew almost exponentially.  Ironically, the recession has done for emissions what the Government failed to do.  It now seems we might comply with the 2013 target, entirely as a result of the reduction in economic activity and the consequent decrease in emissions.The Kyoto targets have now been superseded by EU targets.  We have given a commitment that by 2020, we will have reduced our dependence on fossil fuels by 90% and will be generating a third of our energy needs from renewable resources.  Anyone who knows anything about the current situation will understand how difficult it will be to achieve such a significant target.  It is meaningless to set such targets in the absence of strategies and plans.  I know from listening to officials from State bodies and Departments talking about the targets they set each year that the output statements which are produced at the end of each year rarely bear any resemblance to the targets set at the start of the year.  They change the target for the following year.  The target cannot be changed in this case.  Our targets will not be met unless we have a clear strategy and framework and a plan to implement them.We cannot rely on the recession to look after climate change for us.  Our climate change policies should be robust and should transcend good or bad economic times.  In short, we have to change the way we produce and use energy.  I appreciate that there is conflict between many competing interests, as Deputy Sargent said.  There is conflict between environmental costs and energy costs at the early stages.  Fine Gael believes that Ireland's natural resources, if properly harnessed, could not only make Ireland less dependent on imported fuel and give us much needed fuel security, but could also make Ireland an exporter of energy.  We should aspire to achieve that as the perfect long-term solution to our energy problems.  It makes environmental and economic sense to do so as quickly as possible.Fine Gael's NewERA document outlines our proposals for investing in renewable energy.  If that is to happen, it is absolutely essential that the second interconnector is finished as quickly as possible.  We should start to plan a third interconnector so that we can buy and sell energy.  It would allow us to export excess energy.  In addition, it would allow us to access foreign-produced energy when there is a reduction in wind or wave energy, or any other intermittent form of energy.Regardless of the merits of the carbon credits system in the early days, when we were trying to get acceptance of the reality of the climate change crisis, its day has passed.  It is no longer an acceptable way of meeting our commitments.  It does not mitigate climate change — it simply allows countries to salve their consciences.  In some cases, the system of allocating credits inhibits efforts to switch to more environmentally friendly and sustainable practices.  Even worse, more often than not it is done at the expense of poorer Third World countries that are trying to develop their economies, while allowing us to remain profligate.  Its day has gone.Mitigating or arresting climate change can be achieved only if there is total government buy-in to the idea of changing consumption patterns and production methods.  We do not have the right regulatory framework at present.  We do not have the grid, or the right system for gaining access to the grid.  On the production side, much has been said about the great position we are in on the periphery of Europe.  It is often suggested that we have a unique advantage in producing wave and wind energy.  However, when one compares Ireland to the least suitable countries in terms of wind, for instance, our record is woeful.  People seem to think we are doing well, but we are woeful when compared to other countries.The political will to drive, facilitate and foster these industries on the kind of scale that is required simply does not exist.  Innovative companies that sought to capitalise on our indigenous potential were driven out of the country in sheer frustration as their efforts were thwarted at every turn.  The Government of the day failed to give the kind of leadership and implement the kind of regulatory framework that would have allowed such companies to continue to produce and create jobs in Ireland.  The tragedy is that such companies are now building wind farms in other countries, thereby assuring their future sustainability and their jobs.  Once again, Ireland is losing out.Biomass is potentially a partial solution to our energy needs.  Our damp climate and rich soil is ideally suited to biomass.  The Fine Gael policy in this area involves a marriage of effort between Coillte and Bord na Móna.  A collaborative effort is needed to sustain indigenous jobs, to reduce imports and to decrease our carbon footprint.  If we are serious about tackling climate change and reducing our carbon footprint for the sake of future generations, we must grasp the nettle and not merely continue to pay lip service to the notion of sustainability.The ordinary members of the public who use energy — domestic householders and those involved in industry — can make a  huge difference on the demand side.  There is great goodwill to save the environment and change our patterns of behaviour, partly because of the increasing cost of energy but primarily because there is widespread recognition of the damage fossil fuels and greenhouse gases are doing to our planet.  The role of the Government is to help us to change our ways and to incentivise and facilitate change.  I do not refer merely to the imposition of carbon levies.  I accept they have a role, but they are not the whole story and cannot be expected to achieve miracles.We need meaningful retrofitting of our older building stock.  Homes that were built as recently as ten years ago are woefully wasteful of energy and hugely expensive for occupants.  Such investment during the Celtic tiger years would have been far preferable to the kind of building that took place.  It is not too late, however.  We need to expand the current installation schemes, which are valuable.  We need to introduce something much more comprehensive.  Schemes of this nature should be much more accessible.  We need to vary them and make them more flexible so that they meet the varying needs and pockets of people.  We need to expand them if we are to make a difference to our housing stock, which will be with us for another 100 or 200 years.Huge benefits could be achieved in the public transport sector.  We need to try to get people to make a modal switch from the car to public transport.  The relatively small investment that was made in public transport showed the willingness of the public to embrace public transport and make that switch.  People see public transport as socially, economically and environmentally preferable.  As we see throughout the country, including in our cities, the absolute tragedy is that buses are being taken off the roads and people are being forced back into their cars.  If the Government is really serious about bringing in a Bill and trying to change public behaviour, it will invest in public transport.  I know the economy is on its knees.  There is a tendency to see a Bill like this as irrelevant, or as a luxury we cannot afford.  I suggest it is precisely what we need if we are to invest in a sustainable future.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate and to comment on the climate change Bill the Government should have brought before us.  With the shadow of a terrible recession over us, some people suggest that the last thing we should worry about is climate change, emissions and so on because we have a pile of other problems.  That is not right and it would be foolish for the Government or its successor to turn its back on policies that would mean a major change in the way we do the business, think and invest.As Deputy Mitchell stated, it is difficult to get ordinary people excited at the moment about this subject, which is close to the Minister of State's heart.  Even in good times, it was difficult to get this issue across.  I come from a rural background but it is hugely important for where I come from that the climate change strategy be successful.  It should be handled in a straightforward and sensible way in order that there will be no daft things done that will cause some sectors of the community to be saddled with unjustified and unnecessary costs.I have a great interest in climate change.  The only time people get overly excited about the issue is when there is a huge spike in the cost of petrol and diesel at the pumps or if there is the slightest talk of a scarcity of oil.  Everyone then starts talking about alternative fuels but the day the pump runs dry on me in Mountbellew is not the day to talk about what could be done as an alternative because a huge lead-in period is needed to address this issue.  If one wants to change a culture, one has to do it in many ways.  The overall corporate image has to change and great leadership, particularly political leadership, is needed to get the citizens of a country like ours to genuinely believe that their best interests are served by clean fuels, lower emissions and so on.  They do not see that as being of practical financial use to them at the moment.Fossil fuels, which we import, were cheap.  The problem now is the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps is creeping up every month.  It was €1.30 a litre yesterday when I was filling my car.  It is not long since it was €1.25 a litre and it is only a few months since it was €1.18 a litre.  Most people would not notice the cost of petrol and diesel as long as they could get a fill and get on with their work.  However, there was a huge spike in the price to €1.50 a litre two years ago and when that happens, alternative energy supplies become hugely important.  We need to get down to business to put alternatives in place.There are always great debates about what agricultural land should be used for throughout the world.  Most people suggest it is a farmer's job to grow food to feed the world and that is basically what we do.  The problem about this is that for many years, because of market distortions of one description or another in Europe and elsewhere, there were occasions when we had to pay people to keep their land idle.  In other words, it suited better that farmers did not sow anything on their land for a few years and this is known as the famous set aside system.  That could hardly be right even in the context of this debate.  If that land could be used to grow biomass corps such as willow to replace expensive fossil fuels, we would not need half the €6 billion worth of oil we import and that would make a significant difference to our balance of payments.  The problem is I am not sure whether the Government or another government will be able to catch on to this.As a farmer, I will commit my land to a crop that gives me a profit the same as someone who wants to open a supermarket.  If one thinks one is going to make money on it, that is what one is there for.  Great strides were made and the incentives were reasonably good but the problem is there was a break in the chain and we have a number of processors who have tonnes of product but they are unable to shift it.  In other words, there has been a breakdown in the link between them and the market.  I do not know who is to blame for that because I do not know enough about it.  The processors could give me a contract to grow willow, for instance, but I am not sure I will get paid for it when I deliver to them and, in turn, they will not pay me unless they are sure they can get it to the market.  That chain is broken.  If the Minister of State wants to give this process a good name, he had better get over this bottleneck in the system.There are many aspects to climate change.  I am not one of those who buys into the idea because I live in the middle of an area hit by the worst floods I ever saw this time last year.  I have never seen water so deep but then I was told by OPW officials that one can only expect a flood of that severity every 200 years.  I do not know how sure they can be it will be another 200 years because some of the rivers are extraordinarily high today.  However, we watch reports of earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and so on, and I do not know whether it is because they are all beamed into our homes around the world, which did not happen 50 years ago, that our knowledge is greater.  However, I have not been convinced by anybody who says anything that has happened had happened before.  I do not subscribe to that view and that is no reason to fail to address climate change.  We have a huge economic reason to go down this road from the point of view of sustainability.  The economics of the future will be dictated by how smart and green we become but there is a job of work that needs to be done and the Government does not appear to be delivering on it.It is not all bad news.  I am impressed by the warmer homes scheme.

Very few houses were built, even in the past three or four years, that have the type of insulation that would prevent heat escaping.  For every joule of heat per cubic metre that is lost, it must be replaced by expensive fossil fuel, and we know where that will lead us.I am disappointed there are not more people who want to speak on this subject today as it is of huge importance.  Why will the Government not introduce a Bill and initiate a debate on this matter among the people?

A debate has been organised on this issue up until 3.30 p.m. but it is Opposition Deputies who have to keep it going.  This raises a general issue of how the Oireachtas is viewed by the people.  I always defend the Oireachtas when general issues are raised about it and about politics and our political system, but we now have what is known as the "empty chamber syndrome".  It is not unique to Ireland; it happens in other parliaments.  Often the fault lies on the Government side.  A good proportion of Opposition Deputies would be present for various debates and the empty seats tend to be on the Government benches.  We need to work on this on a cross-party basis.

If Deputy Gogarty speaks on the motion, at least that will have been a response to the point I made, but we all need to work together on this issue.  The work we do is important and valuable and we must work together to do our best to make what the Oireachtas does look good from the public point of view.  It is important that the Government does its bit in that regard.The proposed Bill included in the report is an all-party one, agreed by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  I commend the work of Deputy McManus, the people who helped to draft the Bill, including Claire Power and all members of the committee on their initiative in preparing it.  We talk of having a better functioning Oireachtas but we need to ensure it is not only the Government that takes the initiative in introducing a Bill and that Bills could be introduced by the Opposition, whether on a an all-party basis or not, and supported in moving forward through the system.  A great deal of work was put into the preparation of this Bill and it was done on an all-party basis rather than Government driven.  It was a great initiative.  It would be welcome if the Government could adopt it, but if it does not do so and it decides to introduce its own Bill, I hope it will work with the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security to reach as good a compromise as possible on the proposed legislation and that it will accept amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies and Government backbenchers.Our level of emissions has fallen because of the recession.  We do not know for how many more years that will be the trend but, hopefully, it will not continue for too long.  The issues, which the proposed legislation attempts to address, will emerge again in the future and once our economy picks up we will face the same type of challenge we faced before our economy started to take a downward turn.  This legislation is as important now as it was three years ago.  It is not the case that because the climate change debate is not as high on the agenda that it is not important to pass the proposed legislation.  The reasons for its introduction have been given, namely, that it would provide certainty, it would put addressing climate change on the agenda and make it clear that it is a priority of the Oireachtas, the Government and the Taoiseach.  A mechanism is included in the Bill to make the Taoiseach responsible, the objective of which is to ensure that addressing climate change is a cross-departmental, cross-sector challenge.  There is a danger of climate change becoming marginalised.  It is important, therefore, it is addressed on that basis.  All Departments have a influence in how we deal with climate change.When the proposed Bill, or a similar one is passed, another issue to be considered, which I would bring to the attention of climate change lobbyists, is that much of the language around climate change is, by nature, technical and remote, including all the detail relating to targets, emissions, trading schemes, carbon offsets and carbon credits.  It is remote from the way people live their daily lives in their communities.  This debate is slightly offputting, as are many political debates.  All the talk of bond markets is a big turnoff.  People wonder what all this language means when they hear it discussed on radio and television.  People need to know what the impact of climate change will mean for them in terms of flooding and other developments.  Language is an issue in this debate.We have all the targets, which would be set out in the proposed Bill, together with all the procedures, processes and offices that have been set up, but if we want to solve the problems posed by climate change, it comes down to the small practical steps that can be taken in local communities by local government, Dublin Bus, CIE or whoever.  It translates down to the small practical things people can do.  Such measures would energise people about this issue, rather than talk of targets.  Despite all the lobbying and petitions, this debate has not filtered out in the public domain, which is largely due to the way this issue is discussed, which makes it a remote from people.Local government has an extremely important role to play in tackling the issue of climate change.  It could intervene in terms of projects.  It is involved in planning and it can play a role in local enterprise.  When legislation is introduced, we must not forget that this issue is about leadership being shown by the Oireachtas and the Government. The report refers to a bottom-up approach.  This is the most important approach because it relates to the practical things that people can do to address the issue of climate change.  It is not only about reducing emissions because there is a recession or signing a document on the dotted line but about putting in place measures such as a local wind farm, a project involving a local school to encourage parents to walk with their children to school to reduce the use of cars, or a rural public transport system.  Many different initiatives could be taken.The idea of green jobs is important, as is the way in which we can combine addressing climate change with economic growth to ensure we have cleaner growth for the future.  How can we make sure our economic growth is not out of kilter with our ambitions for the environment and addressing climate change?  The phrase "green jobs" has been put forward but people do not really spell out what such jobs would involve or they may not know what they will involve in practice.  It is an issue to which we need to give much more thought.  Green jobs are talked about as if they relate only to the construction and waste management sectors but we need to focus on the scientific area as in the invention of products, say, to help conserve energy and to help our economic growth and the development of start up enterprises around such projects.  We need to give more consideration to the areas of research and development we need to promote.  Development in this area is not only about wind energy.  It is important to involve all stakeholders in this process and that includes local communities, voluntary groups and so on.As I have said previously, substantial research has found that societies with more income equality do better in their performance in terms of the environment, among many other areas.  Measures taken to better organise society to address climate change should also have as their objective not only to avoid exacerbating inequality of income but to secure greater equality of income.  Such an approach would create a better society.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Liz McManus, who, during my period as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, championed the need for legislation on climate change.  Thanks to her work as rapporteur to the joint committee, we produced a report on the issue and were subsequently assured that the Government would introduce legislation on climate change.  We asked that our report and the views expressed to the joint committee be taken into account when it was being drawn up but, lo and behold, nothing happened.  Deputy McManus is to be congratulated on producing climate change legislation.I welcome the decision to establish the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and pay tribute to the work it has done.  It was a great honour to serve as its first Chairman.  Unfortunately, as with everything else in this House, good intentions were quickly abandoned and the joint committee came to be viewed as a nuisance, as a body that interfered, as it were, with the Executive.The Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security also produced an offshore renewable energy development Bill.  Published in November 2008, the Bill introduced new ideas on how the massive potential of the offshore renewable energy sector could be developed through structures for planning and zoning in areas of our seas that are suitable for offshore renewable energy development.While a great deal of work was done on the Bill, two years later it is gathering dust.  We first submitted it to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as this appeared to be a reasonable course of action and I am sure the Bill is still somewhere in the Department.  The joint committee was informed, however, that legislation in this area was a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and that our Bill would be examined.When one hears this one becomes despondent.  It is no wonder members of the public question what the Oireachtas is doing when we establish committees before proceeding to ignore them.  The Order Paper is full of reports waiting to be debated.  Good work is being done by Members of both Houses who have gone to much trouble and done considerable research to produce reports.  As with everything else unless a report emanates from the Government, it may as well not exist.Dáil reform has been promised.  I have cited one example of legislation that secured all-party agreement.  If I were a Minister, I would grab the opportunity provided by a committee reaching all-party agreement on a Bill.  I would go to the committee with my ideas and work with it to produce legislation.  I would not be afraid that my position would be undermined because a Bill was produced with input from a committee.  It appears that unless something is produced by a Department, it cannot be right.  The current approach reflects an attitude of "What would a committee know?"While debates of this type may help fill the day's business, they are a waste of time unless action is taken.  The Government has been in power since 2007.  Green Party involvement in it created a great deal of hope that it would exert influence in this area.  I would be the first to state that the Minister of State opposite me, Deputy Cuffe, played an important part in the early deliberations of the joint committee.  Why go to the trouble of establishing committees if one is not prepared to use them or devote time to debating the reports they produce?All the work produced by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security was properly researched with professional advice and following submissions from members of the public.  This is the ideal way to prepare legislation as opposed to the current approach whereby the Executive produces a Bill, Second Stage is taken in the Chamber and the Bill is then sent down to the bowels of LH2000 for Committee Stage where two men and a dog, if dogs were allowed entry, examine it.  In the meantime, one has a file full of representations from various interest groups seeking amendments that would avoid certain outcomes.  A select committee then fights to have amendments introduced.  However, amendments tabled by the Opposition are ignored because only Government amendments are accepted.  These are the facts.All the Minister needed to do in the case of the legislation we proposed was to produce heads of a Bill, ask the committee to examine it, invite members of the public to submit suggestions, have the committee report back within one month or six weeks and then draft the detail of the Bill, taking into consideration the various ideas that have been expressed.  Such a Bill would pass through the House quickly because few amendments would be tabled on Committee Stage given that outside bodies would be part of the process from the outset.Climate change and energy security are too important to ignore.  Unless we address energy security and generation, we will be forced to fight a permanent battle to deal with CO2 emissions.  Ireland has tremendous potential to benefit from clean, renewable energy.  We should be a world leader in research in this area.  Engineers should be trained on how to service wind turbines.  Many ideas have been presented but we have not done anything about them.  We are standing still and talking while everyone else acts.  That is a terrible shame.Not one of the buses serving Dublin runs on alternative fuel.  On a visit to Sweden, we found that every bus features the slogan "Powered by Renewable Energy".  What example are we showing in public transport?  Years ago, we asked the Minister to ensure public transport providers and local authorities led by example by using renewable energy to power their vehicles.  Here, too, nothing was done.In my current position as Fine Gael Party spokesperson on foreign affairs, I realise the importance of climate change for developing countries.  Millions of people are being shifted from one part of the world to another because the impact of climate change, whether constant flooding or drought, is making life unsustainable.  At a time when the population is growing and the supply of water diminishing, people in Ireland are washing their cars with drinking water.  What example are we setting?  As soon as one raises the prospect of water metering there is an outcry from those who state they will not pay for water.  We assume water will continue flowing every day.  While people should not be required to pay for what they would normally use, excess water usage should be paid for.  We should also raise awareness of the importance of water conservation.We must lead by example by switching off machines and lights when they are not in use.  How many times have Deputies leaving the House seen lights left on in Government Buildings, yet we lecture others about the importance of switching off lights?  If everyone did the little things, their combined actions would add up to one big thing.  The issue is one of awareness.  This is not about wearing sandals and having a ponytail.  Climate change affects everybody, not only the select few who campaign on the issue.Each individual must be made aware of the importance of energy, the way in which it is or could be produced, the inward investment renewable energy could attract and the jobs that could be created, the need to conserve water, solar power and so forth.  One could dwell on this subject indefinitely but the Government must give a lead.  If the Government does not have time to so do, it should take up the good work being done by this joint committee and other committees on which people are spending much effort and time.  Although Deputy McManus is a member of a different political party, she and many other members of the joint committee have shown great commitment to this issue and they deserve respect.  The Government should not think that legislation can be ignored simply because someone else produced it.  Moreover, it should not give false promises that a Bill will be published within six months, only for it not to materialise.  What legislation from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is being debated at present?  Members are debating a Bill about a mayor for Dublin at a time when there already are four mayors in Dublin.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I understand that €100 million has been committed over three years by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, to assist poorer countries to tackle climate change.  Consequently, either the Minister, when responding to this debate, or someone from the Government side should indicate the current status of this initiative to Members.The content of the Bill has already been anticipated in the joint committee's report.  Members often speak in this House about the partisan nature of politics and I agree it is understandable that in certain circumstances, the House will divide on political or philosophical issues or on managerial issues pertaining to how the country should proceed.  However, an issue such as this, on which a cross-party report has been produced that has been accepted by all political stakeholders and with the Green Party in power, should surely be out of the starting blocks already.  At this point, Members should not only be talking about heads of agreement and so on.There is a sense that because the economy has taken such a downturn, an issue such as climate change can move to the back burner.  I reiterate a point made by Deputy Barrett by questioning the reason the election of a mayor for Dublin is being prioritised through changes in legislation.  Why does that measure take greater precedence than an issue such as climate change in the legislative programme before Members?I refer to today's Order of Business in the Dáil and the furore, partly started by me I admit, on the decision by the European Court of Auditors to critique a Government decision on the closure of the Irish sugar industry.  While one may ask the reason this is pertinent to the subject under discussion, I was town mayor of Mallow at the time when the sugar factory there closed and one issue I sought to put on the political agenda was an examination of the potential for ethanol production.  It was considered that if Ireland was moving out of sugar production and if the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries were going to be given a greater slice of the market under the Everything But Arms initiative, then this was a WTO decision to which one would, to a certain extent, be obliged to buy in to.  At that time, I was strongly of the opinion, based on sound advice, that there was potential at least for a survival mechanism for the plant for two years.  Thereafter, once the market had opened up, it would be a case of sink or swim depending on how the global market went.  It is now evident that the global market for sugar has increased but in the absence of the continuation of sugar production at the Mallow plant there could have been a move towards an ethanol production facility.Timing is everything because this year, the House has transposed the bio-fuels obligation legislation, which seeks to ensure that each tank of petrol has ethanol or alternative fuel sources as part of its constituent composition.  The Labour Party strongly believed that stimulation of an ethanol production market within Ireland was possible but to be able to so do it would be necessary to put in place a set of tariffs.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, rejected this position.  I am not trying to score political points because if I understand his position correctly, he wished to go back to ascertain what would be the Commission position on such a proposal.  Members opposite will correct me if I am wrong in that assessment.  Nevertheless, there is a precedent in respect of ethanol importation as I understand that other countries are placing a tariff on importation to stimulate local production within their countries.I represent the constituency of Cork East, within which is located the Whitegate refinery.  I am reliably informed that for a number of years, the big oil companies operating at Whitegate have been storing up undenatured ethanol that more than likely has been imported from third countries such as Brazil.  While it is probably derived from former forestry sites, Ireland has not even started localised production.In respect of climate change, I refer to the attempt to wean ourselves off petrol and to substitute it with alternative energy sources.  One does not do this by allowing big oil companies to control the political agenda, thereby enabling them to meet their obligations under the bio-fuel obligation scheme by imports from locations such as South America because that does not make any sense.  At that time, when Members were doing battle on this Bill, I would have thought the Minister, Deputy Ryan, would have been ahead of the curve.  I would have expected him to play, dare I say it, the green jersey card by asserting that Ireland would stimulate local demand.  This comes back full circle to my point about Irish sugar and how, at a time when Ireland is importing substitute ethanol to put in its cars, it could have an ethanol industry that could provide the same service.  This is where political thinking in Ireland has become so disjointed.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	610	That is right.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	611	We must begin to think more laterally about how to achieve our aims.  We must start by ascertaining where we want to go and what is our target.  Thereafter, we should look towards achieving that target without fear of being perceived to be too nationalistic.  I do not use the word "nationalistic" in the narrow sense by which most people define it.  I mean having some pride in our ability to produce such ethanol ourselves to be able to stimulate local production.  This could then offset many of the challenges Ireland faces vis-à-vis the production of carbon resulting from the importation of substitutes.On the issue of forestry, the stated Government target in the revised programme for Government is to achieve 10,000 hectares per annum.  At present, I understand that approximately 7,000 hectares is being achieved, therefore, Ireland still is off-target.  Forestry is a productive indigenous sector that has a multiplier into the local economy.There is a justification, even in these constrained economic times, for continuing the subsidisation of that sector.  If, for instance, a Government can justify the subsidisation of foreign direct investment type jobs, whereby a grant or subsidy is given to a company for each job created, the same logic can apply where we seek to upscale indigenous sectors.  If we are to target climate change, forestry will become a fulcrum in terms of achieving targets.With the impending budget, I ask the Government to take a look at this again.  Funding this sector will create an economic multiplier that will assist local economies.  I ask the Government to bear that in mind.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important matter.  I compliment Deputy Liz McManus on the good work she has been doing as rapporteur of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and on producing this report.It is not good enough that this is how legislation originates in the House.  This legislation was promised by the Government, which is now in its fourth year.  Climate change legislation was always seen as one of the priorities of the Green Party.  One would have thought this legislation would have been enacted by now.  It is not good enough to see a Minister of State in the House for this debate.  There is no sign of a Cabinet Minister.  One other Green Party Deputy has spoken and two Government Deputies shared time.  That is the total contribution on the Government side.  What sort of commitment is that to a debate on the steps we should take and how we should fulfil our commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and to European targets, which is one of the most important discussions we could have?Ireland is best placed, throughout the entire European Union, to develop renewable fuels.  Yesterday, I heard a presentation from a group of businessmen who proposed a €3.5 billion project which would be worth €16 billion to the economy.  They have already negotiated with the British Government to sell it electricity.  A number of projects of this nature are eminently viable and should be put in place very quickly.  In the short space of a couple of decades, we could be a net exporter of energy to the United Kingdom and the Continent.  This is a massive but viable project.  It would benefit those parts of the country that have been looking out for investment and development and have high levels of emigration.The Government should have put this issue at the forefront and legislated for it.  I have listened to Deputy Liz McManus, week in and week out, raising this issue on the Order of Business and asking where is the Government's promised climate Bill and why it is not yet on the stocks.  I hope the Minister of State takes the message from this debate that it will be a sad reflection on the Government if it comes to an end without putting a climate Bill in place, especially as the Green Party is a coalition partner.I urge the Government to take the proposed Bill as it is and present it to the Oireachtas as a Government Bill.  There is precedence for Opposition Bills being taken.  This is an all-party Bill that has been agreed in committee.  No one should feel bad about accepting it, especially as the Government does not have its own Bill and there is no sign of one coming at present.  It is promised but not here. Perhaps, at the end of this debate, the Government will give a commitment that that will happen.Tackling climate change is the biggest challenge of our age.  We are probably the biggest importer of fossil fuel energy in Europe.  We are aware, therefore, of the carbon input to our environment.  Ireland has made international commitments, which we have not lived up to.  The Kyoto Protocol commits Ireland to remaining 13% above 1990 levels but recent figures show us to be 25.5% above 1990 levels, even allowing for the current recession.  The reduction we have achieved is simply because of the recession.  It is not because of actions we have taken to reduce our carbon emissions.Good intentions are not enough.  We require a robust framework that will translate aspirations into action.  It needs to be driven from the top in a co-ordinated and integrated fashion and it needs to be grounded in legislation.  That is what the proposed climate change Bill is all about.  The Government must take up the challenge and support the Bill.This is about taking our responsibilities seriously but it is also about opening up opportunities for innovation and job creation in new technologies that can harness nature's resources in order to safeguard the future of our world.  We cannot opt out of dealing with climate change.  We have been living in the carbon equivalent of a property bubble in this country.  Ireland is the fifth highest emitter per capita of greenhouse gases in the world and the second highest in the European Union.  Each citizen here is responsible for emitting 17 tonnes of greenhouse gases per annum, up from 15 tonnes per annum in 1990.  Rather than making progress we are still going in the wrong direction.Politically, everyone has signed up to the need to address climate change.  There is now a broad scientific consensus that we need to prevent temperatures from rising by more than 2% above the pre-industrial level.  International experts, the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the Stern report on climate change have called for reductions in carbon emissions of 80% by 2050.  This Bill puts in place a framework and mechanism for reaching that target.Figures presented by various people working in this area show that we can be net exporters of renewable energy well before 2050.  That would be an incredible target, rather than simply reducing emissions by 80%.  Let 80% be the standard for other countries but let us take the initiative.The Bill sets a national objective of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 along with an interim target of 20% by 2020, with a transparent compliance system and regular reporting.  The targets are in line with what the science demands if we are to avert the catastrophic effects of climate change.  However, we can do better than that.Until now, there has been no legislative mechanism by which to achieve or monitor our climate change targets.  This Bill makes the Taoiseach accountable for these targets.  The Taoiseach will set the carbon budget and targets, report to the Oireachtas and outline the proposals and policies for meeting them.  Other provisions in the Bill include: the establishment of a climate change office in the Department of the Taoiseach with staff drawn from the Environmental Protection Agency and Sustainable Energy Ireland; an independent commission of experts in climate change; the establishment of a multi-annual carbon budget and a carbon dividend fund; and the preparation of a national climate change strategy and adaptation strategy.On the international level, it is the poorest countries that contribute least to the problem of climate change.  These are the ones that are now bearing the brunt of its impact.  In this Bill, we have addressed the international social justice aspects of climate change by including a provision to implement greenhouse gas reduction projects in developing countries.  Here in Ireland, the poorest and those already suffering from fuel poverty must be protected and this is also taken into account in the Bill.There is so much we can do.  This measure is at the centre of Ireland's future economic activity and at the cutting edge of new technology.  It should be acted upon regardless of the circumstances, bearing in mind that fossil fuels, which are damaging the climate, environment and world, must be dealt with.  We have a mechanism before us for dealing with this matter that is beneficial to both the environment and economy.It is obvious that this issue should be addressed.  If we do not show leadership by introducing overarching structures and development principles and giving direction, our approach will be all over the place.  We do not need an ad hoc response.  This matter is so important that we need Government leadership.  The Oireachtas is all about showing direction in respect of something that is eminently desirable.  We cannot be leading from behind or waiting.  We must not expect somebody else to act or leave the matter to the private or other sector.  The problem must be dealt with in a proper, organised fashion, with the proper context and framework.  That is what legislation is all about.  It is not about interference but about providing a framework that will maximise the approach to dealing with renewables and alternatives to fossil fuels, which are predominant throughout most of the world.We must do what we have always been trying to do and what we have been discussing every day in this House, that is, create more jobs, revive the economy and get out of the recession.  These matters are all related but we are waiting for the initiative to be taken in this House and for the Government, which has a strong green component, to ensure it is taken as quickly as possible.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	613	When we adjourned this debate yesterday, I was half way through my contribution.  The Bill is to be welcomed because, for the first time, vocational education committees, VECs, are to become mainstream in the provision of primary education.  There are seven primary education patrons but now the VECs are to comprise an eighth.  I welcome this because the VECs represent the only part of education that has a democratic basis and in which directly elected councillors are involved in the delivery of education.  VEC education is linked to the local authorities.  Councillors from those local authorities are represented on all the VECs nationally.  They have an input into what is effectively community education.VEC education is exclusively at second level at present.  It used to cover third level education, including education provided by the institutes of technology.  I used to be chairman of Bolton Street and Cathal Brugha Street institutes of education.The VECs have done a fantastic job, particularly in difficult times, and have been incredibly innovative.  They introduced the post-leaving certificate courses and provided flexibility in an otherwise very inflexible second level education system.  The VECs widened the boundaries and parameters and increased the flexibility in education.  Particularly in times of recession, when graduates find it difficult to get jobs, there is a tremendous number of courses available in VECs nationally, which courses have both an educational and training element.  The courses are provided very cheaply and are fantastically beneficial.Very recently we noted that graduates of the Ballyfermot post-leaving certificate course in animation received Oscars in Hollywood.  Those concerned developed this initiative from scratch and linked up with Disney and some other providers and now comprise one of the mainstream providers of animation, not just for education but also for film.I hate to see the Government proposing to impose a €500 fee for post-leaving certificate courses.  This would be very regressive.  Every encouragement should be afforded to those who wish to remain in education but who do not want to attend mainstream third level institutions and to those claiming the jobseeker's allowance.  Such courses increase one's chances of obtaining a job.  Training is of benefit in terms of obtaining apprenticeships.The VECs have proved to be a very effective mechanism within the parameters in which they have been allowed to operate.  There is no reason they should not be part and parcel of the primary education system.  However, as I stated, I am not happy with any system of education that develops on an ad hoc basis.  The VECs are to participate in primary level education not specifically because they wanted to or because somebody decided it was desirable but because other patrons were not providing the services required.  They have been interested in education for a long time but have not been allowed into the system.  There is an ad hoc approach at present.  When considering patronage in the primary system, one needs to look right across the board.  One must consider the effectiveness of the existing patrons and how the new and old systems can be integrated.It will be quite difficult for the VECs to have an effective input.  While they will have the right to establish and maintain schools and to be patrons thereof, their involvement is being limited very strongly in the legislation.  The schools already run by VECs have democratic involvement in that councillors are on the boards of all the schools.  By and large, councillors are chairmen of the boards of all the schools at second level.  However, under the legislation, there is no provision for this system to continue.With the halving of the number of VECs, from 33 to 16, certain areas and counties will have no VEC provision at all.  It will be difficult to find people.  Will other members of the committees be nominated?  Will the VEC simply appoint its two representatives?  Will it be able to appoint the teachers' representatives or community representatives?The legislation must clarify, in a much better way, how the VECs are going to operate as patrons.  It must indicate who will be the members of boards of management and how the latter will operate.  It must also indicate from where the chairpersons will come.  What is proposed is completely at odds with how the VECs operate at present.  This is an ad hoc mechanism and I would like the matter to be dealt with, through consultation, in a much more effective fashion.What is proposed in respect of the employment of unregistered and unqualified teachers represents a mistake.  As with other items of legislation, the provision in this regard appears to be an afterthought.  Section 12 — the final section in the Bill — provides for the amendment of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 to allow for the employment, in certain exceptional and limited circumstances, of persons who are not registered teachers under the Act.  Someone, either inside or outside the Department, suggested the inclusion of this section.  I do not know from where it came but it is not an integral part of the legislation.  Last year, some 50,000 unqualified teachers were used in the primary education system.  The inclusion of section 12 means that the employment of such teachers will be placed on a statutory basis.  In other words, the Tánaiste is encouraging the use of unqualified and unregistered teachers.  That is not good enough, particularly in the current climate.Many teachers are unemployed and are very anxious to obtain employment.  By placing the employment of unqualified and unregistered teachers on a statutory footing — not just in emergency circumstances — the Tánaiste is delivering a kick in the teeth to those who put themselves through third level, obtained their qualifications, underwent training, etc.  If what I have outlined comes to pass, much greater numbers of unqualified individuals will be employed in our schools.I ask the Tánaiste — even at this late stage — to reconsider the position because what is proposed is unsatisfactory.  The INTO is up in arms in respect of this matter.  The latter lobbied strongly in respect of the establishment of the Teaching Council and worked hard to ensure that the qualifications obtained by those in the teaching profession are as good, if not better, than those which can be obtained anywhere else in the world.  Teachers in this country possess very good professional qualifications and receive great training.  However, the Tánaiste is now making statutory provision to allow those who do not possess such qualifications to teach in our schools.  That is a contradiction in terms and what is proposed cannot be allowed to happen.  It is strange that the Tánaiste will not make provision in respect of the large numbers of are unemployed and who are desperately seeking work.  What I have outlined represents the sting in the tail of the legislation.On Tuesday night last, I visited a gaelscoil in Cabra which has been operating out of prefabs for the past 15 years.  The meeting I attended was held in one of the prefabs, which was very smelly and damp.  The classrooms in this school are too hot in summer and too cold, wet and damp in winter.  That has been the position for 15 years.  An entire generation of children has gone through the school and has moved on through second and third level.  These individuals are now in employment.  The Government has not seen fit to confer permanent status on the school, which has been viable from the outset.  This is despite the fact that the previous Taoiseach was in power for much of the period.There are encouraging signs that this matter may soon be resolved.  It has been stated that this matter had fallen through the floorboards and the Department of Education and Skills admitted that the application relating to the school went missing for four years.  There is a fault there somewhere.  It is going to be difficult to proceed to build the school on the current site.What is needed in respect of the provision of schools is the putting in place of a programme under which permanent status will be granted to all of those schools which do not possess and which are housed in prefabs.  Deputy Quinn has argued strongly in favour of this on numerous occasions.  There is a need for parents, boards of management, staff, etc., to be involved in the design of new school buildings in order that the latter might be used, outside the course of the normal school day, for other purposes by communities.  This did not happen in the past.  This is because the Department seems to use particular templates in respect of the design and construction of new schools.I welcome the Bill to some extent.  However, I believe it to be flawed.  The Tánaiste will be obliged to introduce a considerable number of amendments on Committee Stage before  it can be considered viable.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton.This Bill represents a missed opportunity.  I wish to take up the point Deputy Costello made at length in respect of the provisions which will enable unqualified teachers to be paid out of the public purse.  However, I will first comment on the real missed opportunity to which I refer, namely, the opportunity of encouraging greater democracy in the area of education.  This is the Bill's great weakness.Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 refers to the employment of a registered teacher and states:A person who is employed as a teacher in a recognised school but—(a) is not a registered teacher, or(b) is removed or suspended from the register under Part 5,shall not be remunerated by the school in respect of his or her employment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.Section 12 of the Bill enables unqualified teachers to be paid out of the public purse, which is absurd.  What is proposed clearly highlights the fact that the Government is out of touch.  Anyone with experience of the education system will be aware that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of qualified teachers who are either being forced to emigrate or being obliged to scamper around the country — from Malin Head to Mizen Head and from Donegal to Dublin and on to Cork — in search of a week's teaching work here and there.  These people are posting thousands of CVs to every school in the country.  However, it is proposed in the Bill that the provisions of the Teaching Council Act 2001 be repealed in order that schools will be able to pay unqualified staff out of the public purse.I accept that such staff will only be employed in certain circumstances and that schools will be required to furnish evidence to the Minister for Education and Skills that they have been unable to employ registered teachers.  Are we expected to believe that when, at 7.30 a.m. on a Monday, the principal of a school in Macroom, County Cork, receives a telephone call from a member of staff indicating that he or she is sick and will not be able to attend for work, that said principal will, in turn, be obliged to telephone the Minister to seek permission to employ an unqualified teacher for the day?The Bill offered a real opportunity to involve VECs in a democratic system by means of establishing a regional structure.  Under such a structure, a centre could be put in place which schools requiring staff on a temporary basis — perhaps for one, two or three days — could contact.  Are we expected to believe that the principal of a school is going to telephone the Department of Education and Skills on the morning on which an emergency arises——

That is absurd and it is a real betrayal of the investment the State and taxpayers have made in training qualified teachers.  Those to whom I refer are desperate to find work in order that they might get on the first step of the ladder towards obtaining a permanent teaching post.  These individuals are obliged to take a day's work here, there or anywhere they can get it throughout the country.  That is also absurd and is sufficient reason for the House to reject the Bill.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	618	There was a real opportunity in this Bill for greater democracy in education.  If we were starting out with a blank sheet of paper today what system would the Minister of State put in place to serve the educational needs of the country?  It would not necessarily be the VEC system but it has one cornerstone which is critical to education and is missing in a lot of other areas of the education system and the service that is delivered, that is, democracy.  There should be a democratic education system which is not beholden to parents, patrons or teachers but which is accountable democratically.There was a real opportunity to deal with many of the ills of education in this Bill and put in place a real democratic structure which would provide for diversity in education and be accountable.  It would deal with the kind of issue to which I referred.  Something sneaked in under the carpet to facilitate paying, from the public purse, unqualified and retired teachers in receipt of a pension who are taking jobs from young people who are signing on.  It is absurd and I ask the Minister of State to go back to the drawing board, withdraw the section and provide a regional structure whereby teachers can be contacted on Monday or Tuesday morning at an early hour to inform them that a teacher is needed in Clondrohid national school or wherever else and that service can be delivered locally.

The capital spending on it will be protected over the full lifetime of the project.  The total estimated cost of the development, including the ambulatory and urgent care centre at Tallaght, is €650 million.  This is €100 million less than a previous estimate because of the fall in building prices.Of the total cost, €400 million is committed by the Exchequer and is reflected in the HSE's capital plan this year.  This will be increased to a figure of €450 million in the HSE's capital plan for 2011.  A total of €25 million has already been spent on the planning, design and support of the project since 2007.  The balance will be met from philanthropic initiatives, estimated at €110 million, and from commercial and other sources of some €90 million.  The commercial and other sources include a car park, commercial units, research funding, private clinics, universities and medical schools.  One of the functions of the national paediatric hospital development board is to pursue philanthropic sources of funding.  It is working intensively on this issue.The development board is making good progress in planning and developing the new hospital at the Mater site.  It has formally asked An Bord Pleanála for the project to be considered under the strategic infrastructure legislation and had an initial meeting with An Bord Pleanála on 5 November 2010.  Subject to planning permission being granted, construction of the new hospital is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2011 with completion of construction scheduled for the end of 2014.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	620	In the current economic climate to think that we will raise €110 million through philanthropy borders on the unbelievable.  I need not remind the House of what is happening on the bond markets and the difficulty the country would have had to raise funds which, thankfully, it does not have to do at the moment.  There is great concern on this side of the House about the resignation of the chairman, Mr. Philip Lynch.  Is it correct to say that the cost of digitalising record-keeping in the hospital has been underestimated and may not be sanctioned by the Department of Finance?  A figure of €150 million has been mentioned.  The Minister said she has had a meeting with An Bord Pleanála but when can we realistically expect to get a decision on whether planning has been granted on the site?  They are the key questions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	621	I detect the negative tone of the Deputy in the questions.  The philanthropic contribution is highly achievable.  The new person has a terrific track record in philanthropy.  A foundation has been established and has received charitable status from the Revenue Commissioners.  The year before last Toronto hospital raised $78 million.  I visited the Starship Children's Hospital in New Zealand which receives huge philanthropic contributions.  It is not unusual and I and many others believe the contribution expected to be raised over a four-year period, that is, €110 million, is highly achievable.  There have already been indications from individuals of their interest in this area.Technology it is part of the HSE's wider technology system.  Routers, switches and so on will go in as part of the capital construction but technology will be part of the HSE's ICT spend over the next three years and will be a large part of the capital plan next year and in future.  What the Deputy suggested is not true.  A number of people try to find every single negative that they possibly can about the hospital.Mr. Brian Fitzgerald, the financial controller of St. James's Hospital, is currently working with the two of the three children's hospitals which will be coming together, Temple Street and Crumlin, on their enterprise and resource planning.  As part of that they will be examining the SAP or Oracle systems and that will then transfer over to the new children's hospital.  It is estimated the ICT spend at the hospital will be in the region of €60 million.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	625	If it is a strategic infrastructure project the purpose of the legislation was to reduce the timeframe for getting planning permission.  The idea is that the construction of the project would begin at the end of next year.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	626	We will not expect any planning permission until the end of 2011.  That is useful.  New Zealand is not Ireland in 2010 or 2011. The Jack and Jill Foundation, one of the most successful charitable organisations in the country, has had to resort to seeking additional funding from the HSE because it failed to meet its targets in its philanthropic endeavours, and the people concerned are realists.  We want realism not fantasy.  Does the Minister really believe it is possible to raise €90 million from commercial enterprises based on a car park, which parents have been told they will be allowed free use of, and a coffee shop?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	627	Yes, and I have been strongly advised that consultants' private rooms and so on will also be involved.  It is realistic.  I remember answering questions in this House a year ago about whether the funding arrangement we put in place for the cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's Hospital was realistic; of course it was and it was bankable.  Manchester spent 40 years bickering about a site.  It then took nine years to decide on a preferred site and four years to build it.  If one talks to the people of Manchester from all the different components of the three hospitals involved everybody was totally happy that the right decision was made and I believe that is what we need to do here.  I hope to have the Deputy's support.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The report into the Roscommon case was published by the HSE on 27  October 2010.  The HSE stated it is committed to learning from this and other reports to ensure that services are strengthened to help protect children to the greatest extent possible.  The HSE has already provided me with an update on the actions it intends to undertake in regard to 56 of the recommendations of the report that fall within its remit.It is the case that some recommendations made following previous inquiries were also made in the Roscommon inquiry.  I am giving consideration to putting in place a mechanism to ensure that all recommendations are implemented nationally.  The HSE has commissioned an independent consultant to carry out an audit of neglect cases.  This process has already started in Roscommon and will then be carried out in Waterford and in an area in south Dublin.  A full national audit will be carried out based on the lessons learned from these initial audits.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	629	Some 50 recommendations were made, all of which were very sensible and, as the Minister of State said, some of which were made before in other instances.  Can the Minister of State tell me how many recommendations have been implemented?  One is the introduction of a national common assessment framework without delay for all child welfare and protection cases which needs to identify core components while allowing for flexibility.  It is recognised that any such framework will need to be reviewed and updated as knowledge and practice develops and changes.  If one does not have that, then the service will be as the Roscommon case has thrown up — patchy, in some places delivered well and in some places not delivered at all.Another recommendation — I am merely picking two and am not even going into the issue of who is responsible for all of this — states a specialised child sexual abuse unit or team should be put in place in each HSE region to build up expertise and experience in assessment and to act as a centre of excellence when front-line workers require advice, and therapeutic treatment services should also be available for children who had been sexually abused.Will any of the two of these, in particular, the sexual abuse unit, fall now to embargoes?  Are we assured that all of these recommendations will be put in place and how many have been put in place to date?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The recommendations were only recently received, a couple of weeks ago.  I propose to wait until the audit is completed into these neglect cases in Roscommon, Waterford and Dublin to see what comes out of them.  Those areas are targeted because of specific previous concerns that have been raised in those areas.  Based on that report, we will have sufficient information then to aggregate what has come out of Roscommon and previous cases to which Deputy Kathleen Lynch referred in her question.I am open to suggestions on how that implementation and review will take shape.  We might include the NGO sector and others with a professional interest in child protection in ensuring the implementation of the recommendations and all of the previous recommendations.On a child sexual abuse unit, there is, of course, St. Clare's and St. Louise's units, in Temple Street and Crumlin, respectively, which provide an excellent service.  It is not only children who are being abused, but children who have abused as well.  There are discrete services there for the latter but it is a challenging area of the health and social services.In terms of learning, it is depressingly familiar to hear responses that follow tragedies such as this.  Yesterday, I launched the first ever hub of learning in the world for professionals which contains all the research, policy and legislation in this area accumulated over the years.  That is now accessible by social workers.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I accept fully what the Minister is saying.  Anyone who has any interest in this is not out to do damage.  People genuinely want to do right when it comes to it.  However, we do not need an audit to tell us that we need national guidelines.  This report gave us that.  Equally, we do not need an audit to tell us that we need a child sexual abuse unit in HSE regional areas.My big concern is that there will be an audit which will then lead to a group of people sitting down around a table to see what happens next and this time next year we still will not be any further down the road.  There are recommendations in here which need to be implemented now.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	632	The HSE is acting on the vast majority of the recommendations.  They have assured me that they have broken them down into different groups.  There will be four regional workshops in early December to try to disseminate the important aspects of the report and other matters in terms of trying to improve the child protection service.  The recommendations are being acted on.On the audit, that started in September and it will be finished at the end of February, not in the far distant future.  There may be other concerns in Roscommon and we must be alive to that.  There might be other chronic neglect commonalities in other areas to be put in the mix in terms of implementation of this area because it is a discrete area.  The Ryan and Murphy reports talked about institutional care whereas we are talking about family neglect, a discrete area that needs to be looked at in a different way.I agree with Deputy Kathleen Lynch that the recommendations need to be implemented carefully but the HSE has already begun to act on them.  As I stated, we will have more information by the end of February.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	633	Since 2005 there has been a 34% increase in the numbers of consultant radiologists, from 183 to 245.  Ireland now has a ratio of one consultant radiologist per 17,959 of population, which is similar to the UK at one per 18,040 of population.There are currently 5.54 adult consultant radiologists and two paediatric consultant radiologists at Tallaght Hospital.  An additional two locum consultant radiologists were appointed to the hospital in January 2010 to assist in dealing with the backlog of X-rays.  The backlog has been cleared and currently there are 0.54 locums in post at the hospital.  However, on 7 September 2010 the HSE issued formal approval to Tallaght Hospital to appoint two new consultant radiologists.  This is in line with the recommendations of the Hayes report.  Interviews are expected to take place next month and the two successful candidates will take up duty be as soon as possible in 2011.The Hayes report recommended that consultant radiologist staffing levels be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to the workload in each radiology department. The HSE is committed to carrying out a review of consultant radiologist staffing levels in hospitals and to strengthening workforce planning across all radiology departments.  The review will be informed by the results of a survey of consultant radiologist staffing which is currently being undertaken by the faculty of radiology.  The aim is to complete this study by the end of the year.The HSE is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Hayes report as soon as possible.  I am confident that adopting this approach will help ensure the provision of a timely and quality radiology service in Tallaght Hospital.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The reports states clearly:There were severe systemic and other weaknesses at management level, and the structures at Board level were simply not robust enough to provide the level of governance, supervision and direction required in the management of a large and complex organisation.Indeed, the same could be said of the HSE, but we are talking about Tallaght Hospital here.  Warnings were ignored or met with an ineffectual response.  There were 30 occasions between 2005 and 2009 when consultant radiologists expressed concerns about the radiology department and the litany of management responses in that period demonstrates a clear awareness of the problem but no resolve to address it.Tallaght Hospital, as the Minister correctly points out, has 13 radiologists.  St. Vincent's has 16 radiologists yet Tallaght Hospital does twice the amount of X-rays.  Why is this so?  When will the two additional consultants be appointed and commence work?  The Minister will be aware of the problems that an over-reliance on locums has caused in the past.  Permanent staff are what is required here.  According to the Hayes report, it took 13 years and nine years, respectively, to appoint radiologists to Tallaght Hospital.  Why does it take the Department and the HSE so long to appoint desperately needed staff?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	635	As Deputy Reilly has acknowledged, the report draws a number of conclusions.  First, on the formation and governance of the hospital, there are lessons we need to learn when we are bringing hospitals together.  The Tallaght model is not the way to do it.  While I understand it happened in the way it did for ethos and other reasons at the time, the hospital, from a board structure, remained an amalgamation of three different foundations coming from the Adelaide, the children's hospital and the Meath.I have had discussions with the chairman of the board on many occasions.  On Tuesday last he came to see me as a result of the Hayes report.  The board of Tallaght Hospital has put a smaller board in place which, effectively, will be a management board.  It is a sub-group of the current board and it is a smaller group.  It has also appointed Mr. William McKee, who managed health services in Northern Ireland and has a terrific track record, and he is working with the current acting CEO of Tallaght Hospital on the management issues that have arisen in the context of the Hayes report and, indeed, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  Mr. McKee is also a member of the board of the hospital.Tallaght Hospital, in the almost 11 years of its existence, has virtually doubled in staffing size.  As they expanded the number of consultants, they did not have a corresponding increase in the diagnostic staffing, including radiologists.  Certainly, lessons must be learnt from that.The two consultants are currently being recruited.  I understand the hope is that they will be in place in the early part of next year.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I hope they will be in put in place.  From the time of advertising to the time of appointment and of taking up duty, generally, it could be up to 18 months.  They have suffered enough in Tallaght and I note that Deputy Brian Hayes has been highlighting this point.When will the HSE national audit, which reveals if other hospitals experienced a backlog on X-ray or GP referral letters, be completed and published?  Would the Minister care to inform the House how many CEOs Tallaght hospital has had since its inception ten years ago, as opposed to all of the other hospitals which have had far more consistency?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	637	Tallaght hospital has had six CEOs since it was formed.  I knew the first CEO, who came from Canada, well.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was a Minister for Health during some of his tenure.  He was a highly impressive individual but for some reason he did not stay very long.  I think there is a lesson to be learned from the fact that there has been such a rapid turnover of CEOs; six in ten years is not very encouraging.  That is why the board has brought in Mr. McKee, who has wide experience, to work for a number of months along with current management at Tallaght to put into effect not only the recommendations of Hayes, but also its own PricewaterhouseCoopers report and the many other reports commissioned on Tallaght hospital.What was the other question?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	638	When will the other audit be published?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	639	The national audit is very close to completion and it is intended that Dr. White will publish its outcome very soon, I believe before Christmas.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I announced last week that the Government had decided to fund a special voluntary early retirement and severance package in the health sector.  The scheme is aimed at management and administrative staff and support grades.There is general acceptance of the need to reduce the numbers of management and administrative staff in the health service and I have referred to this on many occasions.  For that reason the Government has decided to make €400 million available this year for a specific, targeted voluntary early retirement and severance package for the health service.  Applications from management and administrative staff will be prioritised over those from support staff and will be approved automatically subject to the overall expenditure cap of €400 million not being breached.  This is not the first initiative aimed at reducing numbers.  The number of management and administrative staff , for example, has already fallen by over 1,000 since its peak in September 2007.I am happy to say that there has been a very high level of interest in the new scheme.  As of yesterday, there had been over 8,550 expressions of interest.  Management and administrative staff accounted for over 5,300 of that total and support staff accounted for 3,250.  Of course, not everyone who expresses an interest in the scheme will apply.  The HSE will not know the actual intentions of staff until the closing date for applications, 19 November.The purpose of the scheme is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health service.  The scheme is confined to those two categories of health service employees.  It is not available to civil servants, including those serving in my Department.  The numbers employed in my Department have to be reduced further to 450 by the end of December 2012 and we will use the appropriate mechanisms such as re-organisation and re-allocation of work, including re-deployment where necessary, to meet this target.  However, it should be noted that the numbers in the Department of Health and Children have reduced by 25% from 641 to 477 since 2005.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I thank the Minister.  Would the Minister not agree that had this initiative been undertaken when the HSE was formed, we could have saved more than €1 billion, at €200 million a year?  I am delighted to hear that there is such interest in the scheme.  However, I wonder why it took so long to introduce it.  The Minister alluded to her Department in her reply.  Clearly, there is a need for further reductions in her Department.  The Taoiseach's Department organisational review programme found that some staff have little or nothing to do.  Perhaps the Minister might explain to us why a redundancy package cannot be made available in a broader sense in her Department also.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	642	To be fair, when people talk about the Department they need to realise they are speaking about organisations such as the Adoption Board, which has 29 employees.  They are not all in Hawkins House.  While I accept issues were raised around the organisation and management in the Department and perspectives of staff, I believe that the management team in the Department is implementing the change recommended on foot of that report.  I will send the Deputy tabular details on who is in what section of the Department.  We are the second largest legislation Department in the State.  There seems to be a view that because we established a single entity to deliver health services, the role of Department was diminished, and it was not.With regard to the redundancy, I would have wished to have done it earlier; that is true.  It was not possible to get agreement on the matter when the HSE was being established.  It was not possible to reach agreement with the staff representatives on people being made redundant.  In fact, not only was it not the view of the staff representatives, but it was the view of the political parties opposite.  There was concern at the time that this was part of a great plan to fire thousands of people.  That was never the plan.  However, the view was taken for many reasons that one needed to establish the organisation to see its strengths and weaknesses before one began a restructuring programme.  It has not been possible to get either the money or the agreement before now for this.  We have now and let us make it happen, and I hope it does happen.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	643	Will the Minister make available to members of her Department a redundancy package?  I hope when she mentions the Adoption Board that she is not alluding to it as having little or nothing to do.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	644	They are part of the staff in the Department.  That is the point I was making.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	645	That is right, but I do not think they were singled out in the report as the inference might suggest.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	646	No, I am simply stating that my Department has reduced its staff by approximately 25%.  The Deputy may know, because the Department is dealing with him on his Private Members' Bill, that a very small number of people are in each division of responsibility.  This plan is not open to the Civil Service; it is open only to the HSE.  The incentivised early retirement scheme is open to public servants but this particular redundancy proposal is confined solely to the HSE.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	647	It is the policy of the Government to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, we support access to quality long-term residential care where appropriate.Quality of care and the safety of residents are the key factors driving developments in the provision of long-term care.  All current residential facilities for older people have to comply with the Health Information and Quality Authority's national quality standards for residential care settings for older people in Ireland and the Health Act, 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated facilities) Regulations 2009.  The provision of long-term care also has to be informed by local demographic needs.There are 11 Health Service Executive community hospitals or nursing units operating in Donegal with a maximum 489 beds.  Within the Lifford area, there are HSE facilities in Stranorlar, Ramelton and Buncrana and private nursing homes in Letterkenny and Convoy.Lifford Community Hospital, established in 1799, operates in nightingale style wards.  There are no single rooms in the hospital.  It has a total of 40 beds and it is currently operating as a 20-bed unit.  It is now providing 12 continuing care beds, five respite beds with three beds for assessment, rehabilitation and palliative care.The director of nursing is in contact with residents and their families regarding any concerns they have about the hospital.  No decision has yet been made about what services can be provided safely and in line with national standards at this hospital.  I have, however, asked the HSE to continue meaningful consultation with residents and their families and that all options for their future care will be explored by the HSE with them.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	648	I thank the Minister of State response. I refer to this hospital at the request of Barry O'Neill, who is a councillor in the area, to ensure that it is not further downgraded.  The Minister of State alluded to it being a 40-bed unit; I visited it in June when 30 beds were in operation and now there are 20 beds.  There seems to be a fairly aggressive downgrading of the hospital.  These hospitals are extremely important in community care, particularly in areas such as Donegal which has a very rural spread with very long distances and difficult roads to traverse from one place to another.  Everyone in the House would agree that the best outcome for people if they have to go into a nursing home is that it be in their community where their friends and loved ones can visit them.  Otherwise, what happens is that they wither on the vine.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that this facility will not be further downgraded or closed?
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	649	As I stated, no decision has been made on what will happen in the future, but I have written to the HSE and asked it to consult at all times with the families.  Obviously, their safety is what is of utmost importance to me and to the HSE.  We will consult with the families and the residents at all times.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	650	Will the Minister of State kindly reassure the House that the HSE will not continue with its previous history of using reports that identify deficits in care as an excuse to close facilities instead of addressing the issues raised by the reports?
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	651	It has until 2015 to address the issues but it must deal with them.  These facilities are being inspected, often for the first time.  Many of them are very old buildings.  As I stated, I have asked, in the interests of patient safety, that consideration is given to patients remaining in the own communities and in the local area.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I strongly support the view that access to General Medical Services, GMS, contracts should be opened up to all qualified and vocationally trained GPs who meet general suitability criteria.  The Irish Medical Organisation, the HSE and my Department are parties to the terms of the GMS contract.  A consultation group representing all parties to the contract have been reviewing the provisions relating to entry to the GMS scheme.  Considerable progress has been made in this regard.  An interim arrangement which applied up to 31 March 2010 allowed appropriately qualified and trained GPs to apply for access to the GMS scheme to provide a service to specific categories of patients such as those who become eligible for a medical card under the Health Act 2008 after 1 October 2009.  A total of 178 GPs have been deemed eligible under this arrangement and a further 66 applicants are awaiting a decision pending the supply of further documentation or further clarification.A further initiative which allowed a number of GPs who commenced working under the GP visit card scheme in 2005 to be allowed take on full GMS patients in 2010 was brought forward by one year and implemented from 1 July 2009.  Approximately 50 GPs benefited from this measure.  In addition, work is ongoing to identify a mechanism to up-skill long-term locums or assistants who are not currently eligible for GMS contracts.  My Department and the HSE continue to explore further options to make it easier for new general practitioners to provide services for patients who hold a medical card.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	653	I thank the Minister for her reply.  That all sounds very good and progressive but the Competition Authority notes that before any decision is made regarding a new contract in an area, due regard must be given to the viability of existing GP practices.  The marking system used for selecting who will be given a contract gives more points to GPs who already hold contracts.  As the authority points out, this is not good for either competition, the patient or the service.  Everyone will agree that having competition around the corner from another GP probably forces people to up-skill.  Newly qualified GPs are being forced into practice in existing areas.  It needs to be opened up.I refer to a report by Dr. Ronan Boland whom I know quite well.  He stated that criticism of the decision on payment agreements for GPs was no longer valid.  He said that as part of the Croke Park deal, the most recent public service agreement, the Government said discussions would take place with the Irish Medical Organisation regarding commitments to make appropriate changes to the Competition Act 2002 to enable the IMO to represent its members in negotiations.  I welcome this proposal but where does this leave the poor old Irish Pharmacy Union?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I agree with the Deputy's point about the marking system.  Changes in that marking system are at an advanced stage in order that preference is not given to the individuals as she suggested, and that is only fair.  I have been informed there could be 400 or 500 GPs.  The data suggest it is probably close to 500.  There are a total of 2,600 GPs in active practice, 300 doctors are working in a locum capacity and 2,100 have a GMS contract.  This means there is a gap of 500 GPs and I want those individuals to have access to a GMS contract.  There is an agreement between the Department of Health and Children, the IMO and the HSE — previously the health boards — which precludes that.  I have sought the advice of the Attorney General.  Under the Croke Park agreement we hope to be able to reach agreement on some of these issues.  This would involve the change of the contract in this case.The Competition Act is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  Any changes to competition law are a matter for him and not for my Department.

That is as it should be and I fully concur with Deputy Lynch's argument.  As a backdrop, is there not also the issue of the real shortage of GPs per head of population?  When a comparison is made between Ireland and Germany, it is noted that Germany has twice as many GPs per 100,000 of the population.  In France the number is in excess of three times as many.  The number of GPs in Ireland is 52 per 100,000 of the population and up to 164 GPs per 100,000 of the population in France.  Is there not a major need to increase places to allow for a greater throughput of GPs into the system?  In 2001, some 600 primary care units were promised but only 112 have been realised and there is a real need.  Will the Minister comment on this aspect of the question posed?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	656	I welcome the Deputy's comments regarding opening up the GMS scheme to all GPs.  He is correct that there is a shortage of GPs.  We have increased the number of training places this year from 120 to 157.  We have also greatly increased the number of medical students.  The big challenge will be to keep those students of medicine in Ireland or in medicine anywhere because a fair number of medical students do not subsequently stay in medicine.  A large number also leave the country, some for reasons of training and others on a more permanent basis.We have a number of challenges such as opening up access.  It is not fair that not all GPs have access to the GMS scheme.  The terms of the GMS contract require the parties to agree and to give notice of an intention to break the contract.  I have sought the advice of the Attorney General because contracts cannot go against the law.  A number of GPs do not have access to the GMS practice and are very agitated, and rightly so.  Those issues need to be addressed in the interest of fairness and equity but also in the interests of having wider access to general practitioners with a GMS contract.The primary care teams involve individuals working together in a different way.  I accept there are deficits in the system.  Even if all health professionals are working in the community and working better together on a team basis, that in itself has significant benefits for patients.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I concur with other speakers and I encourage the Minister to open up the GMS scheme to suitably qualified GPs.  I echo the point made by Deputy Ó Caoláin about the shortage of GPs in the country.  Certain areas such as Tallaght have no GP practice.  If the contract is to be changed, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that in the opening of up the GMS scheme to GPs, they do not all end up in Grafton Street with no one out in Tallaght.  The message is clear that we need to have a structure to encourage GPs into areas where they are needed to provide a service.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	658	The Minister alluded to the fact that many GPs have been many years in practice but are not in the GMS system.  Will they be given priority because they are being treated most unfairly?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	659	The change must be made in the first instance.  Anyone who is qualified should have access to a GMS contract if they have the necessary qualifications and vocational training.  If this is the case there should be no barrier.  It is in the interests of the HSE to provide supports for GPs based on volume of patients.  It would not be acceptable for a small practice to be given the same level of support as a large practice with a large number of patients, especially in disadvantaged areas.  This may not appeal to everyone but I favour distorting the way we pay GPs to favour those operating in more disadvantaged areas where the challenges are greater.  This is the practice in other countries.  In the context of any new contracts, we need to examine this policy.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	660	I am concerned about the high level of alcohol consumption in Ireland, especially among younger people.  One in four deaths in young men between the ages of 15 and 34 is due to alcohol, compared with one in 12 deaths due to cancers and one in 25 deaths due to circulatory disease.  Suicide rates have doubled in Ireland in the past 20 years.  Alcohol is a  factor in nearly half of all young male suicides.As Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, protecting the health of our young people from alcohol related harm is one of my key priorities.  Participation in sport is a key element of the health and social well-being of our children as well as the rest of the population and I want to promote this very positive relationship between sport and health.Following a Government decision in 2008, a working group was established to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government to discuss the question of the sponsorship of sporting events by the alcohol industry with a view to phasing it out.This report was published in June 2010 and subsequently the Minister, Deputy Harney, referred it to the steering group developing the national substance misuse strategy to assist in its deliberations on the issues of alcohol marketing and sponsorship.  The national substance misuse strategy is intended to incorporate alcohol policy with the already agreed drugs policy element.  The steering group is examining a wide range of issues on alcohol policy such as pricing, availability, treatment, prevention, marketing and sponsorship and working towards completing its work before the end of the year.  I look forward to receiving its report and considering its recommendations.With regard to the specific matter of curtailing alcohol sponsorship of sports events at a European level, there is no legislative framework at a European level to control or regulate marketing or sponsorship by the alcohol industry.  Member states have national competence in this area.  It is a matter for individual member states to introduce and implement measures at national level if they wish to control sports event sponsorship in their own jurisdiction.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	661	One of the most staggering figures I have seen in a long time is that 16 and 17 year olds in Ireland spend approximately €145 million a year on alcohol.  We all know it is not possible to put an old head on young shoulders and that we need to divert young men and women away from alcohol-related activities.  The only way they seek such diversion is through sport and community activity.  However, we do not provide enough facilities in communities to allow that to happen.  We have magnificent organisations, the IRFU and the GAA, etc., but some teenagers do not want to join these clubs and want alternatives.  There was a very sad case in Cork recently.

A young man in his first few weeks in college while with a small group of friends died from alcohol poisoning.  It was not intentional; it was just something they did because they were celebrating.

I am sure some of them will refer to activities within communities.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	666	I do not have a timeframe at this point.  However, the question is on sponsorship of sports events by alcohol companies, one of the issues the steering group is considering, but it has not yet reached a decision.  Representatives of sports groups, including the FAI and the IRFU, recently met the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to discuss the isssue of sports sponsorship.  It is still being discussed, but I will certainly take the group's recommendations very seriously.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	667	An article in The Lancet concluded that “aggressively targeting alcohol harms is a valid and necessary public health strategy”.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I am only alluding to them, Sir.  There is obviously still a need to reduce demand for alcohol, address the availability of cheap alcohol and have fewer outlets and restricted sports event sponsorship.  Will the Government make representations to the European Union in this regard?  I accept the matter is within the remit of individual governments, but we need to start somewhere.  Surely Ireland could give a lead and show we have a concern in this regard.  While I know it is not within the remit of the Minister of State, perhaps she could discuss with her colleague in the Department of Education and Skills whether there should be school modules on the use and dangers of alcohol.  As Deputy Kathleen Lynch pointed out, students arriving from secondary school in university find themselves with freedom and disposable income and we have heard what can happen.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	672	The topic of alcohol and health is discussed at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council which agreed a set of conclusions at a meeting in December 2009, which indicates the importance of the issue across the European Union.  As I said, member states may implement measures at national level.  As there is no facility at European level, we implement our own measures within our own jurisdiction.

In trying to address it is the Minister of State cognisant that in the past week an editorial in a newspaper with a significant circulation figure totally excused the conduct of a radio presenter who had engaged in a lewd act on a flight into Ireland on the grounds that he was not able to remember the incident?  It is incredible that an editorial would reflect such sympathy.  How will we ever tackle the issue of alcohol abuse against such a backdrop where a newspaper actually excuses the conduct of an individual because he was not able to remember it?
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	674	As I said, I am concerned at the high level of alcohol consumption among younger people andlook forward to receiving the recommendations of the steering group which is working on the matter.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	675	Does the Minister of State agree that advertising has a significant impact on young people?  We heard all of the arguments that sports would collapse without tobacco advertising and sponsorship but that did not happen.  Does the Minister of State agree that we should consider the connection between alcohol advertising and sport?

It is a major issue.  Obviously, the sports organisations are concerned about the financial impact it would have.  Their representatives recently met the relevant Minister.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	677	The most recent information on bed closures in the acute hospital system is for the week ending 7 November.  At that point 892 inpatient beds and 19 day beds were closed for reasons of infection control, refurbishment or cost containment.  This is from a complement of approximately 11,800 inpatient beds and 1,800 day beds in the public hospital system.Access to appropriate care for patients is not about the number of beds in the hospital but about providing quality care and improving outcomes for patients.  Previously many procedures such as varicose vein surgery and hernia procedures required patients to stay in hospital.  These can now be provided, in the main, on a day-case basis.  This is better for patients and a more efficient use of resources.  The average cost of an inpatient bed is €889 per day or €324,485 per year.There is a significant variation between hospitals on the length of stay of patients in hospital for similar procedures.  Reducing the length of stay in hospitals whcih have above average lengths of stay will be good for patients, as well as being more cost-effective.  Hospitals are also working to reduce admissions by, for example, identifying patients who may only need diagnostics and should not require an inpatient stay in hospital.In 2009 the combined number of inpatient and day case discharges was 3% greater than in 2008.  The HSE's national plan for 2010 maintains the focus on increased efficiency and is committed to delivering broadly the same level of overall hospital activity as in 2009.  It is important that the clear focus of the health service is on the number of patients we treat, not on the number of beds.  Increasingly our focus is on measuring patient outcomes.  This will continue to be the focus in the coming years.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	678	To a great extent, I agree with the philosophy that it is better for patients to spend as little time in hospital as possible.  However, last night there were 31 patients on trolleys in Cork University Hospital.  Regardless of how good we become or how speedy the procedure is, we will still need beds in hospitals for those who still need to be in hospital.  We cannot continue to cut back on the numbers of beds.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	679	A question please, Deputy.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	680	If we continue in this vein, what point will we need to reach before the closing of beds will stop?  Do we have 30,000 beds in the system?  Can the Minister provide a figure?  Clearly, we do not have sufficient beds to meet the needs of patients.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	681	Over the past several years we have increasingly relied on day case activity rather than inpatient accommodation as a way of providing treatment.  Last year, the HSE devised a basket of 24 procedures with the British Association of Day Surgery and set targets for hospitals to increase day activity on these procedures from 62% to 75%.  There are huge variations in performance across the country.  Tallaght hospital does best in the treatment of hernias, with 84% treated on a day case bases, whereas some hospitals have rates of as low as 37%.  Mayo had 16% day rates and an average stay of three days for its 138 patients.  Some hospitals are better than others at carrying out procedures on a day case basis.I will not pretend some beds are not being closed for cost containment reasons.  Next year will be even more challenging given the reductions required in public and health expenditure.  The fiscal adjustment of €6 billion will have a major impact on the resources available for health services, which account for 27% of current Government spending.  The quicker we move to best practice on day activity, the better.  This year, the HSE committed in its service plan to carrying out 10,000 diagnostic tests on an outpatient basis and to moving 33,000 people from accident and emergency departments to day case diagnostic activity.  I look forward to learning the outcome of these commitments and understand the HSE is on target in delivering on them.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	682	In regard to the variation between Tallaght and Mayo, hernias are more common among older people and I do not doubt social isolation, age, lack of carers and remoteness play a large part in explaining why patients cannot be treated on a day case basis.Will the Minister acknowledge that the number of beds in the system has decreased from 18,000 20 years ago to fewer than 11,000 today despite a population increase of 750,000 during the same period?  There have been repeated calls from this side of the House to provide rehabilitation facilities so that people can move to the next phase of treatment after leaving hospital.  Last night in Beaumont hospital, 47 patients were lying on trolleys.  Another hospital in Dublin had 175 people in what it called delayed discharge situations for up to nine months.  The CEO of this hospital advised me that 30 of the patients could avail of rehabilitation services but that the remaining 140 would need long-term care.  When pressed as to whether they received appropriate care at the time of discharge, he admitted that at least 50% of them could have gone home with the support of rehabilitation.  Not only are we costing the taxpayer money, but we are also doing a terrible disservice to patients.  I ask the Minister why she does not provide additional rehabilitation beds for the greater Dublin area, where they are needed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	683	I accept what the Deputy said about the shortage of rehabilitation facilities.  Acute rehabilitation could be provided in a more localised environment and an enormous amount of work has been done on requirements at both national and local levels.  Fantastic rehabilitation facilities have been developed in the mid-west for stroke and other patients in order to bring them home and get them better more quickly.  I accept that deficits remain to be addressed, however.The fair deal scheme has reduced by 33% the number of delayed discharges in the Dublin area.  I hope to see the scheme being expedited over the latter months of this year and early 2011.  The system is up and running and over 12,000 people have availed of it because people who could be in long-term care continue to occupy hospital beds.

In response to previous parliamentary questions she estimated these cuts at between €600 million and €1 billion.  How will she explain the ongoing abuse and waste within our two tier system to patients who depend on public hospitals?  Clinical directors and hospital managers have had to write to almost 300 consultants regarding blatant breaches of contractual obligations on the ratio of public to private practice.  I could provide a list of issues which are causing tremendous vexation and deep anger in many quarters.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	685	The Deputy is correct that the reductions in health spending next year will be a minimum of €600 million but, as the Government has not finalised the four year plan or the Estimates for next year, I am not in a position to confirm the exact figure.  When I know the figure, I will sit down with the HSE to work out how the budgetary parameters can be implemented.  I do not pretend it will be easy and it will be particularly challenging for the acute hospital system.Consultants are obliged to meet the terms of their contracts and it is a matter for hospitals and the HSE to pursue breaches.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is my ambition not to have private activity in public hospitals.  The reason for the co-location model was to ensure beds currently being occupied by private patients who have alternatives can be used instead by public patients.  I recognise the Deputy does not agree with that policy but in a country where half the population has private health insurance, we are going to have large numbers of private patients in public hospitals.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	686	Is consideration being given to people who do not require hospitalisation for surgical procedures when stress tests are carried out?  I have found that such people have to stay longer in hospital than other patients.Cork University Hospital is probably at the higher end of the list of bed costs because it is that type of hospital.  How many are occupying beds in the hospital who could instead be in rehabilitation and what is the position for HSE south?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	687	Cork University Hospital is at the higher end because of the acuity and complexity of the work carried out there relative to other hospitals.  I set out the average costs but they vary depending on staff levels and other factors.We have been making advances on an agreed policy approach for the country as a whole.  Heretofore the approach was to send everybody to a single national rehabilitation hospital for acute rehabilitation treatment.  That is being rethought and there is more emphasis on developing a national tertiary facility and a hub and spoke pattern of outreach services in the regions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	688	I welcome the Hayes report into the management of radiology and GP referral letters at Tallaght hospital, which was published on 4 November.  The report is thorough and clear in its conclusions.The Tallaght hospital review identified serious concerns about the robustness of the governance structures at board and management level within the hospital.  The particular problems with the board and management structure, culture and style must be addressed urgently.  The report also points to the inadequacy of reporting systems; the lack of clear lines of responsibility; inadequate risk management; lack of written protocols and procedures; communications within the hospital and with the main stakeholders; and poorly developed relationships with GPs in the area.  All of these problems are clearly inconsistent with a patient-centred approach.  The report makes detailed constructive recommendations about the operation of specific services in the hospital and all of these will be implemented.Tallaght hospital has 600 beds and employs nearly 3,000 staff.  It operates on a budget of €245 million, of which €189 million is provided by the State.  Within this resource allocation, the hospital should be able to provide patients with a safe and comprehensive service.I met Dr. Hayes on 8 November to discuss the implications of his report and I met the chair of Tallaght hospital on 9 November.  I have also had discussions with the CEO of the HSE about the report.  The main focus will be on the initiatives that are needed in the hospital and in the wider health system to provide sustained improvements in services for patients.  The HSE and Tallaght Hospital have accepted all the recommendations in the report and are committed to implementing them as quickly as possible.  A number of key recommendations regarding the management of X-rays and GP referral letters have already been implemented.  I understand changes have also been made by Tallaght Hospital to the operation of its board, which I mentioned earlier.

I urge the full and early implementation of all the recommendations in the report.  Tallaght hospital is a fine hospital.  Its staff and patients deserve full support.  While I acknowledge that progress is being made in addressing administration and filing deficiencies, I must refer again to the cutbacks the Minister has signalled for 2011.  What impact does the Minister expect those cutbacks to have on X-rays and GP referrals?  How can a significant increase in the amount of time people have to wait to secure treatments be avoided?

I want that figure to be reduced in line with what is happening in the economy.  In addition, almost €2 billion is spent on drugs.  A further €1 billion is spent on non-core pay, such as premium, overtime and on-call pay.  The bulk of the reductions need to be found in that basket so that services to the public are not adversely affected.  There is a major job to be done in Tallaght Hospital to address the deficiencies that have been identified in this report; in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which the hospital commissioned; and in the Teamwork report.  The recommendations in the various reports that have examined the operation of Tallaght Hospital need to be implemented as soon as possible.  I have received a commitment from the chairman that that will happen.

If the Chair will indulge me, I would like to correct something I said on the record last week.  I mentioned that a Government backbencher was given an appointment date for a CT scan that is 13 months away.  In fact, he was given an appointment date that is four and a half months away for a simple X-ray.  I should have said he has several constituents who are waiting 13 and a half months for CT scans.  I would like to raise an aspect of the workings of Tallaght Hospital with the Minister.  Does she intend to put any particular structures in place?  Has she identified the problems that have led to such a high turnover of CEOs?  Can she assure the House that the matter is under——

It seems from the various reflections and reports we have been given since Tallaght Hospital was established, particularly the Hayes report, that insufficient homework was done in advance of the merging into one big entity of three small hospitals that had very different perspectives.  When one goes into Tallaght Hospital, one will see evidence of the involvement of the Adelaide Foundation, the Meath Foundation and the Children's Foundation.  We have to learn lessons from that.  That is why so much work is being done in advance of the development of the new children's hospital.  We are trying to tease out some of these issues.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	702	In the first instance, I have spoken to Dr. Hayes.  I have read his report.  It is always important to speak to the authors of these reports.  I did not meet him until he completed his report because I did not think it would be appropriate for me to do so.  He did not ask to meet me.  I had a long meeting with him on Monday.  I got his insights, in addition to what he had said in the report.  I met the chairman on Tuesday morning, with Mr. William McKee, who has come from Northern Ireland at the behest of the chairman and the board to assist the new acting manager, Mr. O'Connell, in the implementation of the key recommendations.  I have every confidence that the chairman, Mr. McCann, and the board of the hospital are taking this matter seriously and will put into effect the recommendations in the Hayes report and the other changes that are needed if there is to be a modern and functioning hospital in the south-west part of Dublin.  I have every confidence that that will happen.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	703	Approximately 77 million laboratory tests are undertaken across 44 public hospitals each year.  The HSE announced plans last year to modernise laboratory services and achieve significant efficiencies in the configuration and operation of such services.  As part of this initiative, the HSE is in discussions with the National Development Finance Agency about the capital financing of a small number of dedicated cold laboratories which would process the large volumes of routine patient tests currently processed in hospital laboratories.  An outline business case, including a cost-benefit analysis, has been developed.  It identifies and analyses a number of options for financing the various cold laboratory site configurations.  The options include direct public provision, direct private provision and public private partnership.  These options are being considered by the HSE.  The Croke Park agreement acknowledges the advanced level of engagement of the relevant stakeholders in the delivery of major changes to medical laboratory services.  We would like to see early progress in this area.  Discussions between the HSE and the relevant trade unions on the introduction of revised work practices in existing laboratories, in the context of the Croke Park agreement, are under way.  I understand good progress is being made in this regard.  This process will quickly help to inform decisions on the modernisation of medical laboratory services within the cost, efficiency and quality parameters that need to be met.

The answer I received to one question, which was particularly detailed, was incomplete.  I have to say, with respect, that the answer the Minister has given me this afternoon is also incomplete.  I will persist, however.  The Minister claimed in response to Questions Nos. 84 and 85 of 22 April last that the Association of Clinical Biochemists in Ireland was consulted when the Teamwork report was being drawn up.  I have the parliamentary replies in question if the Minister wishes to refer to them.  The association has assured me that it was not consulted, contrary to what the Minister said.  I am aware that the association has also contacted other Deputies.  Have the Minister and the HSE examined the danger that this service will become fragmented, for example when the testing that is done in primary and secondary cases is separated?  Do they agree it is possible that clinical liaison and input will be weakened under the proposed privatised and centralised model?  The Minister did not reply to that important part of the question I asked on that occasion.  Will a cost-benefit analysis be carried out on the aspect of this approach that would see many tests being done externally, and possibly overseas?  Is any effort being made to establish the real cost of this approach?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I said in my reply that there is good engagement on this issue, through the Croke Park agreement, between the staff representatives and the HSE.  There has been some rationalisation and reconfiguration in this area since the Teamwork report was published.  Work practices have changed and more laboratories have been accredited.  That is the good news.  We need to achieve efficiencies in this area.  The more efficiencies we achieve, the more money we have for patient services.  It is intended to roll out the changed work practices in a number of key hospitals, including St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital, quite soon.  That will inform that decisions that will be made.  It is clear that a cost-benefit analysis will be carried out.  The Teamwork report gave us a great deal of food for thought on how we can offer a safer and higher quality service that is more cost-effective.  That is what we have to do.

Is she aware that her policy of essentially ending the role of hospital laboratories is resulting in the flight of highly trained, highly qualified people who would ordinarily have taken up employment in laboratories on a number of hospital sites across the State?  We are losing them and we are witnessing a brain drain.  How does she square that with the Government's so-called commitment to a knowledge economy?

This is about how we organise the service and whether we continue to provide it all in house or whether we outsource it or combine the public and private sectors.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	718	The European Court of Auditors report on the sugar reform package of 2006 published yesterday was addressed directly to the European Commission.  The report also contains a comprehensive 17-page response from the European Commission to the court's findings.As the Commission itself explains in that response, the sugar reform was concluded against the background of the EU's Everything But Arms Initiative, EBA, in 2001 and the 2005 World Trade Organisation, WTO, ruling on the EU sugar regime.  The EBA granted the least developed countries free access to the EU market, including sugar.  The WTO necessitated a reduction of subsidised EU sugar exports.  In response, the EU had to cut its sugar production to maintain the appropriate market balance.  The combination of these factors led the Commission to bring forward proposals for the reform of the EU sugar regime.As the Commission's own reply to the report points out, the reform was based on a voluntary system of quota renunciation underpinned in particular by a temporary restructuring fund as well as support price reductions.  The choice of abandoning or keeping production was to be made by every sugar producing company bearing in mind that in future they would have to secure their long-term profitability in a situation of substantially lower institutional prices.During the reform negotiations, my colleague, the Tánaiste and then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, strongly opposed the Commission's reform proposals and sought to have them modified in such a way that an efficient sugar industry might have been retained in Ireland.  She led a group of 14 member states that opposed the proposals.  In the end, there was insufficient political support for the Irish position and our efforts, towards the close of the negotiations, had to be redirected at achieving the best possible compensation package.There have been some suggestions that out of date information may have impacted on the negotiations.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Commission explains the relevance of its impact assessment, stating: "This model does not require an analysis of the current profitability and prospects of every individual sugar producer in the EU. Therefore the Commission did not consider it necessary to collect such data on productivity for the model chosen."  However, the Commission rightly points out it opted for a reform model where final decisions would be taken by individual sugar companies.  At all stages during the negotiations we brought to the table the most up to date information about the position in Ireland, including the fact that there was only one sugar processing plant operating in Ireland.  The Commission was well aware of the fact that the Carlow plant had closed prior to the publication of the Commission proposals.Greencore plc, the sole Irish sugar processor and holder of the entire Irish quota allocation, decided to avail of the restructuring scheme.  Accordingly, the company renounced the quota and dismantled the remaining Irish Sugar factory at Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme.  This brought the Irish sugar industry to an end.  Ireland negotiated the best possible deal in the event of quota holder, namely Greencore plc, taking the commercial decision to exit the industry.  While it is not appropriate for me to say why Greencore plc took the decision it did, I refer Deputies to the Commission response to what is obviously a reference to the plant in Mallow in paragraph 30 of the audit report.  The Commission points out that sugar production can only remain competitive if both beet production and beet processing are carried out competitively and states: "It is also possible that performing industrial facilities were forced to close down due to the limited competitiveness of the beet grown in the surroundings. This appears to be the case described by the Court."The sugar reform package that Ireland secured was, as a whole — that is, including restructuring aid, diversification aids and single payment — worth €353 million, of which €220 million went to beet growers, €127 million to Greencore and €6 million to machinery operators.  The beet growers' share was made up of diversification aid, namely, €44 million, compensation via the single payment, which amounted to €123 million over seven years, and restructuring aid of €41million.  The restructuring and diversification aids were paid out during 2007 and 2008.To draw down the restructuring aid, Greencore plc, had to submit a restructuring plan, incorporating a social plan and an environmental plan; the plan did not apply to the Carlow factory, which had already closed prior to the reform of the EU sugar regime. The social plan provided for early retirement and redundancy packages as well as support services for the departing Mallow workers such as career counselling, financial advice including pension advice, pre-retirement programmes for those aged over 50 years, job-seeking support and "start your own business" programmes.  The social plan was implemented in the first year of restructuring. The environmental plan will be finished at the end of this year.As a result of the restructuring scheme the overall EU sugar quota was reduced by almost 6 million tonnes, of which the Irish quota contributed some 200,000 tonnes.  Any proposal to re-establish a sugar factory in Ireland would, subject to the availability of quota, be a matter for commercial decision by interested parties.  Any proposal to review the EU sugar quota would be a matter for the EU Commission.  A quantity of sugar beet has been always grown in Ireland for fodder purposes and this continues.  It is not affected by the EU sugar regime.Much has been said in this House on the issue of the special share held by the Minister.  I wish to make clear, and this has been confirmed by legal advice, that this special share does not empower the Minister to get involved in operational matters or business decisions made by the company.

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the findings of the European Court of Auditors report, even it was difficult this morning to secure an agreement to have a debate on it.  It is regrettable that the Tánaiste who was Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at that time, is not here.Facts are facts and questions still remain unanswered, with all due respect to the Minister's contribution.  The facts of the dismantling of the Irish sugar industry are there for all to see but a number of questions must be asked.  Did the Government and the Minister of the day carry out due diligence as the guardians of the public interest — notwithstanding what the Minister said about the legal opinion on the entitlement of the then Minister to get involved in operational matters — on the information submitted to the European Commission by Greencore?  Was Ireland's unique position in that it had only one recently modernised plant on which the growers were completely dependent defended properly?  Was that case made strongly or not at all?  Was the fact that Ireland was going to become totally dependent on imported sugar for a strategic product for the agri-food businesses, chemical industries and as an ingredient in many feed products considered?  Was the fact that sugar beet was a critical crop in the tillage sector considered, and in particular for malt barley producers, who faced challenges with the introduction of the nitrates directive which, thankfully, has been somewhat addressed?  Was that case made both to Greencore and the European Commission?  Was any consideration given at that time to the fact that there was a significant advantage to using sugar as a source of bioethanol, which would have placed further demands on supplies worldwide?  In 2006 this was already well flagged and there was a spike in oil prices at the time.  After Ireland renounced its entire quota for sugar production, the EU restructuring fund ended up benefiting mostly private industry shareholders.  Unfortunately, this is a classic tale of Celtic tiger Fianna Fáil — the national interest, the growers and the workers were all abandoned in the interests of the enrichment of an elite few.Ireland is now importing €99 million worth of sugar, which does not include molasses and other sugar by-products for the chemical industry, in contrast to six years ago when we were an exporter of sugar products.  The question remains as to who were the main beneficiaries of the EU compensation fund of €145 million, though the Minister has broadened that out to include other factors.  Why did the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food decide not to defend the national interest and the tillage farmers in the sugar industry and allow the closure of all the sugar processing plant capacity in Ireland?My final question relates to the European Court of Auditors report.  Has the reform of the European sugar market achieved its objectives?  For the European consumer the answer has to be ‘No'.   Point 63 of the report states that most of the cost savings due to price reductions will be added to the profit margin of industrial producers.  For the developing world producer, the answer to the question I posed is ‘No'.  For Ireland, the answer is definitely ‘No'.  As I said at the outset, spin is spin but facts are facts.I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to revisit this issue and initiate an investigation with the Commission with a view to re-establishing the sugar industry in Ireland.  When we consider all the facts and the changed circumstances surrounding our competitiveness, the Irish Government and the European Commission owe this much to the growers and to the people involved in this industry.An article written by Dr. Martin Thelen from Bonn some years ago states:What are the perspectives for the future?. . . there will still be opportunities for European sugar production if every available means is used to compensate for the disadvantages associated . . .  In a global comparison, the European sugar . . . [industry have] considerable . . . and significant competitive advantage. . . .Moreover, the movement towards renewable resources could prove particularly interesting for the European sugar beet industry, opening up perspectives, for example, in the cultivation of sugar beet as a raw material for ethanol production.These are not my words but the words of an objective observer.There is no reason we cannot re-establish the sugar industry.  It was re-established previously when Siúcre Éireann was established in the 1920s.  That was not the first establishment of the sugar industry here.  It can be re-established again, reconfigured for today's environment and competitive considerations.  There is nothing to stop us having a sugar processing plant and a bioethanol production unit on the one site.  We have a biofuels obligation of 3% or 4%, which is currently constituted of imported bioethanol.  It makes no sense not to have a sugar industry when we could have a thriving one.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	721	We imported €99.9 million worth of sugar into Ireland last year and €76.4 million worth the previous year.  The price of sugar on the world markets has never been higher — there is a shortage of sugar.  We have gone from being a country that exported sugar to one that is totally dependent on foreign imports.  We have also lost an industry and the Minister knows better than anybody else, or he should know, how important that industry was for farmers.I come from the Midleton area of east Cork, which is known as the Paris basin of Ireland due to the quality of the land in the area.  Most of the sugar beet produced was grown around Midleton.  The loss of that industry was major.  It is alarming that the decision made at that time, which destroyed the industry, was based on out-of-date information.  That is what the European Court of Auditors has said.  It comes down to that in a nutshell. Where was the then Minister at the time?  Why did she not ensure the figures were updated and upgraded?  Why did she and the Department not ensure the information on which the decision was based was up to date?  The European Court of Auditors, an independent respected body, has made a definitive judgment and we have to take it seriously.I will call on the Minister to come before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to engage in a proper, interactive debate on this issue.As Deputy Doyle stated, it is crucially important that we factor into this debate the issue of ethanol production.  Ethanol is being imported into Whitegate, which is just down the road from Midleton and the east Cork area.  The factory in Mallow should never have been closed.  It was convenient for Greencore that the Carlow plant had closed previously as it allowed the company to go to Brussels with only one factory in the bag, as it were.  Only three countries in Europe ended up without a sugar industry.  Even Nordic countries such as Sweden and Finland retained a sugar industry.  Surely Ireland, which is further south and warmer, is in a better position that these countries to grow sugar beet.The sugar industry was a profitable industry which paid for Christmas in many agricultural homes across the country.  Contractors, hauliers, factory workers and farmers depended on the sector.The decision to close the Mallow plant was taken very quickly.  I recall being in the House at the time and trying to obtain information about the closure because it took place virtually overnight.  Much more investigation of this matter is required.

The Tánaiste rather than the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, should be before the House because she sat on the Council of Ministers which made the decision that resulted in the closure of the Irish sugar industry.The loss of the sugar beet industry resulted in farms in County Wexford becoming less viable and dealt a severe blow to the local economy, including agricultural contractors, suppliers and hauliers.  As a result, it has become less viable for young people to remain in the farm sector.  The beet industry was one of the most profitable and viable industries in the agriculture sector.  Farmers did not want compensation; they wanted to continue to grow beet.The Minister has many questions to answer on behalf of the Government.  Is it true that the European Commission was using out-of-date information?  The answer is either "Yes" or "No".  The Tánaiste, who was the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the time, must have been asleep at the relevant meetings of the Council of Ministers.  Was she properly informed about the position at the time?The Government must urgently consider the possibility of beet being grown again for use as an alternative energy crop.  Coming from a northern county, I am not sure the Minister is aware of the importance of the beef industry to the south.  This is a major issue and the Government must take heed of it.  The Minister is part of the Government which got rid of the sugar beet industry.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	723	I express solidarity with the workers and growers in north Cork, the area with which I am most familiar, who fought tooth and nail and through thick and thin to try to keep the sugar factory in Mallow operational.  They were given a clear indication that the factory had a viable future if efficiencies and changed work practices were introduced.  Having agreed to the changes, the workforce was sold out by the Fianna Fáil Government.The Tánaiste, who was the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the time, made the following statement to the House this morning:Second, as then Minister for Agriculture and Food, I opposed the Commission's proposals, as the Members will be aware and led the group of 14 in its opposition to that reform.  I led that opposition with a number of other colleagues in the European Union.There is a disparity between this statement and the minutes of the meeting of the Council of Ministers of 20 February 2006, which state:The Council successfully adopted by qualified majority the three Regulations on the reform of the sugar sector as set out in documents 5588/06, 5589/06, 5590/06.  The Greek, Polish, and Latvian delegations voted against.If the Greek, Polish and Latvian delegations voted against the so-called reforms, only the Tánaiste, who was a party to the discussions in the Council of Ministers and claims she opposed the proposals, is in a position to describe what occurred at the meeting.  Why is she not present to clarify the matter?  She owes an explanation to the growers of north Cork and elsewhere in the country as well as the workers who lost their jobs as a result of the decision taken by the Council of Ministers.I remind the Minister that some of the same workers had to wait for more than 12 months for redundancy payments.  I was a councillor at the time and had to seek supplementary welfare payments on the behalf of workers at the Mallow plant, pending the outcome of negotiations with Greencore, a company that had received millions of euro from the compensation fund.  That story was never told because we were in the midst of the Celtic tiger and the Government side did not want to hear it.The bottom line is that the former Minister shifted her position from one in which she was in a blocking minority with other countries to one in which she accepted the compensation package.  She owes it to people in north Cork, all those who grew beet and everyone else who was affected by the decision to explain the reason she shifted her position.  That is the least the House deserves in terms of the history of this episode.In 2005, I stated that if Ireland was to stop producing sugar, the perfect place to start producing ethanol was either Carlow or Mallow.  Ethanol is now being imported into Whitegate.  The Labour Party tabled an amendment on the biofuels Bill providing for the imposition of a tariff on ethanol imports to stimulate local production.  Despite the presence of the Green Party in government, this measure has not been taken.  If we are not to produce sugar again, we should at least produce ethanol locally to meet the requirements of the biofuel obligation.  The Government must explain the position it took on this matter.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	724	I take issue with some of the remarks made by the Minister.  As a former employee of the sugar company, I suffered a double whammy when the sugar factory in Carlow closed.  Following the closure the then Government created a great deal of hope in the area when the Progressive Democrats Party promised that train stations would be built all over the place to collect beet to transport to Mallow.  The rug was quickly pulled from under that idea, however, and those who suffered were the large number of people who benefited from the sugar industry.While the Minister indicated that the Government made a strong case, the facts available to us suggest that was not the case.I note, however, that members of the Committee of Public Accounts accept that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General will have processed each item of the agenda it puts forward.  Is it not a fact that the auditors had all the information available to them to make this decision?  Consequently, must it not be a fact that if the European Court of Auditors stated that Ireland's data were out of date and that information was unavailable, this is what was put before it?  Therefore, must it not follow that Ireland's case was weakened because it could not put the proper facts to those who sought to support us because our data were weak, out of date and did not reflect what we had done?One also could question what we did because I have grave doubts about Greencore's intentions when it closed the Carlow sugar plant.  Was it forward planning or simply plain greed?  I believe it was the latter because the company closed the plant to make the lands available for development.  This was proved subsequently by the speed with which the company moved in to eradicate the plant.  This was its scheme and plan, after which it moved on and it was only a matter of time before the company adopted the same process in respect of Mallow.  It drew the rug from under the people there and destroyed an industry that had supplied this country from 1926 onwards.  It destroyed an industry that had provided so much employment for so many people and which had been one of the main makers of an industrial background here through the provision of apprenticeships and so on.The Government has let the people down badly in its defence of this point.  As assertion in this House that the European Court of Auditors is wrong when it had all the facts before it constitutes misinformation and the Minister should rectify this point.  The report states the papers show that Greencore justified its point in respect of a risk and not on a fact.  The company made its decision "due to the risk of lower prices", and so closed Mallow upon a risk.  It did not even wait to ascertain what would happen as the risk of lower prices was enough for it to pull the rug and move on, as it perceived it, to the Celtic tiger and the development of Carlow and Mallow to make more money for its shareholders.  As Deputy Sherlock has rightly stated, it forgot the people who had put the industry there as well as all those who had supported it, including farmers of all sizes.It is a disgrace and I ask the Minister to be honest with Members.  He should not state in this House that the report is wrong because I believe what the European Court of Auditors has put in front of Members.  It is the job of the court to do the right thing, to examine everything in front of it and to put it forward in an honest and truthful fashion.  To suggest this report is wrong is a major mistake on the Minister's part.  It certainly will be noted nationwide by those who lost a major part of their lives, financial security and the industry they supplied throughout an era in Ireland.I must contradict Deputy Stanton's observation that Cork was the only place.

Today, however, the Government is trying to hide behind a statement to the effect that the auditors' report was wrong.  I ask the Minister to retract his statement because it is erroneous and will reflect badly on him as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in this ongoing debate.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	727	When the draft European Union sugar proposals were outlined in 2005, the Minister was not in his present portfolio.  His colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, was then Minister for Agriculture and Food.  In the Dáil on 2 May 2005, she blamed the decision to close the Carlow factory on the likely consequences of reform but assured Members at the time that Greencore would keep Mallow open.  Of course, it decided to close the plant anyway, a decision that again was blamed on the European Union.  The European Union Court of Auditors, however, have now informed Members that the closure was unnecessary, that Greencore had decided to close it before the reforms were in place and that there was no valid commercial reason for the company to close that factory.This was a profitable company, like many others the Government has allowed to close, such as SR Technics or the glass bottle companies, because according to the Government, ultimately the market is king.  In this instance, however, it was not the market but speculators who appear to have been king.  Major questions remain outstanding regarding the role of Liam Carroll in this debacle.  It is a pity the Tánaiste is not in the House to answer questions on how Mr. Carroll's investment in Greencore came about.  What did he know beforehand?  In other countries, it is called insider trading when someone knows in advance what a company is doing and buys out a huge number of shares.  These questions have not been answered and the only people who suffered because of it were the Irish people and, in particular, the workers and farmers who worked, supplied and depended upon both the Carlow and Mallow factories.In July 2005, the then Minister, Deputy Coughlan, completely rejected the European Union reform proposals as an attack on the Irish sugar industry.  It is a pity she did not continue with this line.  On 17 November 2005, the then Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, told the Seanad that from Ireland's perspective, the proposals were unacceptable, that the Government would defend Irish sugar and that he was confident the sector would be saved.  Greencore obviously had a different plan and different ideas because it was planning to get out of sugar production.  What then persuaded the Minister to change her mind and to support Greencore and argue the position she took only one month later?  In December 2005, before the European Union had formally ratified the reform agreement, Deputy Coughlan justified the closure in Carlow and referred to what she foresaw as a possible total closure of the sugar industry as a consequence of the European Union's actions.It always has been very easy for the Government to blame the European Union for everything because it lacks the guts to stand up to the European Union or even to examine or challenge its directives.  The Government has been a willing partner in most of the crimes in respect of closures but has blamed the European Union.  Did the Minister know in December 2005 that Greencore was about to close the Mallow plant?  I believe so and this is a charge against the then Minister that she should be in this House to answer.  Even though Members have been told that no one seemed to know and that there was no plan, I encourage the Garda Síochána fraud squad to examine the records and the meetings that Greencore held at that point to ascertain what it was planning, because it is fraud.In December 2005, the then Minister, Deputy Coughlan, promised that in the event of what only she and Greencore foresaw as an inevitability, namely, total closure, handsome compensation would be available.  Greencore certainly benefited and received its compensation to the tune of €100 million.  The company then had to be dragged into the courts by the workers to secure their redundancy payments.  The European Court of Auditors now states that it cost more to close the Irish sugar industry then it would have cost to keep it alive.  When my colleague, Deputy Ferris, questioned the then Minister, Deputy Coughlan, on the generous handout to the Greencore chancers, it emerged that Greencore also received more in compensation than it would have done had it decided to go into bio-fuel production, which would have been an alternative use of the facilities, saved many jobs and helped the farmers in the region.In addition, in Carlow, inspired by that genius of the property market, Liam Carroll and his companies decided that it would be best to build apartments on the site rather than facing the prospect of keeping hundreds of people in employment and giving work to thousands of farmers.  It was always worthwhile destroying the livelihoods of many to benefit property speculators.In reply to my colleague, Deputy Ferris, on 24 October 2006, the then Minister, Deputy Coughlan, again blamed the closure of the plant in Mallow on the European Union.  In the light of the auditors' report, does she accept that this was not an accurate claim?  It was not the fault of the European Union but the fault and responsibility of the then Minister and stemmed from the greed associated with speculation on property and sites for apartments and the like.  If it was not the European Union's fault, why did the Minister defend the Greencore speculators' decision to destroy one of the most successful industries in the country and the livelihoods of hundreds of people who worked in and supplied that industry?The then Minister also waffled about the EU plan requiring restructuring of the sugar industry.  What part of restructuring an industry involves selling the plant, destroying the buildings, sacking the workers, leaving farmers with no one to buy their beet and, worse again, incompetently attempting to cash in on a dying property market by planning, in the case of the plant in Carlow, to build apartments there?Returning to the Greencore restructuring plan, did the then Minister or her officials go to the trouble of examining the EU proposals and their consequences?  They were still only proposals when Greencore decided to close the plant in Mallow, with the then Minister's support.  Did she and the officials who advised her just take what Greencore had stated at face value and swallow its lies hook, line and sinker?  Greencore and its friends are the ones who have destroyed the economy, the consequences of which the Minister, Deputy Smith, his Government colleagues and the rest of us are having to deal with.  Was the then Minister, Deputy Coughlan, totally and utterly incompetent, as has been shown in other cases?  Was she, as the Minister with responsibility for this successful industry, simply hoodwinked by Greencore?  This was a public company before it was sold to failed compulsive gamblers.  This is the consequence of selling public companies which are profitable.  We all make mistakes and can be duped from time to time.  If that is what happened, the then Minister should have the courage to come to the House and admit to the hundreds of former workers now living on the dole that her decision was wrong, rather than hide behind the mythical claim that the European Union was responsible.Yesterday Deputy Rabbitte compared the last days of this Government to the last days of the Roman Empire.  They are more akin to the last days of Al Capone and Owney Madden or Lucky Luciano.  That would be a better analogy, given what has emerged time and again in this House——

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	744	Let me refer to what the Minister said in his opening remarks.  He said that, even though the Government held a special share in Greencore following its establishment in 1991, the Minister of the day had had no say in operational matters.  Given all that has been explained today, what was the value of having a special share if the Minister was not allowed to defend the strategic importance of a sector or industry?  In view of this and on foot of the independent report which poses serious questions, is the Minister prepared to sit down with the European Commission and re-evaluate the sugar beet industry?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	745	I totally reject the argument that every effort was not made to protect the Irish sugar industry.  Every effort was made.  Greencore made the decision to renounce the quota, not the Government.To answer Deputy Doyle's first question, the special share in Greencore did not allow the Minister, acting on behalf of the State, to contribute to the decision made by Greencore on the renunciation of the quota.  The proposed actions by Greencore that required the Minister's consent under the terms associated with the special share were related to any changes to certain specified articles of the articles of association; the voluntary winding up of Greencore; the sale of more than 49% of Irish Sugar plc, a subsidiary of Greencore; and the creation of a new class of shares in Greencore.  Legal advice obtained at the time was that they did not include provision for the Minister to direct Greencore in relation to the sugar quota.  Greencore was the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	747	I have just read them out for the Deputy.  They applied to any changes to certain specified articles of the articles of association of Greencore, the voluntary winding up of Greencore, the sale of more than 49% of Irish Sugar plc and the creation of a new class of shares in Greencore.  At the time the Government obtained legal advice on its ability to participate in the decision made by Greencore.  The decision was entirely one for Greencore.  The Government had no competence, acting as the special shareholder, to make or contribute to a decision on the renunciation of our sugar quota.The Deputy and others mentioned the possibility of recommencing the industry here.  I quickly went through the report earlier today.  The Commission, in its response to the European Court of Auditors' findings, mentions the court's finding that there is stability in the sugar regime and it appears to have no appetite for revisiting the issue of quota.  Greencore, the quota holder, renounced Ireland's quota allocation and compensation was paid to the stakeholders in the industry.  If the Commission was to entertain the idea of a quota allocation for this country, the question of the compensation paid on the renunciation of the quota would arise.  The establishment of a sugar industry in Ireland would be the subject of a commercial decision.  We have received no indication that any company or enterprise is interested in establishing such an enterprise.  We have no indication that any particular company is interested in establishing such an enterprise in this country.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	748	That is on the basis that it is for sugar production only.  The price of sugar has spiked and sugar production in Brazil is at an all time high at the cost of our rain-forests and when we could be producing it.  The auditors' report states that limiting to 85% of EU demand places a constraint on a strategic product, one that goes beyond just sugar.  I challenge the Minister to revisit the matter with the Commission.  The same situation obtained in the case of Mulder milk.  The Minister should revisit the scenario.Previously, money was paid out that did not preclude an issue from being revisited.  The circumstances in this case have changed entirely.  Will the Minister examine the auditors' comments on the 85% acting as an inhibitor in many ways?  This issue goes beyond sugar production, although that element is important in its own right, given the prices.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	749	Regarding the night of 20 February 2006, I understand the difficulty for the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in needing to account for a decision taken in 2006 at a meeting at which he was not present.  Therefore, he is reliant on the officials.  Ideally, the then Minister should be in the Chamber so that we could have a full and frank account of what occurred at the meeting.Why did the Government shift its position?  While we were considering the matter from the perspective of Mallow and the protection of jobs and a viable national industry, there were grounds for hope because of the blocking minority.  The Tánaiste stated it was a group of 14 member states.  I understood that, under the old regime, a blocking minority consisted of nine member states.  Why did the Government shift its position from a blocking minority of nine to acceding to the cessation of trading as an industry?  Something must have happened.  Perhaps a vested interest intervened because it wanted to take the compensation.  This could have been a minority group of larger growers, the Government or even Greencore, which might have decided that it was going to get out of the industry and applied political pressure on the Government to that effect.The question of the golden share and related responsibilities comes into play in this respect.  I understand that the 1990 legislation makes provision for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to acquire a special share in the holding company and to exercise the rights attached to that share.  However, the Minister stated that he had no rights in the context of the share.  Forgive me, as I am not a lawyer or a solicitor, but if the Minister is telling the House that we had a golden share with no rights attached to it in terms of the performance of the company, why did we have a golden share in the first instance?  What was its purpose if we could not influence internal Greencore decisions on the compensation package and the industry's future in Ireland?I will tell the House the reason.  The Government did not care about the future of the industry.  Vested interests had sufficient influence in Government circles to tell it to adopt the new negotiating position of taking the money and running.  If we had the support of the other member states, we could have retained a blocking minority.  If the contrary is the case, then the Minister should tell us.I refer to the stand-alone paragraph which stated that we had a proficient factory — this is obviously a reference to the Mallow factory in point 30 as the Minister has stated.  Has the Minister been in contact with the Commission regarding that specific point of the report?  What has been the Commission's response to the Minister on that matter and on the report in general?  Deputy Jack Wall has already stated that the decision had not been justified on the risk of lower prices reducing the supply of sugar beet to an uneconomic level.  We did not really know what the true market would be, post-restructuring.  My information in 2005 was that Greencore was going to proceed with production and move into a post-quota scenario and then see how the market would pan out.  This was the impression given to me by senior people within Greencore at the time.  In other words, even if the quota regime was not in place, the industry might survive for a year or two in a new market scenario.  If after that time the industry did not survive, there might be a possibility it could diversify into ethanol and other such products.  I ask for the Minister's view at this stage.  Will I be allowed make another contribution later?

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	751	I utterly reject some of the argument put forward by Deputy Seán Sherlock.  The Government was not influenced by any outside forces in its negotiations leading up to the decisions made at the end of November 2005.  Ireland opposed the Commission's proposals in regard to the sugar regime.  The Tánaiste, the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, led a group of 14 member states who worked together and opposed the Commission's proposals.  Not alone did the Tánaiste participate in the group, but she also chaired it.  To my recollection, the group initially comprised 14 members, 13 others plus Ireland.  Subsequently, it reduced to eleven member states, Poland, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Greece, Ireland, Finland, Lithuania, Portugal, Latvia and Slovenia.  Coming to the time the decision was made, that group number had reduced very substantially.  Deputy Sherlock recognised in his contribution that, at the time of the Council meeting, we did not have a blocking minority.  The group had not stayed together.  That was the position.  The then Minister for Agriculture and Food was strongly opposing the Commission's proposals.  In view of the fact that the Commission would have a majority to put forward its proposals, in the event of the Irish quota-holder renouncing Ireland's quota share, the Minister had set about getting the best possible compensation package for all stakeholders in the industry in this country.  That is how the package was negotiated.  It was obvious we did not have the support we needed to oppose and defeat the Commission proposals.  That decision was a Presidency conclusion and there was not a formal vote as such.  One or two member states may have indicated that they were opposed to the proposal.  However, the majority were in favour of the Commission's stance.  It is not recognised that the European Commission was obliged, as a result of decisions taken by the WTO and subsequently by a panel appointed thereby, to reform its sugar regime and that a quantum of 6 million tonnes of sugar had to be removed from the European production system.No one is questioning the efficiency of the Mallow plant.  If I am correct, I understand Greencore had made a substantial investment in the plant not long before the period in question.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	752	That is correct.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	753	In the background to the discussions in question is the fact that the protected price that was available up to the point to which I refer would — on foot of the WTO panel ruling and the European Union's obligations under international trade rules — no longer have been available.  Greencore took a commercial decision to renounce its quota.  When it did so, the then Minister, Deputy Coughlan, quite understandably, expressed her regret at the company's decision to close the factory.  If I am correct with regard to the timeframe, this occurred very late in the season when farmers would have been making preparations in respect of the following season's crops.In the negotiations relating to the compensation package that were under way at that time, the then Minister obtained a proviso that Ireland — if it availed of said package and if Greencore, as the quota holder, was to exit the industry — could still produce sugar for the following two years.  Greencore chose not to take up that option.It is important to reiterate that at every meeting which took place with the Council of Ministers, the EU Commission and the Presidency during the period in question, the then Minister and her officials made available the most up-to-date facts.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	759	The reality is that Greencore took the decision to exit the industry.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	760	No.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	762	The Deputy is absolutely wrong.  I reject that type of nonsensical remark.  Such remarks are not worthy of a Member of this House.  The Deputy should withdraw that baseless comment.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	763	We will not make progress if Members continue to interrupt.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	764	Deputy D'Arcy's comment is baseless in nature and he should withdraw it.  Greencore made the decision to exit the industry.  The then Minister fought for a good package for the various stakeholders in this country.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	765	The then Minister fought for the money.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	766	To what money is the Deputy referring?
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	767	To the money for which the then Minister fought in respect of an exit from the industry.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	768	So the Deputy is stating that the beet growers of County Wexford should not have been compensated.  I am surprised that a Deputy who represents the county would make such a statement.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	769	We are not going to make progress if Members continue to engage in exchanges of this type.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	770	Greencore held the quota share.  I am sure no one is going to seriously suggest that it was not in possession of up-to-date information in respect of its activities.  The situation was changing because the protected price would no longer be available as a result of the WTO's ruling.  I reiterate that the then Minister and her officials had made available the most up-to-date statistics and data relating to the industry in this country before the relevant Commissioner, the then Presidency and the relevant Commission officials at every opportunity.Deputy Sherlock inquired with regard to the special share.  I must inform him that it is not a golden share.  That phraseology is incorrect — it is a special share.Deputy Doyle inquired about the powers conferred on the then Minister at the time.  What was agreed did not confer on her the power to stop Greencore renouncing its quota and exiting the industry.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	771	So the Government stitched up the legislation very well in that regard.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	772	It is very wrong of the Deputy to make such a statement.  I do not accept that anyone in this House would stitch up legislation.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	773	I ask Members to ensure that their questions are brief.  If they do so, everyone will have an opportunity to contribute.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	774	Will the Minister comment on the moot point which has been brought to our attention by the Court of Auditors — this relates to the period prior to the negotiations on compensation — in its special report?  It is stated in the relevant part of the special report that "the impact assessment merely referred to studies which have ranked the sugar-producing regions according to the combined profitability of growers and producers, categorising the regions as: low, medium and high".  The report further states:The ranking was based on 2001 data for the EU sugar industry.  However, the data had not been updated when the Commission made its proposal in 2005, notwithstanding that certain significant changes had taken place, such as increases in sugar beet yields in Spain and the United Kingdom and producer consolidation/rationalisation in Ireland.This goes to the nub of the issue.  Will the Minister comment on this matter?  Is he stating that the Court of Auditors is completely wrong in its observation that the initial decision was based on out-of-date information?  The decision to which I refer established the conditions in which all subsequent decisions were made and actions taken.I wish to pose two further brief questions.  Deputy Ned O'Keeffe stated earlier today that it would cost in the region of €40 million to establish a new plant.  Does the Minister agree with that assertion?  Will the Minister comment on the cost of importing sugar into this country?  I understand that last year approximately €99 million worth of sugar was imported.  Costs relating to molasses, transport and possibly ethanol are not included in that figure.  Has the Minister given consideration to this aspect of the matter?  My main question, however, relates to whether he agrees with the findings in the special report.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	775	The reply by the Commission——
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	776	I asked about the special report of the Court of Auditors, not the Commission's reply.  What is the Minister's view of the special report produced by the Court of Auditors?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	777	One at a time, please.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	778	I am replying.  Deputy Stanton cannot ask a question and then seek to answer it as well.  I wish to quote from the reply by the Commission to the findings of the special report of the Court of Auditors.  The Commission stated:For reasons of efficiency and transparency, the Commission opted for a reform model in which the final decisions for keeping, reducing or abandoning production would be taken by individual sugar companies, against the background of a future characterised by substantially lower prices.I referred earlier to the protected price regime and the fact that it was to be abolished on foot of the WTO decisions taken at the time and international trading obligations.  The latter were agreed and the European Union was involved in the process relating to them.  In its reply, the Commission also states:Moreover, such an analysis would concern confidential aspects of private business, and comparisons between companies based thereon would not be exempt from controversy.  The gains in competitiveness of the EU sugar industry after the reform are incontestable since operating companies now have to maintain profitability in a scenario of substantially lower institutional prices.Again, this relates to the protected price.I did not hear the comments made by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe on the news earlier today.  I stand open to correction but I understand that when Greencore decided to renounce the quota the then Minister and the Department put to the company the proposal in respect of the possible establishment of an ethanol-processing facility at the site in Mallow.  It was Greencore which decided not to proceed with such a project.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	779	When was that?
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	780	Is the special report of the Court of Auditors right or wrong?  The Minister never answered the question I posed.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	781	I did.  The special report of the Court of Auditors does not relate to our case, it relates to the European Commission.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	782	Time is limited.  We must move on.  I call Deputy Moynihan.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	783	The Minister did not answer my question.  He could have given a simple "Yes" or "No".
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	784	The decision on the part of Greencore to close the plant in Mallow was a massive blow to local farmers, the employees at the plant and the wider community.  Greencore refused to make redundancy payments to the employees and developed a plan to build, on the site of the plant, what would ostensibly have been satellite town adjacent to Mallow.  It was as a result of what it proposed in this regard that the company closed the factory.When Greencore exited the industry in 2006 and closed the plant, there was a great deal of discussion regarding the establishment of another industry on the site.  It was suggested that instead of producing sugar, the plant would be used to process a different product from sugar beet.  There has been a great deal of discussion on local radio and elsewhere today with regard to the possibility of establishing another industry at the site.  Is there any truth to what has been stated in this regard?  Does such a possibility exist?There is a great deal of misinformation abroad with regard to what happened and what decisions were taken during the discussions which took place at European Commission level prior to the negotiations to which the Minister referred.  The Minister stated clearly the decisions which were taken and the information which was put on the record of the Commission by the Tánaiste and her officials.  It will be very helpful for everyone to have the information about the arguments which were put to try to ensure Ireland continued to produce sugar on a long-term basis.  Based on what the auditors came out with in recent days, irrespective of where we are, if the correct information had been available, would it have made a substantial difference to the decision to cease production of sugar in Ireland and wipe out an industry which had been of major benefits to communities in north Cork, Carlow and elsewhere over the years?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	785	In regard to the latter part of Deputy Moynihan's question, one of the responses of the Commission on the auditors' report states:The total level of quota renunciation estimated by the Commission is not based on the analysis of the profitability of individual companies but the result of the new macroeconomic conditions prevailing in sugar economics and the European Union, namely, the WTO panel decision and the increased access granted to certain sugar exporters.The regime that existed at the time in regard to the sugar industry was put in place in 1968.  The sugar quota was in existence before the milk quota.  I do not know whether other quota regimes were introduced subsequently.  The milk quota regime was introduced in 1984-85.  Considerable pressure was put on the European Union to rationalise or reorganise the sugar quota regime prior to the discussions at the WTO at the end of December of that year.It was the decision of individual companies to renounce the quota.  The Commission did not decide it.  Greencore made the decision to renounce the quota.  In all the contributions made by the Tánaiste, who was the relevant Minister at the time, she outlined very strongly the history of the sugar industry in this country, its contribution from the point of view of farm incomes, the fact that it was an important crop from an agri-economic point of view and that it provided very valuable employment for those employed directly by the sugar company.  Every aspect of those arguments were put as forcefully as possible to the Commission in Ireland's opposition to its proposals to restructure the quota regime.As I said to Deputy Sherlock, when decision time came at those Council of Ministers meetings, we did not have enough people with us to have a blocking minority.  The decision was going ahead.  When a decision is going to go against one, there is a time to negotiate to get the best possible package put in place in the event of the quota holder renouncing the quota.  Subsequently, Greencore renounced the quota.  Built into the potential compensation package was the fact that it would be available for a further two years but production was still possible after that date.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	786	A number of Deputies wish to speak and I am trying to call on everyone.  There is limited time and I will call the Minister with five minutes of the debate remaining.  I ask Deputies to keep questions short and park the preambles.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	787	This issue centres on whether we accept this report.  The Minister said the Tánaiste worked on it.  Let us leave that to one side.  Was the whole situation not flawed regarding Ireland's fight on this if the information provided was out of date?  Surely if that was the case, we were going nowhere from the start.  We could not win or get friends if that was the situation because obviously we were in a negative rather than a positive situation which weakened our case.  I give the Minister the benefit of the doubt.  I respect his honour.  I ask him to go back to the Court of Auditors to determine the situation regarding the information being out of date and report back to us.When did Greencore decide that was it and that it was not going any further?  Did the Tánaiste know that before she went to Brussels?  Was it decided during the visit?  When was it decided?  Is that the decision the Tánaiste had to renegotiate when she got the information?  Did Greencore have to make a decision when all was done and the package was in place whereby it had to decide to continue on the other side?  Did it make a decision before the final negotiations were finished?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	788	I may have said "The Council of Ministers at the end of 2006", but I should have said "the end of 2005".  The Tánaiste did not know what decision Greencore would take in advance of it announcing its decision.  That is the factual position.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	789	Everyone else knew.  She must have been the only person who did not know.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	790	I cannot answer for any of the Deputies.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I recall the Tánaiste stated she met Greencore on Thursday and received a text message the following Tuesday which stated it was to close the plant.  It had not told her on Thursday.  It is unbelievable.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	792	The compensation package which the Tánaiste negotiated very successfully for the country was put in place in the event of the quota holder deciding to exit the industry.  In regard to Deputy Wall's point, the Court of Auditors report is not about Ireland's role in the sugar quota regime or the rationalisation or restructuring of it, rather it is about the Commission.  It is not directed at us.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	793	It says part of it was out of date.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	794	We are rapidly running out of time.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	795	I will repeat again that the most up-to-date information was available to the Commission.  It was submitted at every Council of Ministers meeting and meetings with the presidency and the relevant Commissioner at the time.  In fairness, none of us would have had time to examine the auditors' report in detail as we would have liked to have done.  There seems to be a view in the House that the Commission should have collected data on the productivity of the 200 sugar factories in existence at the time and picked out the least productive.  That was not the approach taken by the Commission.  It was a voluntary restructuring.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	796	It was a scattergun approach.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	797	Deputies should allow the Minister to speak.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	798	It was a voluntary restructuring approach.  The approach involved the individual producer, that is, the processor or company, rather than the farmer.  They are referred to in the report as "producers" whereas we would call them a processor or company.  On Deputy Wall's question, which he has raised twice, I want to quote the response of the Commission to the report of the auditors.  It is very important from the point of view of efficiency, profitability, etc.  I want to put on the record of the House the success of the industry and the commitment of individual farmers, workers and the different processing plants over the years.  There were plants in places other than Mallow which, unfortunately, closed.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	799	The Minister is trying to hold up time.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	800	I will combine speakers and take two or three people at the same time.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	801	The Commission stated:For reasons of efficiency and transparency the Commission opted for a reform model in which the final decision for keeping, reducing or abandoning production would be taken by individual sugar companies, against the background of a future characterised by substantially lower prices.  In addition, a financial incentive was provided by companies that decided to surrender quota.  This model does not require an analysis of the current profitability and prospects of every individual sugar producer in the EU.  Therefore, the Commission did not consider it necessary to collect such data on productivity and efficiency for the model chosen.  Moreover, such an analysis would concern confidential aspects of private business and comparisons between companies based thereon would not be exempt from controversy.It then goes on to refer to as incontestable the gains in competitiveness of the EU sugar industry after the reform.  That is the reply of the Commission in response to some of the comments of the Court of Auditors.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	802	I will take a number of speakers together, Deputies Ahern, Nolan and D'Arcy.  I ask Deputies to be brief and to the point with no embellishment.  Just ask the questions.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	803	Many of us here were brought up on farms and dealt with beet since the day we were born.  We understand the importance of it to the local economy.  We fought every way we could to ensure that Mallow would be kept open.I am afraid, and I agree with the prognosis, that Greencore decided that it wanted to get out.  When the subsidies went and Carlow was gone, Mallow was too far away from farmers and it was not profitable to do it.There is a need for an explanation of what the Court of Auditors has done, and the Minister is doing that.  It needs to be explained clearly that a mistake was not made there that resulted in what they did.On 14 March 2010, a Deputy colleague of mine, not Deputy Stanton or Deputy Sherlock, on Cork local radio claimed that I signed off on the sugar industry in Cancun in 2003, along with the former Minister, Mr. Joe Walsh, and Mr. John Dillon.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	804	I had forgotten that.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	805	He did it on three occasions then and he did it again today.  It is totally untrue.  It is, in fact, a lie and he refused to withdraw it or correct it.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	806	I stated when Carlow sugar factory closed down, and when Mallow closed down, that it was a disaster.  It was wrong for the country.  It was wrong for the farmers and for the families of the workers.  This was an industry that gave thousands of families and individuals work on a seasonal basis.The elephant in the room is Greencore.  It is not the Minister or the Government.  If Fine Gael was in Government, I would be saying the same.At the time, the Tánaiste, who was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, put on the record a clear explanation of how it went.  Greencore are the mercenaries in this; the company decided it was getting out.  It decided to get out because it wanted compensation but then greed took over.  It saw an opportunity in Carlow.  It brought up this grandiose planned called Gateway, and it did the same in Mallow.  Not alone was it gilding the lily, but it was getting its compensation.  It put Irish farmers and workers out of a profitable industry and denuded the country of a good rotation crop.  It got greedy, and that is where the blame should lie.Does this report give us any scope to go back to the Commission to get a quota and find those, be they farmers and whoever else, who would come into what is a profitable industry and start again in this country?  I think we would find interest in it.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	807	One of the matters I want to inform the Minister about is that no decision was made at the stage that Carlow was closed down regarding the decision of the Commission.  The reality is the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said within a couple of days of her entering that Department that the decision on Carlow would have no impact on the closure of the industry.  When Carlow went, the industry was gone.  It does not matter whether the Minister likes that or not.I agree with some of what Deputy Nolan said.  In my view, however, there was a conspiracy because Greencore saw dollar, euro and pound signs.  The company got the compensation and the then Minister facilitated it.  She made it easy for it to put the steps in place.  With Carlow gone, the only thing left to go was Mallow and that was easy.  Greencore got the money and ran.  The company was going to build towns and all the Government saw at that stage was the tax take from construction and development, and capital taxes and all that goes with it.I am a beet producer who got compensation.  It worked out at less than two years' profit and in the scheme of the things, it was nothing.  The report asked if the reform of the sugar market has achieved its main objectives.  The answer to that is "No", according to the Court of Auditors.  I ask the Minister not to sell out other sectors of Irish agriculture in the same way as he, and his predecessors, sold out the sugar beet industry.

The Minister mentioned the special share.  What was the purpose of that?  Was it merely window dressing to justify the decision in the first place to sell a profitable public company?Given that Deputy Nolan called Greencore mercenaries, and others have made similar allegations about conspiracies, does the Minister accept that the whole saga of the closure not only of Mallow, but also of Carlow, and the involvement of property speculators in that company at key points prior to closure decisions being taken needs a fuller and more detailed investigation than the time that was given to it today?

The best area in the country for growing beet was abandoned.  Would the Minister agree that the alarm bell should have gone off at that stage with his relevant predecessors and some action should have been taken to ensure that the industry was preserved?  Will this also be a lesson for Government in the future in that there must be a relationship between it and important industries?Can the Minister give any hope to farmers in the Wexford, Carlow, Wicklow, Kilkenny and Kildare areas that they might be going back to dealing in a crop that was successful for a few generations?

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13854	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	811	The Everything But Arms Initiative was something of a fallacy in terms of a justification for the Government's position on the loss of an industry which goes back to the foundation of the State.  The Minister, in his justification, weakens his own argument because the Everything But Arms Initiative and the ACP countries have not found the foothold in the European markets that they were supposed to get as a result of the restructuring of the sugar industry.  The bottom line here is that what was a sustainable industry has been sold down the river but it was let go too easily.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	812	This is a simple question.  The answer is either "Yes" or "No".  Does the Minister agree with the auditors' that the ranking, the Commission's decision made in 2005, was based on out of date data?  Does the Minister agree with that statement, "Yes" or "No"?
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	813	Paragraph 91 of the auditors' report states that, although designed to be budget neutral, significant costs have arisen.  The sugar reform was designed to be budget neutral, but the overall cost to the EU budget after the reform for the period 2007–13, which we are half-way through, is likely to be €1.2 billion higher than before the reform.  Therefore, it has failed.  It has not achieved its objectives for the consumer, the developing world producer or the Irish economy.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	814	Most of the points raised cross over.I stated at the outset that the EU was obliged to reform the sugar regime because of a WTO decision and, subsequently, a WTO panel decision.  Europe was required to take a quantum of sugar production out of the system.  That is the background to the Commission driving forward the programme of rationalisation and reorganisation.The Commission, in its reply to the Court of Auditors, states that it takes the view that the new sugar market balance emerging from the reform, including the level of EU self-sufficiency, is in line with treaty provisions, that the treaty does not stipulate that the EU should necessarily be self-sufficient with regard to every agricultural product and that certain instruments built into the sugar regime would enable the EU to deal with situations of under supply.  The Commission also goes on to state that it considers that the reform's objective of reducing the sugar price has been met.  In the background is the decision in WTO, and the subsequent WTO panel decision.I have heard Deputies Michael Ahern, Nolan and Moynihan speak often, as other Members of the House have spoken today and on many other occasions, about the importance of the particular industry not only to their own regions, but to the country in general.  It is very important to reiterate that the quota was not renounced by Greencore — it was the quota holder — and compensation was fully drawn down for all the stakeholders.  There is no mechanism for quota reallocation, even if the compensation issue was addressed if that arose.  This is referred to in the Commission's comments also.It is important to bear in mind that the reform was based on a voluntary restructuring approach by each sugar company.  Greencore went ahead and participated in that restructuring.  With regard to the WTO participation, the area of protected price had changed for the marketplace for the future——

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	825	The reform of the EU sugar regime was a difficult process for all concerned resulting in the closure of a traditional agriculture sector.  It has unfortunately become the subject of this type of debate, much of which is ill informed.  The purpose of the special report of the European Court of Auditors is to consider whether the reform of the sugar market had achieved its main objectives.  As an eminent economist publicly stated, the Court of Auditors criticised the design of the reform on a number of grounds, but to conclude that the Irish industry could have remained viable in this scenario is an exercise in escapism.  That is what an economist stated today following the report.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	832	When the political support opposing the reform dissipated, Ireland secured the most advantageous support package possible.  It has to be borne in mind that the package for all stakeholders was negotiated in the event of a decision being taken by the company involved to exit sugar production.  The decision to cease sugar production was a commercial decision taken by Greencore plc.  It is very important to put that on the record.  The implication that seems to have been drawn is that the Irish plant had the misfortune to be hit by the approach of the Commission.  The situation is — and it is very important — that it was a voluntary scheme and Greencore made the decision to exit the industry——

I have clearly stated that the choice of exiting or staying in production was the decision of each sugar producing company.  Obviously, it was for each company to take that commercial decision.  Earlier, I dealt with the issue of the relevance of the impact assessment carried out by the Commission.  I make it clear again that the Commission had the most up-to-date information on the position in Ireland throughout all of the negotiating process.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	848	On 12 October, the Minister of the Education and Skills announced a Government decision to restructure the VEC system through the amalgamation of the VECs to reduce the number from the current 33 to a proposed 16.  The decision includes the amalgamation of Kerry Education Service, County Kerry VEC, County Limerick VEC and City of Limerick VEC.  The rationale behind the decision, according to the text of the Minister's statement of 12 October, is that it is part of the overall Government agenda to transform how public services are delivered.  The consolidation ensures that each of the 16 VECs will be organisations of sufficient scale to support the evolution of local education service delivery and to meet future challenges.The briefing document indicates that under the proposed revised structure, the smallest VEC will have a budget of €39 million.  I remind the Minister of State that Kerry Education Service had a budget of €40.6 million in 2008 and a budget of €41.4 million in 2009.  The projected outturn for 2010 will be €44 million.  This is way above the guidelines.  Under the proposed revised structure, County Kerry VEC, City of Limerick VEC and County Limerick VEC will have a combined budget in excess of €100 million.Since the amalgamation of Town of Tralee VEC and County Kerry VEC in 1998 when Kerry Education Service was formed, Kerry Education Service has developed a vigorous, modern and progressive education service in the county, supporting and developing schools and reaching into every corner of the county with adult and further education provision.  In 2009, Kerry Education Service provided education for 3,000 second level students and 11,000 further and adult education students.The McCarthy report quoted savings of €3 million but did not take account of the collateral damage, which will be far in excess of that amount when one considers the effect on communities, service users and staff.  If the proposed amalgamation places the headquarters outside of Kerry, the loss of revenue to local businesses in Kerry alone will be in the region of €5 million per year.At present, 1,000 full and part-time staff are employed throughout the county by Kerry Education Service.  Any amalgamation will impact on resources for staffing.  Decisions regarding the allocation of resources for schools and further education programs will not be made in County Kerry.  There will be a loss of school identity in the scheme that will span two counties and 21 schools.  Larger geographical areas for teaching staff will mean that teachers will have to travel further for re-employment or redeployment purposes.  Kerry will also compete for PLC, FETAC, literacy and community education places with a large city such as Limerick and with Limerick regeneration requirements.  Budgets and student places will be allocated without an understanding of the local economy and educational or social needs in many parts of Kerry.  Kerry education service currently has the flexibility to provide quality-assured FETAC programmes throughout the county and this may no longer be possible.  The development of new education initiatives for the county will be at risk.  Special initiatives currently in place in Kerry education services schools such as the development schools and enrichment learning programme may no longer be available.I am completely opposed to this proposal.  There is no evidence of a coherent, thought-out plan and costed strategy focusing on the needs of students and on the needs of Kerry as a community and as a society in times of serious economic stress.The Fine Gael document, Reinventing Government, has been criticised by some people in Kerry — I was attacked about it today by a member of the TUI in Kerry.  On page 83, it is clearly stated that Fine Gael plans to rationalise vocational education committees from 33 to 20 in number but that Kerry would be left on its own.  It is Fine Gael policy that for all the reasons I have outlined, Kerry will be left on its own.  We have lost our industrial independence, our health independence and we will not give up our educational independence as it is one of the last real strengths we have as a county.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	849	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the background to the Government decision to reduce the overall number of VECs.Arising from the recommendation of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes in July 2009, that the number of VECs could be reduced in number from 33 to 22, the Government has decided to reduce the number of VECs from 33 to 16 in order to deal with issues of scale and having regard to the current and prospective requirements of the education sector.  Accordingly, the Government has decided on the merger of particular counties including the merger of County Kerry VEC with County Limerick VEC and City of Limerick VEC.Although a number of indicators could be used to identify the scale of operation of a VEC such as size of budget and number of second level schools, it is fair to say that a VEC's overall budget is the broadest measure of activity because it includes adult education and other provisions not easily captured otherwise.With regard to County Kerry VEC, County Limerick VEC and City of Limerick VEC, the position is that at present, each of these has an overall budget of less than €40 million.  County Kerry VEC has a budget of €37 million; County Limerick VEC has a budget of €39 million while the budget for the City of Limerick VEC is as low as €27 million.  In terms of the number of schools which the VECs operate, County Kerry has eight schools, County Limerick has nine schools and City of Limerick has three schools.  This data reflects a size and scale of operation which is representative of a significant number of existing VECs which makes restructuring of the sector a key priority.The merging of County Kerry VEC with County Limerick VEC and City of Limerick VEC will create a VEC which has the critical mass of activity inherent in an administrative budget of €103 million while retaining the flexibility and adaptability which has characterised the VECs in this area to date.  In arriving at this combination, account was also taken of geographic factors such as the total area covered by the new VEC, the distance between extremities of the area, the road network within the area and the alignment of other regional structures.This new structure will provide the people of County Kerry and the people of County Limerick with a VEC which is designed to better position the sector to support the evolution of service delivery not just in schools under the direct governance of a VEC but in the wider education sector.  This new, larger VEC will be better able to establish shared services and to provide support services to schools not just within the VEC sector but to primary schools and other second level schools in the Kerry and Limerick areas.While the decision involves a significant departure from the present position, where there are one or more VECs in each county, the continuation of strong linkages between the new VEC and the counties that are merged to form it will be a fundamental feature of the new structure.  Each of the counties concerned will have representation on the new VEC committee.  The titles to be given to the new VEC and how it might best reflect the identities of the merging counties of Limerick and Kerry is one of the detailed items that will be covered in the consultations with stakeholders.  The location of the headquarters of the new VEC will be determined later.  This will require engagement by the Department with the VECs concerned.I thank Deputy Deenihan for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	850	I have raised this matter to ensure that the Dublin Adult Learning Centre receives adequate funding to fulfil its mission of providing literacy and basic education to adults in Dublin's inner city.The ethos of the Dublin Adult Learning Centre is quite unique in that it adopts a community-based, learner-centred, creative and holistic approach which is respectful of the adult status of the learner. The centre caters for 660 students per year mostly from the Dublin 1, 3, 7 and 9 postal districts but also from other parts of the city as it is centrally located on bus routes.  Almost half of the students are unemployed with the other 50% being employed often in low-paid jobs but finding it difficult to progress in employment because of their literacy and numeracy problems.  For the majority of learners in the centre, the formal education system has completely failed them.  A total of 47% of the centre's students have just primary school education, while a further 13% have attained junior certificate.  The centre provides one to one tutoring through its highly trained volunteers.  This is very important for people who are embarrassed by their low level of education and lack of basic numeracy and literacy skills.  It also provides the opportunity for students to sit junior certificate, leaving certificate and FETAC levels three, four and five accredited courses.  The majority of students who graduate from the centre's courses go on to further education and many find permanent sustainable employment.Education is indeed the key to unlock the potential of participants, enabling them to pursue employment opportunities.  It also restores dignity to the participants and ensures they can develop as full and active citizens in society.  As one participant pointed out at their pre-budget submission yesterday, learning to read empowered him to exercise one of the most basic yet important civil rights, the right to vote.  Every student in the centre can tell his or her own story as to how participating in a course in the centre helped to transform their lives.The Dublin Adult Learning Centre works with a number of agencies throughout the city.  The centre runs a number of programmes to support its core literacy and numeracy functions, including volunteer tutor training  as the teaching in the centre is done mainly through the work of voluntary tutors, a crèche, a resource room and outreach activities.  Many people volunteer their time, education and skills to give others the same opportunity.The Dublin Adult Learning Centre, like many community education programmes, has been funded to date from a variety of sources.  Two thirds of its funding comes from the Department of Social Protection and the remaining one third comes from FÁS, the Department of Social Protection and from Pobal.  For the past 14 years, the centre received funding from FÁS and the Department of Social Welfare, which represented 19% of the overall budget.  FÁS has now ceased to provide core funding and the Department of Social Protection funding has been transferred into activation funds that are difficult for the centre to access.  The net impact is that the centre has already suffered a loss of almost one fifth of its income before the budget.  It cannot take any further cuts.I ask the Minister to make funding available to compensate for the loss of the FÁS and the Department of Social Protection funds.  It makes no sense to cut funding for an agency that provides such essential education services during a recession with the highest unemployment in the history of the State.  Funding for the centre is an investment in our citizens.  It is clear from the history of the Dublin Adult Learning Centre that this investment will pay dividends in the future.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	851	I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague Deputy Seán Haughey, Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning.  I thank Deputy Costello for raising this issue.The acquisition of adequate literacy skills is necessary for adults to derive any benefit from any education or training course they want or need to engage in. Adult literacy, in addition to reading and writing, now extends to such basic education as numeracy, social and personal development, learning to learn and IT skills.  I refer to those generic skills that enable people to deal with challenges that spring up without warning, the core skills that enable people to exercise judgment or to think laterally; and the key competencies that enable innovation and creativity.  In effect, we need to give people skills for life and these skills will enable them to make their own choices about what they want to do with their lives.Adult literacy has been a priority in further and adult education for some years.  During the past decade the level of Government investment in literacy programmes has tripled from €10 million to €30 million per annum.  The level of participation has also increased from 17,000 annually to almost 50,000.  Despite our economic difficulties, we have managed to maintain funding at consistent levels in recent years at €30 million which the Minister of State will endeavour to maintain in the years to come.As the Department has funded adult literacy programmes for many years, it has funded the Dublin Adult Learning Centre which provides adult literacy and basic education services for adult learners in the north inner city from its base in Mountjoy Square.  The Department's funding is channelled through City of Dublin VEC.  In 2009 the Department provided more than €1 million, which level of funding was maintained in 2010.  In addition, the centre will receive approximately €400,000 this year from FÁS under the community employment scheme, the aim of which remains as an active labour market programme, with the emphasis on progression into employment or further education and training.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration being given to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  In the centre, the scheme aims to provide literacy and communication skills for long-term unemployed persons in the north inner city.The Minister of State wants to acknowledge the important role played by the main provider of literacy tuition, the VECs, and wishes to acknowledge the work done by the staff of the centre.  While we have maintained funding during the years, we have not stood still.  We have developed and enhanced the service.  New awards have been developed at levels 1 and 2, while awards at levels 3 and 4 have been revamped and updated.  Core skills and key competencies are fundamental parts of these new and updated awards.A nationwide adult guidance service, located in and operated by VECs, is available.  It is targeted at those learners who need our adult literacy and other adult education programmes.  The Department has also funded family literacy initiatives across the country which provide inter-generational learning opportunities.  It funds intensive literacy options and workplace-based literacy schemes which seek to engage with low qualified workers who may be vulnerable to unemployment.  There are specially targeted literacy programmes for those in need of particular literacy services, for example, deaf people, people with dyslexia and native Irish speakers in Gaeltacht areas.  We also fund specific programmes for refugees providing literacy and other basic education programmes to assist them integrate into Irish society.  Funding has also been provided for NALA to develop a number of television series promoting literacy services and highlighting the needs of learners.Another positive development for Ireland is our participation in the OECD programme for the international assessment of adult competencies.  The Central Statistics Office is acting as the national project manager and the field trial has gone very well in terms of response rates.  The results of the survey are scheduled to be available in 2012 or 2013.The Minister of State wishes to emphasise the Government's commitment to the provision of literacy opportunities for learners and will continue to fund the sector as resources permit.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	852	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter on the Adjournment.  For many elderly citizens who see their home help as a lifeline to some comfort in the autumn of their lives, this issue is critical.  The security of knowing there is someone there for them on a regular basis improves their health and well-being and is as good as or better than a lot of the medicines they might take.  There is a social dimension to the home help visit which impacts positively on the physical condition of the recipient.Allowing thousands of elderly people to stay in their own homes with the support provided saves the State money by freeing up costly beds in hospitals and nursing homes and is also the policy of the Government.  However, as result of the drastic reduction in the number of home help hours, the Government is not making adequate resources available to implement its own policy and in so doing will cost the State millions of euro in the future.  If matters stay as they are, many of the people concerned will end up in acute beds in district hospitals or nursing homes.In my constituency of Mayo 50,000 hours were targeted to be cut in 2010.  The HSE advises that anyone who needs home help will not be denied, but once the criteria for what constitutes a need are changed, it will be able to come up with any figure it wants to justify it.  Most people who had had their hours reduced in recent months after a review had been given the all-clear less than nine months ago.  If they were approved then, why has the position changed since?  The truth is that the well-being of elderly citizens is at the bottom of the agenda and the only show in town is cutting the services available to the most vulnerable in society.I will give a couple of examples to highlight the unfairness being visited on some of my constituents as a result of the cut in home help hours allocated.  An 87 year old lady who is bent to the ground with arthritis and totally dependent on her home help for everything had the time cut from one hour a day to 45 minutes twice a week.  Her home help is expected or entitled to walk out after 45 minutes, even though it takes 1.5 hours to do all that is needed to be done, especially when she is visited only twice a week.  Let me add that the home help is providing that service on a voluntary basis.Another person in my constituency who has Alzheimer's disease and is living on her own has had her home help hours cut from five per week to 2.5.  Her home help is greeted with human faeces around the house, yet she is not allowed to do any housework or cleaning.  The new criteria are so stringent that they are in no way capable of taking account of the human cases dealt with.The concept of providing home help for elderly people in need of care living in their own home is a good one.  However, because of the inadequate resources provided to implement the scheme, it now poses a threat to the well-being of the very people it sets out to protect.  The Ombudsman stated earlier this week that the State had failed for many years to provide people with their legal right to nursing home care.  If the issue of cutbacks in home help hours is not addressed immediately, it is inevitable the same conclusion will be reached as regards the care of the elderly in their homes.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	853	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on Government policy on the home help service and community services generally for older people.The guiding principle of Government policy in this area is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This policy is delivered through a range of community-based supports such as home help-home care packages, meals on wheels and day and respite care services.  The importance attached to these services is highlighted by the fact that between 2006 and 2010 more than €200 million in additional funding was provided for the HSE to develop such supports for older people.  Without these initiatives, many older people would spend longer than necessary in acute hospitals or be admitted to residential care earlier than might be required.  Home care services are provided either directly by the HSE or in partnership with the community and voluntary sector, or by arrangement with private providers.The home help service is one of our core community services, enabling vulnerable people to remain at home.  It is a critical support for older people, in particular, and facilitates prompt discharge from acute hospitals or prevents inappropriate admissions to such hospitals or long-stay residential care.  Significant progress has been made in developing the service since 2006, with a noticeable impact both on the number of people benefiting and in relieving pressures on the wider health system.The provision has increased from 10.8 million hours in 2006 to 11.97 million in 2009.  This corresponds to an increase from approximately 49,600 clients at the end of 2006 to 53,800 recipients at the end of 2009.  The executive is committed to achieving its target of 11.98 million hours this year in respect of some 54,500 clients, as set out in its current service plan.  The national target for 2010 for home help hours is unchanged from the 2009 figure of 11.98 million hours.  Any change to this commitment would have to be notified to the Department of Health and Children.Despite the serious economic constraints experienced in recent times, we have continued to prioritise improving community services for older people.  This commitment is demonstrated by the €10 million additional funding provided in the last budget to expand home care packages nationally.  These packages often contain a significant home-help component.In addition to the mainstream home help provision, the current service plan is designed to deliver home care packages to approximately 9,600 people at any one time or some 13,000 clients over the course of the year.  This represents an increase for this initiative on that provided for last year.  The plan also provides for 21,300 day-care places which should facilitate up to an estimated 80,000 people.  Other important initiatives in the area of home care supports are also being undertaken.  Arising from an evaluation of home care packages, commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and published last December, the HSE has progressed this year with various improvements in home care provision for roll-out during 2011.  These initiatives include revised national guidelines for standardised implementation of home care packages, new national quality guidelines for home care support services, national guidelines for the home help service, and a national procurement framework for home care services.  The executive went to tender with the procurement framework on 22 October.The HSE has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including the home help service at both regional and local health office levels.  Reviews of service delivery are ongoing to ensure those who most need the service receive it, that the changing care needs of clients are taken into account, that people are treated equitably and that services are managed in a way that reflects seasonal changes in demand.  The HSE has confirmed that services are being closely monitored to ensure the targets for service delivery in 2010 as set out in the service plan will be achieved.  Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect the services referred to by the Deputy, respond to priority demographic and other needs and support ongoing reform of the public health services within available resources.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	854	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  At a number of recent community and constituency meetings as well as at my constituency information clinics, grave concerns have been raised by citizens about the recent proliferation of gold shops and gold trader operations across the Dublin region which seem to be linked to the recession and current economic climate.  I understand the issue also featured recently on the "Liveline" radio programme when residents from throughout Ireland highlighted the recent huge upsurge of gold trading operations and widespread advertisements in the national and local press.I acknowledge that an overwhelming number of jewellery shops and businesses are involved in legitimate buying and selling of jewellery and other gold items but on-street and door-to-door gold operations are causing serious disquiet among many citizens.  Some of my constituents believe gold jewellery and other items stolen in the recent upsurge in robberies and house burglaries are turning up in some of these operations.The media have highlighted the huge increase in house break-ins in certain urban areas.  The most recent third quarter CSO statistics highlighted a 21% increase in the number of robbery, extortion and hijacking offences.  There was a slight decrease of 16% in the number of burglaries in the third quarter but this came on the back of a one third increase in the number of robberies in the second quarter of 2010.  It is clear that the levels of robberies and burglaries remain unacceptably high.Many reputable and legitimate businesses are involved in the trading of gold jewellery but the mushrooming of gold trading operations has given rise to many questions.  Is the Minister of State concerned about the apparent lack of regulation of the trade in gold jewellery?  There have been many disastrous examples of the lack of regulation of various industries under this Government, including the taxi, banking, financial and building industries, and the Government should act quickly to address this issue.Citizens have asked me if a licensing procedure has been put in place for the establishment and operation of gold shops, on-street or door-to-door gold trading operations.  Can anyone establish a gold trading operation, even if he or she has a past conviction for handling stolen property?  Do any legal requirements apply for the establishment of a gold trading operation, whether mobile or in a premises?  If there is no licensing regime, why will the Government not urgently establish one?  Legitimate gold businesses would have no problem with this as it would exclude unscrupulous traders.I hope the Government will consider introducing a system of invigilation to make it easier to track items of jewellery and other gold products received by businesses in response to allegations that stolen property may be turning up in shops.  Have procedures been put in place to compel gold vendors to show that their products have been legally acquired where gardaí doubt their legal provenance?  I understand that some shops have asked and continue to ask an individual selling them items to produce identification.  Perhaps the Government would consider making the sale of any gold item dependent on a copy of valid identification being kept on the purchaser's records.  Many businesses depend on proof of identity.  How can the Garda address the problem of robberies and burglaries if gold jewellery trading operations can operate with impunity?  The Garda should be asked to conduct spot checks of gold trading operations for jewellery and other gold items stolen in house burglaries.The lack of regulation of the trade in gold jewellery is damaging legitimate traders and causing concern in communities.  A licensing system for gold traders, identification of gold vendors and regular spot checks by the Garda are key elements for the regulation of this mushrooming trade.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	855	I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, to update the House on it.  Deputies will be aware of a significant increase in the number of cash for gold outlets in towns and cities in the State and in the advertising for the direct mailing of gold to such outlets or to dedicated postal and Internet cash for gold traders.  It is understood that many kiosks situated in hotels or shopping centres are operated by individuals employed by registered companies to buy gold for cash.  It appears that most gold offered to these outlets is paid for on a scrap value basis and items are smelted and recycled.  Established jewellers also buy gold and jewellery for cash.  The prevalence of this trade appears to be linked to the high price that gold now commands on international markets and the cash for gold concept appears to be an international phenomenon.There has been a considerable amount of media coverage of the activities of these cash for gold outlets, much of which has involved speculation as to the source of the gold being offered.  The Minister is aware that the trade gives rise to concerns in communities about burglaries and other crimes that may be linked to the cash for gold trade.The informal purchase of jewellery is not specifically regulated in criminal legislation but the circumstances under which jewellery is bought and sold may indicate the commission of certain offences, such as the handling or possession of stolen property under sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  Section 17 of that Act provides that a person is guilty of handling stolen property if he or she, knowing that the property was stolen or being reckless as to whether it was stolen, dishonestly receives or arranges to receive it or undertakes or assists in its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person or arranges to do so.  A person guilty of handling stolen property is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or both.  Section 18 of the Act provides that a person who, without lawful authority or excuse, possesses stolen property knowing that the property was stolen or being reckless as to whether it was stolen is guilty of an offence.  A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.In the context of money laundering and terrorist financing legislation, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 only addresses a situation where a person buys gold and jewellery from a dealer, usually a jeweller, and pays in cash to the value of €15,000 or more or makes a number of separate purchases for smaller amounts to that total value.  In such cases, significant requirements are placed on the vendor to carry out customer due diligence.The Garda enforces the provisions of the criminal law in respect of the theft and robbery of jewellery and gold.  Should members of the public have suspicions that goods being sold or traded may be stolen, the correct action is for these suspicions to be referred to the Garda for investigation.The latest CSO crime statistical bulletin of 28 October 2010 indicates that with regard to burglary in quarter three of 2010, there were 6,016 recorded burglary and related offences, which represents a decrease of 1,194, or 16.6%, on the number recorded in quarter three of 2009.  The annualised total for these offences up to end of quarter three of 2010 saw a smaller percentage decrease of 2.9% over the 12-month period to end of quarter three of 2009.  Aggravated burglary offences decreased by 37, or 10.1%, in this 12-month period.  The total recorded burglary and related offences for the years 2007 to 2009 are 23,603 in 2007, 24,683 in 2008 and 26,911 in 2009.To take account of concerns about the matter, the Minister's Department has formally asked the Garda Commissioner to state his view on the extent, if any, of criminal offences that are being committed in the procurement and receipt of gold and similar items in transactions carried out at cash for gold locations.  In particular, the Commissioner has been asked to examine whether the trade may be linked generally, or in particular areas, to burglary offences; whether criminal justice legislation, particularly the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, is adequate in the context of cash for gold transactions; whether criminal elements involved in organised crime or otherwise may be connected with the operation and ownership of the cash for gold outlets; and whether new legislative provisions may be required to address criminality in respect of cash for gold transactions.  As soon as the outcome of this examination of the matter is to hand, the Minister will make an assessment of what if any action, legislative or otherwise, may be required.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	856	I propose to take Question Nos. 11, 16 and 28 together.The Revised Estimates for 2010 allocated €14.6 billion for the HSE. Government expenditure for 2010 was determined in the context of very challenging economic circumstances.   At the end of September the HSE is reporting a deficit of €102m in the hospital sector along with a €27m deficit in community services. This is an improvement on the end August figures.  The results for the individual regions at the end of September are being provided in tabular form to the House.  These are interim figures which are still subject to validation.  The HSE is also forecasting lower than expected expenditure in areas such as demand led schemes, H1N1 vaccination costs and some national programmes.The actions being taken by the HSE in all regions are focused onprotecting front-line services and in particular emergency services;maintaining the quality and safety of services; anddelivering to service plan targets.The principal measures being employed involve:reducing pay and non-pay costs;controlling absenteeism;redeployment of corporate/support staff to frontline roles;implementing measures to ensure that hospital care is delivered as  efficiently as possible;improved bed utilisation and discharge planning; andprocurement initiatives.The HSE is driving efficiency in the acute hospital system by increasing the proportion of surgery undertaken on a day basis, increasing the admission of inpatients on their day of surgery and reducing length of hospital stay consistent with patients' clinical needs. Overall, activity in the acute hospitals is ahead of the Service Plan targets and measures have to be taken to bring elective activity back to target levels where this is necessary to address the projected deficit.Measures are underway to expedite the collection of private patient income and targets have been set for hospitals in this regard.  The receipt of this income will contribute to tackling the projected deficit. The HSE has put the following specific measures in place to increase the cash collection to the end of 2010:Set specific targets for each acute hospital for increased submission of private insurance claims for the final 3 months of 2010. Weekly monitoring of progress to year end in this regard is being undertaken.Following up private insurance claims which have been submitted but not yet settled. Any outstanding queries in relation to such claims are being addressed as a matter of urgency.Prioritise backlogs of outstanding claims that are awaiting submission.Specifically in the HSE Western Region, the latest indications are that it has reduced its projected end year deficit from €130 million at the end of March to €40m at the end of September. In order to address the remaining excess, the HSE West needs to achieve further reductions of €10-€12 million a month for the rest of the year.Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect patient services, to respond to priority demographic and other needs and to support ongoing reform of the public health services within the resources available for health.  To achieve this, staff at all levels will have to work together to deliver services in a more flexible way.  Without that co-operation and flexibility, services to patients cannot be protected.  It is not just for HSE management to protect services: there is a responsibility on everyone involved to deliver services within budget in new ways that will better serve patient needs in accordance with international practice.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	857	The HSE continues to focus on a system wide approach to improving access to hospital.Each day, approximately 30% of the people who visit an Emergency Department will require an admission into hospital. However, it is equally important to note that the majority of patients do not require admission to the hospital as a result of their visit. Of this group, 94% are seen, treated and discharged within 6 hours. This means that the vast majority of Emergency Department attendees are processed and discharged within a reasonable time.As regards waiting lists for elective care the median wait time for a procedure is now 2.6 months, compared to 3.5 months in 2007.  For 19 of the 20 most common adult surgical operations, patients are treated within two to five months.  Children also receive treatment for the ten most common surgical procedures within two to five months. There has been a fall in the number of people waiting for surgical procedures from 7.4 per 1,000 population in 2002 to 3.7 per 1,000 in 2009.  Improving access to hospital services requires a wider healthcare approach.  In recognition of this the HSE has undertaken a number of initiatives.These initiatives include the Winter Initiative Programme, the Code of Practice for Integrated Discharge Planning and actions to reduce the number of delayed discharges, including the introduction of the "Fair Deal".Other innovations undertaken by the HSE include the development of Emergency Care Networks and regionally governed services such as Acute Medical and Surgical Assessment Units, Rapid Access Clinics and Minor Injury Units.Another important initiative has been the establishment of Community Intervention Teams (CITs) which provide follow-up care for medical patients in their own home, allowing the patient to return home from hospital at the earliest opportunity.I have asked the HSE to ensure that patients attending Emergency Departments are seen as quickly as possible, and the HSE is committed to bringing this about.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	858	It is important to use caution when comparing staffing levels of hospitals.  Different criteria must also be considered in making any such comparisons, including the catchment area served, the population and number of patients attending and the availability of other radiological services to patients locally.There are currently 5.54 adult consultant radiologists and 2 paediatric consultant radiologists at Tallaght Hospital.  An additional 2 locum consultant radiologists were appointed to the hospital in January 2010 to assist in dealing with the backlog of X-rays.  The backlog has been cleared and currently there are 0.54 locums in post at the hospital.  However, on 7 September 2010 the HSE issued formal approval to Tallaght Hospital to appoint two new consultant radiologists. This is in line with the recommendations of the Hayes Report.  Interviews are expected to take place next month and the two successful candidates will take up duty as soon as possible in 2011.The Hayes Report recommended that consultant radiologist staffing levels should be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to the work load in each radiology department.  The HSE is committed to carrying out a review of consultant radiologist staffing levels in hospitals and to strengthening workforce planning across all radiology departments.  The review will be informed by the results of a survey of consultant radiologist staffing which is currently being undertaken by the Faculty of Radiology.  The aim is to complete this study by the end of the year.The HSE is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Hayes report as soon as possible.  I am confident that adopting this approach will help ensure the provision of a timely and quality radiology service in Tallaght Hospital.

This represents an increase of approximately €35m on the previous capital envelope for the period to 2013.  It also confirms that the annual capital funding allocation of €400m for health will continue to 2016.The Health Service Executive's current capital plan covers the five year period 2010-2014.  The HSE has published on its website details of the projects which it intends to deliver within this plan.  The HSE will submit its updated capital programme for the next rolling five year period, 2011-2015, to me before the end of this year.The Executive, in conjunction with my Department, is also exploring alternative means of financing improved health infrastructure.    Options include leasing arrangements and the reinvestment of the sale proceeds of asset disposals.With regard to my Department's Vote, capital funding will continue to be provided for health research through the Health Research Board.  This funding will include support for the joint delivery with the Wellcome Trust and others of clinical research facilities at St. James's Hospital and Galway University Hospital.  Capital funding will also be provided to support the requirements of directly funded agencies under the aegis of my Department.In relation to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, there has been considerable investment in childcare places in recent years primarily through the capital grant aiding of construction and refurbishment of childcare facilities.  This investment has greatly improved the availability and quality of childcare options.  Capital funding will continue to be provided to meet existing capital commitments including those under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.

The vaccination schedule requires that three doses of the vaccine be provided at intervals over a period of six months.  From this initial phase 1,581 first year girls were eligible for the free vaccination of which 1,299 received the vaccine. This gives an uptake rate of 82% for the first dose. In July, of those 1,299 girls due a second dose of the vaccine 1,036 received it or 80%.  Those girls who were unable to receive their second dose of vaccine in July were offered this when the schools programme continued in September.  The third dose is being given this month, as per the vaccination schedule to those girls who received the second dose.The second and main phase of the HPV vaccination programme has been underway in 575 schools since September.  HPV vaccine has been offered to approximately 58,000 girls, covering those in second year and those who entered first year this year.  All 32 local health areas have completed the first dose of HPV vaccinations in all 575 secondary schools.  Preliminary figures show that 46,783 girls have received HPV vaccine since September. This provides an uptake rate of over 80%.The HSE is also making arrangements to offer appointments for those girls who were unable to be vaccinated at the initial school visit due to being absent, unwell or did not have the consent form completed, to attend clinics in local HSE health centres.The programme will continue annually with vaccine being offered to all girls in first year in secondary school each year.

Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	862	The Health Act 2004 provided for the establishment of the Health Service Executive with its own Vote and Accounting Officer with effect from 1 January 2005. The HSE is providing thousands of services to young and old, in hospitals, health facilities and in communities across the country. These services range from public health nurses treating older people in the community to caring for children with challenging behaviour; from educating people how to live healthier lives, to performing highly-complex surgery; from planning for major emergencies, to controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The establishment of the HSE represented the beginning of the largest programme of change ever undertaken in the Irish public service. Prior to this our health care services were delivered through a range of different independent agencies. It was a complex structure that made it difficult to provide nationally consistent health services. The decision of the Government to replace all these agencies with the HSE signalled the start of a new era in Irish health care.  Responsibility for day to day operational issues is a matter for the HSE, as provided for in the Health Act 2004.  This was also the situation in the case of the former health boards.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	863	The HSE uses taxis where it deems this appropriate to help clients, sometimes with accompanying staff, to access health and personal social services.  This enables HSE ambulance vehicles and their staff to be used for emergency or other front-line duties. It is also more cost effective than purchasing and operating a fleet of HSE owned vehicles.My Department has asked the HSE to develop a new set of rules in relation to non-emergency patient transport, in order to ensure a consistent national approach to this issue. In addition the HSE has developed a strategy for the procurement of taxi services which is already being used in the former Eastern Region, with significant financial and quality benefits.  The Executive reports that it achieved a reduction of 7% last year in overall patient transport costs in 2009 and that further cost reductions are being achieved this year.Quality of service and patient safety are very important considerations affecting the HSE's use of contracted transport services, such as taxi services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I am advised that overall absenteeism levels in the public health service have reduced from 5.76% in 2008 to 5.03% in 2009 and to 4.76% for the year to August.The HSE has set absenteeism as a key results area (KRA) and effective attendance management is central to cost containment planning and people management throughout the sector. The HSE actively manages absenteeism on a local basis and has comprehensively monitored this indicator on a national basis since 2008. It is clear that these steps are delivering positive results. The HSE has set a national target of a 3.5% rate as the benchmark for all hospitals/agencies and functions across the health sector and staff categories.  Latest data shows that many hospitals, local health offices and voluntary agencies are currently achieving this target or making progress towards it.  High level data by year, by staff category and trends therein since 2008 are as follows:Absenteeism through illness is a normal incidence of working life and an analysis of this data indicates that a substantial majority (in the order of 85%) is certified by medical practitioners.  There is a comprehensive set of management tools and robust engagement on absenteeism with staff, with the objective of ensuring the necessary supports and interventions are available to reduce the impact of non-attendance to the delivery of services and to assist staff return to work in a timely and effective manner in both the interests of staff and services.While it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost of absenteeism to an organisation, the HSE estimates that the payroll costs of absenteeism is approaching €300 million, or almost €60 million for each 1% of absenteeism.Neither my Department nor the HSE collates data in relation to absenteeism in the private sector.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	865	Overtime expenditure for the public health service in 2009 was approximately €310 million. Overtime expenditure in September 2010 (latest data) is approximately €23 million and cumulative year to date is approximately €211 million compared to €234 million to September 2009. If overtime to end year was maintained at September levels, total expenditure for 2010 would be approximately €279 million.  The level of funding available for the health budget is being considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2011 which is currently underway. Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.    However, the very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure and I believe there will have to be a particular focus on areas of non-core pay spending such as overtime.In relation to my Department, due to careful management of overtime budgets during 2009 and 2010, a saving of approximately €200,000 will be made over the original allocations.  The table sets out this information:AllocationOutturnSaving€€€2009300,000203,000 (actual expenditure)97,0002010300,000200,000 (estimated expenditure)100,000Under the Public Service Agreement my Department has committed to examining existing shift patterns and overtime costs during 2011 with a view to providing future services at the best possible value to the taxpayer.

Three pilot sites were identified — Counties Sligo, Mayo and Offaly — and links were fostered between the District Veterinary Offices, the HSE Local Health Managers and in Offaly, the Offaly Local Development Company.  As a result of this work, a model of good practice has been agreed which will be used at regional level where the need arises to support farmers experiencing social or health related issues.The HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) supports a number of programmes and initiatives relating to suicide prevention within the farming and rural communities including the National Farm TV Mental Health Awareness Campaign, the Rural and Farm Stress Helpline and the Veterinary Assistance Programme.  The ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) and SafeTalk training programmes have also been provided to key groups working and living in rural communities.NOSP is taking the lead in relation to a wider programme of work with key stakeholders to address the issue of mental health and suicide within the farming sector.  The aim of the programme is to identify mechanisms through which existing resources, programmes or new initiatives can be interlinked and intensified, and the first stakeholder meeting will be held in December 2010.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	868	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 60 and 63 together.On 1 November 2010 I announced that the Government has decided to approve a voluntary early retirement scheme and a voluntary redundancy scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service.The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform. The Government has decided that funding of up to €400m will be made available in 2010 to fund the up-front costs of both schemes.This is not the first initiative aimed at reducing numbers. The number of management and administrative staff, for example, has already fallen by over 1,000 since its peak in September 2007.  The Incentivised Early Retirement Scheme, introduced by Government in May 2009, was also available to these grades although the uptake was affected by industrial action which resulted in the suspension of the scheme between June 2009 and February 2010.The VER and VR schemes are open to management and administrative staff and general support staff but priority will be given to management and administrative grades. The exact grades covered by the two schemes are set out in detail in the relevant Circular (Circular 7/2010).  There is general acceptance of the need to reduce the numbers of management and administrative staff in the health service. For that reason, all applications from management and administrative staff to avail of the schemes will be approved.  Approval for applications from support staff will depend on the numbers of management and administrative staff who apply and the overall cap on costs not being breached.  I am happy to say that there has been a very high level of interest in the new schemes.  As of Wednesday 10 November there had been over 8,550 expressions of interest.  However it is not possible to predict, as yet, to what extent the current level of inquiries will translate into actual applications ahead of the closing date of 19 November.  The HSE already has a process in place to track and monitor applications around the country and across services which will allow it to identify areas where service gaps may emerge and to address them.  The HSE and health service employers will be looking to the provisions of the Croke Park agreement to ensure they continue to deliver services with reduced numbers and I understand that an engagement with the relevant trade unions has already begun.While the implementation of the schemes will challenge the health service over the coming months, I believe that it will lead to a more efficient health service in the long term.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	869	Since 2005 there has been a 34% national increase in the numbers of consultant radiologists, from 183 to 245.  Ireland now has a ratio of 1 consultant radiologist per 17,959 population, which is similar to the UK at 1 per 18,040 per population.There are currently 5.54 adult consultant radiologists and 2 paediatric consultant radiologists at Tallaght Hospital.  An additional 2 locum consultant radiologists were appointed to the hospital in January 2010 to assist in dealing with the backlog of X-rays.  The backlog has been cleared and currently there are 0.54 locums in post at the hospital.  However, on 7 September 2010 the HSE issued formal approval to Tallaght Hospital to appoint two new consultant radiologists. This is in line with the recommendations of the Hayes Report.  Interviews are expected to take place next month and the two successful candidates will take up duty as soon as possible in 2011.The Hayes Report recommended that consultant radiologist staffing levels should be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to the work load in each radiology department.  The HSE is committed to carrying out a review of consultant radiologist staffing levels in hospitals and to strengthening workforce planning across all radiology departments.  The review will be informed by the results of a survey of consultant radiologist staffing which is currently being undertaken by the Faculty of Radiology.  The aim is to complete this study by the end of the year.The HSE is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Hayes report as soon as possible.  I am confident that adopting this approach will help ensure the provision of a timely and quality radiology service in Tallaght Hospital.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	870	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 46 together.The new National Paediatric Hospital is a priority for the Government. The capital spending on it will be protected over the full lifetime of the project. The total estimated cost of the development, including the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght, is €650 million. This is €100m less than a previous estimate because of the fall in building prices.Of the total cost, €400m is committed by the Exchequer and is reflected in the HSE's capital plan this year.  This will be increased to a figure of €450 million in the HSE's capital plan for 2011. €25 million has already been spent on the planning, design and support of the project since 2007.  The balance will be met from philanthropic initiatives, estimated at €110 million, and from commercial and other sources of some €90 million.  The commercial and other sources include a car park, commercial units, research funding, private clinics, universities and medical schools.  One of the functions of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is to pursue philanthropic sources of funding. It is working intensively on this issue.The Development Board is making good progress in planning and developing the new hospital at the Mater site.  It has formally asked An Bórd Pleanála for the project to be considered under the Strategic Infrastructure legislation, and had an initial meeting with An Bórd Pleanála on 5 November 2010.  Subject to planning permission being granted, construction of the new hospital is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2011 with completion of construction scheduled for the end of 2014.

The Executive has published on its website details of the projects, including Kenmare, which it intends to deliver within this plan.The HSE is in receipt of the design/build tenders for the Kenmare Community Nursing Unit.  The tenders have been evaluated and the preferred bidder has been appointed.  A letter of intent to award the design/build contract for the facility has been issued to Glenbeigh Construction Ltd.  It is anticipated that the planning permission will be lodged before year end and that construction will commence early in 2011.  It is estimated that construction will take about 12 months.

The average waiting time for adults is currently 3 to 4 months and the average waiting time for children is approximately 6 weeks.Hearing aids that are provided through HSE services to medical card holders are purchased via a central contract. The contracted cost of a hearing aid can range from €71 to €399 and the total cost of hearing aids in 2009 was just over €1.4m for adults and €0.3m for children.  This does not include the cost of repairs, remakes, earmoulds or accessories which amounted to almost €0.2m.   There is no charge levied on patients for hearing aids.In June 2009, the HSE commissioned a National Review of Audiology Services. A key focus of this review is better integration of the various services provided by the HSE and external agencies involved in the provision of audiology services.   The Review has examined the services currently being provided to children and adults nationwide to inform a national plan for the service. The Review Group expects to complete its report by year end.

In view of this, the then Chief Medical Officer was asked to carry out a review of the information available in the Department on the issue.   The "Report on 3 Clinical Trials involving babies and children in institutional settings 1960/61, 1970 and 1973" (the Kiely Report) was laid before the Dáil on 9th November 2000 by the Minister for Health and Children, Mr. Mícheál Martin T.D.The Government decided that there should be further investigation of the matter and that the Commission to enquire into Child Abuse would be the most appropriate forum in which the investigation could be carried out.  In these circumstances, the Commission was given additional functions under the Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse Act 2000 (Additional Functions) Order, 2001 (S.I. No. 280 of 2001) to inquire into—(a) the 3 vaccine trials referred to in the Report of the Chief Medical Officer entitled "Report on Three Clinical Trials Involving Babies and Children in Institutional Settings 1960/1961, 1970 and 1973", and(b) any other vaccine trial found by the Commission to have taken place in an institution between 1940 and 1987 based on an allegation by a person who was a child in that institution that he or she was the subject of such a vaccine trial.The Vaccine Trials element of the Commission began its work by collecting information from a range of sources, including homes, pharmaceutical companies and the Department.  A considerable amount of data was gathered.The Commission commenced its investigation with the first trial which took place in 1960/61.  In 2003, in the course of a judgment on an issue about compelling a witness to attend, the Supreme Court commented on the issue of the vires of the SI but did not rule as it was not put to the Court. (The implication of the comment was to the effect that the SI was ultra vires)  The Chief Justice stated that "there is no indication in the report of the Chief Medical Officer which is recited as having led to the invocation by the Government of its powers under this provision, of any abuse of children within the meaning of the Act".  This opened up the possibility of further challenges being taken.  A subsequent Judicial review on the vires of the SI resulted in the High Court decision that the SI was ultra vires.Having carefully considered both the Court judgments and the High Court decision I decided that no further investigation would be carried out.  It is considered that it was very likely that any further investigation would experience similar difficulties to those encountered by the Commission.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	875	I understand from the HSE that admitted patients awaiting allocation of an inpatient bed in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda (Drogheda) and Cavan General Hospital are not discharged home while they await a transfer to a bed.  The discharge of a patient from hospital is a clinical decision which is made by a consultant or his or her medical team. The clinical condition and the age of patients is always taken into consideration by the hospital's bed management team in the allocation of available beds.The most recent weekly report for ED activity shows that for the week ending 5th November, at 2pm each day, no patient was waiting in excess of 24 hours for admission following the decision to admit them at Drogheda, while Cavan reported an average of less than one on the same basis.The HSE has identified a range of initiatives to maximise capacity and bed utilisation of the overall bed complement in both Drogheda and Cavan.  Improving access to inpatient beds will help to minimise the length of time patients remain in the Emergency Department (ED).In Drogheda measures are being taken to enhance the discharge and bed allocation processes and access to the recently established Medical Assessment Unit (MAU).  The provision of additional bed capacity through ongoing capital projects such as the development of the permanent MAU facility and the provision of additional CCU and ICU beds as well as an increase in the provision of PCCC supports for ED attendances is planned.The ED in Cavan has been refurbished resulting in expanded capacity.   The Hospital is implementing measures to improve bed utilisation and designation, the management of patients through the ED, access to the MAU and the transfer of patients to Primary and Community Care Services.

The development of the new CMH remains a priority for the Government and the HSE has been asked to submit a business case for the project and to explore alternative funding options to deliver the new hospital.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	877	The Report of the Review of Radiology Reporting and the Management of GP referral letters at Tallaght Hospital was commissioned by the HSE.  It was undertaken by Dr Maurice Hayes and launched and published by the HSE on 4th November 2010.  A copy of the Report is available on the HSE website.When the accumulation of the backlog of X-rays in Tallaght hospital became apparent the HSE took steps to ensure that there were no such problems in other hospitals.  As part of this process the HSE engaged with the Faculty of Radiology to produce advice and guidance for the system based on risk assessment.  The HSE also undertook a national audit of X-rays to identify if and where problems might exist in the wider health system.  It is expected that the HSE will report on its findings in a matter of weeks.The Faculty of Radiology also undertook, on its own initiative, to carry out a national workload and consultant manpower study in radiology departments.  It is hoped that this study will be complete by the end of the year.  The results of the study will be available to the HSE on completion.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	878	At the end of October 2010, there were 430.70 whole time equivalents (WTE) employed in my Department. In addition, a further 46.65 WTEs were employed across a number of offices including the Adoption Board, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, the Disability Appeals Office and the Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office. This level of employment represents an overall decrease of 27% since 2003 and this has been achieved as a result of  a number of developments including:the establishment of the HSE & HIQA and the transfer of certain functions from the Department to these bodies;the transfer of the General Register Office from the Department to the Department of Social Protection;the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement;the Incentivised Career Break Scheme; andthe moratorium on the filling of vacancies in the public service.It should also be noted that my Department took on a number of additional responsibilities and functions during this period. Responsibility for Childcare schemes and youth affairs transferred into my Department and three agencies have been subsumed under the Government's rationalisation of agencies programme.In line with the Employment Control Framework (ECF) setting out Government policy on numbers employed in the public service, my Department must further reduce its overall staffing complement to 450 by 2012. We will use all appropriate mechanisms such as re-organisation and re-allocation of work, including redeployment where necessary, to meet this target.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	879	Charges are levied for private patients availing of private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals. In most, but not all, cases these charges are paid by private health insurance companies on behalf of their members. At the end of 2009 some €92.5 million in such charges was due to the HSE, and a further €82.6 million owed to the voluntary hospitals. Charges due include those billed to patients or their insurance companies where payment was not received by year end and bills which had not issued by year end. In total, €386 million income was collected by HSE and voluntary hospitals during the course of 2009. The average debtor period in HSE hospitals for such charges is 5.7 months, and the corresponding period in voluntary hospitals is 5.2 months. (This refers to the time from discharge to receipt of payment).I consider that this collection period is unsatisfactory and in 2010 I set the HSE an enhanced income collection target for the year of €75 million. This target was to be achieved through improvements in the collection process and reduction in debtor days.  The target for improved collection set for this year and the associated initiatives underway to achieve this include the voluntary hospitals.  The industrial relations action by the health services staff in the early part of the year hindered action to achieve this target but a dedicated national project to accelerate income collection across all hospitals is now underway again.  The HSE has set hospital level targets for income collection and appropriate budgetary sanctions are applied should the targets not be achieved. The HSE has put in place arrangements to speed up the payment of claims, including the electronic submission of claims and the submission of claims on a more frequent basis. The HSE and private health insurers have also agreed arrangements in a number of hospitals for sign off of claims by another consultant where delays are experienced in getting sign off of claims by the treating consultant.   In addition, in order to comprehensively address issues of charging and collection in relation to this area the Department of Health and Children has undertaken a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Economic Cost and Charges Associated with Private and Semi-Private Treatment Services in Public Hospitals.  The issue of private patient income collection is addressed as part of this Review.  The Review will outline an example of best practice in relation to income collection and make a number of recommendations aimed at improving collection rates and debtors days. The review is currently being finalised and it is anticipated that the Review will be brought to Government shortly.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	880	Dementia is a most distressing condition both for those suffering from it and their families, and presents a significant and growing challenge to health and social services.  Alzheimer's disease represents about 70% of the cases of dementia.  People are living longer and as a consequence are more likely to develop some form of dementia. While dementia is not solely related to age, the prevalence is higher in older people and increases with age. It is estimated that about 5% of people over 65 years of age have some form of dementia with this figure rising to 20% for people over 80 years of age.  The demographic make–up of Irish society is changing.  The population is growing older and the number of people aged over 65 is estimated to almost triple over the next 30 years.As I have indicated previously, my Department has started the process of developing a policy on dementia that will support the delivery of long-term care services having regard to future demographic trends and the consequential increase in demand for long-term care.    This policy will be developed on the basis of the best evidence available from national and international sources. Officials in my Department have engaged with relevant stakeholder groups on the first stage of the process which is to assemble the research and evidence upon which the policy will be developed. I expect this will be received in 2011, at which stage work on the policy will commence formally.The Health Services Executive (HSE) is currently exploring the potential for changes in care pathways for people with dementia, and will make recommendations for the future provision of dementia care across all health and social services. An audit is underway within the HSE of the current specialist dementia care services available both in residential/hospital and community services and it is hoped to have it completed by the end of this year. This audit will inform future planning and development of services for people with dementia.  The educational needs of staff will also be identified to inform any future staff requirements for working in the area of dementia care. This work will also feed into the overall Dementia Policy formulation.

This will promote price competition and deliver ongoing savings for both the State and for patients.In June, I launched a report which sets out a proposed model for the operation of generic substitution and reference pricing. I expect to see significant progress on the implementation of this initiative, including the legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect in 2011.There are some medicines that are unsuitable for substitution. Decisions about the interchangeability of medicines will be evidence-based and take into account best practice elsewhere.Reference pricing will deliver direct savings by limiting reimbursement to a common reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines. Indirect savings will also occur as a result of increased price competition. The level of savings will depend upon a range of factors. These include the number and type of products included in reference groups, the relative and absolute prices of products within reference groups and the market response for each reference group.  I anticipate that reference pricing will initially be targeted at high volume products that have the potential to achieve significant savings. I would also highlight the strategic importance of this initiative as a significant number of drugs are due to come off patent in the coming years.This is one of a range of measures to increase value for money in this area of expenditure. I am pleased to note that the prices of over 500 generic medicines were reduced with effect from 1 October. Achieving greater value for money in this area of expenditure will ensure that patients can continue to access innovative and affordable medicines.

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in co-operatives, GPs contracted under the General Medical Services Scheme must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them (or a locum/deputy) for emergencies outside normal practice hours.  Co-operatives provide an ideal facility to enable GPs to discharge this obligation.There were over 983,000 contacts with GP out-of-hours co-operatives in 2009 and the total cost of funding out-of-hours services was €110 million.A National Review of GP Out-of-Hours Services was published by the HSE in March 2010. It is the first national review to be undertaken since the commencement of publicly funded GP co-operatives in 1999.  It reviewed the 9 GP co-operatives and the 4 extended-hours services that are currently in place.The Review makes a series of recommendations designed to strengthen and standardise out-of-hours services across the country.  Among these recommendations are that:out-of-hours services be extended to cover parts of the country where there is currently no such provision. Each of the 4 HSE regions will now engage with non-participating GPs with the aim of ensuring full out-of-hours coverage nationally.the number of call centres be reduced from 7 to 4.A working group comprising representatives from the HSE, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Association of General Practitioner Co-operatives has been established to advance the implementation of the recommendations.

The Clinical Leads for the Programme are Dr. Joe Harbison, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and Prof. Peter Kelly, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin.In July 2010 the HSE completed the Hospital Emergency Stroke Services (HESS) Survey for all 33 acute hospitals admitting patients with a suspected stroke.  The number of Stroke Units reported was as follows:Hospitals reporting Acute Stroke Units — 6;Hospitals reporting a Combined (Acute and Rehabilitation) Stroke Unit — 9;Hospitals reporting a Rehabilitation Stroke Unit — 3.Since then, clinicians have informed the Stroke Programme that one further acute stroke unit has been opened.Modern definitions of a stroke unit vary, however the HSE's Stroke Programme has adopted key elements common to many of these definitions, including beds in a geographically defined area of the hospital, a designated lead consultant and multidisciplinary team providing coordinated care to patients. Work is now under way to define standards for acute stroke care consistent with international definitions to support continuous improvement in acute stroke care.In the Hospital Emergency Stroke Services (HESS) Survey hospitals reported provision of thrombolysis for acute stroke cases as follows:24/7 service: reported by 16 hospitals;Weekday service: reported by 6 hospitals;Some thrombolysis carried out: reported by 3 hospitals.The Stroke Programme is working with HSE Regional and Network management to identify the appropriate level of thrombolysis services to be provided by hospitals within acute stroke networks. Emergency care pathways will then be implemented for patients with suspected acute stroke. A training programme is under way to support clinicians to provide a safe stroke thrombolysis service for patients, with support as required from colleagues at network, regional and national levels.

Evidence shows that lower socio economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco. It was considered that this group is in greatest need of assistance in helping them to quit the habit.  Accordingly, it was decided, as an exceptional measure, to make NRT available on prescription to medical card holders.Smoking Cessation Services within the Health Service Executive offer a wide variety of services in different areas.  Specialist Smoking Cessation Counsellors are trained to deliver these services on full time, part time and sessional basis nationally.  Health Promotion Departments within the HSE also offer an extensive programme of training that includes developing skills for health care practitioners to support people wishing to stop smoking. They also provide support to schools around the issue of smoking and substance misuse, and support to workplaces on developing smoking policies.The HSE funds the National Smokers Quitline which, in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, provides a smoking cessation advice and support service. This provides the public with access to a telephone support service from a trained smoking cessation counsellor. Referral to local smoking cessation services can also be arranged. A quitting booklet is offered and sent out to all callers who request it.There have been a number of social marketing campaigns on smoking developed in Ireland over the past number of years. In 2009 a radio, billboard and television campaign was launched which targeted parents and guardians encouraging them to think about how their smoking effects and influences their children. This campaign has continued in 2010.

In the event that there are such individuals identified, they will be dealt with in the context of the fair procedures of the disciplinary process for the Health Service. As there are expert matters in this report the RDO will take the appropriate expert advice in forming any such decision.For the future, the Health and Social Care Council is in place and is setting up a Social Work Registration Board, set to commence in early 2011 for the registration of social workers.  This will provide a more formal disciplinary process for Social Workers and will include the potential to hold Fitness to Practice investigations where appropriate.

The increasing complexity of cases, allied with the expanding spectrum of therapies for diverse diseases, has highlighted the need to strengthen the level of paediatric immunology services available in Ireland.In order to do this, I am pleased to say that the HSE has provided funding to support two consultant immunology posts structured as follows:(a) Consultant paediatric immunologist with a special interest in paediatric allergy. The post will be deployed with 24 hours in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, 10 hours in Tallaght Hospital and 3 hours in St. James's Hospital, and(b) Consultant paediatrician with a special interest in primary immune deficiency. The post will be deployed with 24 hours in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, 10 hours in the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street and 3 hours in St. James's Hospital.The two new consultant posts will ensure the investigation, clinical assessment, treatment and holistic management of patients with:Primary immune deficiency (Children born with defective immune systems);Secondary immune deficiency (patients whose immune systems become impaired because of other conditions or treatments);Allergies and Anaphylaxis;Auto-inflammatory disorders such as disorganised immunity or periodic fever syndromes.The establishment of the two consultant posts, based in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, will support the integrated management of such disorders and thus improved outcomes.

These include Asthma, COPD, Heart Failure, Stroke and Diabetes.  The approach to these chronic diseases will be to improve quality and access in a cost effective manner.  Improving access will involve mandating Primary Care direct access to diagnostics rather than patients having to attend hospital out patient facilities.  The diagnostics that are being targeted initially are spirometry (breath tests for diagnosis and management of COPD and Asthma), Ultrasound and Radiology.  It is envisaged that most routine treatment of these chronic diseases will take place in Primary Care and the provision of diagnostics is seen as an essential part of this shift in care.

The matters highlighted in the original investigation by the Western Health Board (the McCoy Report) and in the Hynes Report completed for my Department, were addressed in statements made by officials of my Department and the HSE to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on 29th June 2010, in the context of the Committee's consideration of the report of the Irish Human Rights Commission into the operation of one of the facilities concerned.  In view of the recommendations of the IHRC Report, consider that our priority going forward should be to focus our efforts on ensuring that models of service and care for people with intellectual disabilities are operated with appropriate safeguards and that unsuitable, congregated residential facilities are phased out as quickly as possible in favour of more appropriate community based settings. These issues are being taken into consideration in the preparation of a policy review which is currently underway in my Department in the context of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	890	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 78 together.The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (the "Croke Park Agreement") provides a framework for public service management and staff to work together to deliver an ongoing reduction in the cost of delivery of public services, while maintaining and improving the quality of services delivered to the public, in return for commitments on pay and security of employment for public servants.  The Implementation Body has been established to drive the implementation of the Agreement across all sectors and ensure that early, robust and verifiable reforms are secured, which lead to sustainable and verifiable savings in the cost of public service delivery.Chapter 2 of the Public Service Agreement sets out the Health Sectoral Agreement and contained within this chapter are eleven measures which are to be implemented with "immediate effect".  These cover a wide range of areas, including the centralisation of functional, transactional, support and other services, including through the use of shared services within the public health services, as referred to by Deputy Gilmore.The Health Sector Action Plan, which was developed by my Department working closely with the HSE, sets out a detailed list of actions which will be required for the implementation of the eleven immediate measures, mentioned above.Shared services is an area where good progress has been made, with the centralisation of the medical cards and the processing of Fair Deal scheme applications already underway.  Similarly, significant work has already been done in developing the National Recruitment Services, National Personnel Administration and National Pensions Management units in the HSE.  A Financial Shared Services structure is now also in place and work is entering the next phase where all finance transaction processing staff across the whole Executive will report into this new structure.   I am advised that, in respect of the HSE's proposed National Finance and Procurement Solution, the HSE has been developing a plan for a viable and sustainable project for the roll out of such a system.  Recently, my Department met with the Department of Finance (CMOD) and the HSE to see how a plan could be activated, taking account of the current resource constraints facing the HSE.  It was agreed that the first step is to identify a technology platform upon which the proposed finance and procurement system can be developed, and it is expected that a PIN notice (Prior Indicative Notice) will issue shortly to the market for this purpose.  In addition, I also understand that a new operating model is to be put in place in the procurement area of the HSE.  The aim behind this new model is to eliminate duplication and to provide greater flexibility in staff roles and to redeploy staff, where necessary.The Health Sector Implementation Body (HSIB) is responsible for driving the implementation of the Action Plan and will be required to report on progress to the Implementation Body.   Local structures are also being put in place at regional level across the HSE to help to drive implementation of the Public Service Agreement at a regional level and report progress to the HSIB.

Patients are placed on the national list only after they have been waiting three months, because many people receive their treatment within three months and, in some cases, with little or no waiting.  It is not appropriate to classify these patients as "awaiting treatment" in the same way as those who have been waiting for several months. The NTPF's figures for August 2010 indicate that the number of patients waiting for over three months was 20,178.  It is not correct, therefore, to conclude that there are over 46,000 patients on waiting lists.In relation to the Deputies' queries on individual hospital waiting lists and the August comparison to September data, which is due for publication shortly, I have referred the questions to the Executive for direct reply.

Provision for the establishment of such a system will be included in the proposed Health Information Bill which is currently being drafted. The Bill will also set down an overall governance framework for this area covering matters such as issue and use of as well as access to these unique health identifiers.  While the Bill will provide the legislative framework for this system, its actual introduction will be determined in the context of developments across the wider public sector as well as consideration of economic and financial implications.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published early to mid-2011.

The Regulations providing for the establishment of the Regional Health Forums — the Health Act 2004 (Regional Health Forums) Regulations 2005 — were made on 12 December 2005 and provided for the establishment of the Forums on 1 January 2006.The function of the Regional Health Forums, as set out in the 2004 Act, is to provide local public representatives with an opportunity to make representations to the Health Service Executive on the range and operation of health and personal social services in their area.  The establishment of the Forums demonstrated the Government's commitment to ensuring that local public representatives would continue to be heard in relation to the operation and development of health and personal social services in their areas.  The Forums complement the role of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in the ongoing oversight of the health services.There are no plans at present for any change either to the structure or role of the Forums.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	896	The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years. This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the Employment Control Framework for the health sector.  The Framework for 2010-2012 gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector and provides that there will be a net reduction in employment to 2012. This includes a target reduction in numbers in 2010 to achieve the overall reduction of 6,000 from March 2009 to the end 2012 and consequential pay roll savings. Based on numbers reductions already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction to end 2012 is 4,560 WTE (or 1,520 per annum). While there is provision in the HSE's Employment Control Framework for some exemptions and exceptions these are limited because of the need to achieve the required payroll savings.Under the ECF 2010-2012 grades exempted from the moratorium/special provisions include:Clinical Psychologist, Behavioural Therapist, Counsellor — replacement posts and up to 230 in addition to the Dec 09 outturn;up to 100 Psychiatric Nurses vacancies where they are required to support the implementation of "A Vision for Change";up to 70 Public Health Nurse posts to facilitate the appointment of student public health nurses; andup to 30 posts to facilitate the appointment of successful students from the Nurse Sponsorship Scheme.The HSE's Health Service Personnel Census indicates that the change in the numbers employed, in the public health service of 1,272 wholetime equivalents, between end 2008 and end 2009 by grade category is as follows:Grade category31/12/200831/12/2009Change between Dec 08 and Dec 09% Change between Dec 08 and Dec 09Medical/Dental8,1098,083-26-0.32%Nursing38,10837,466-642-1.68%Health & Social Care Professionals15,98015,973-7-0.04%Management/Admin17,96717,611-357-1.98%General Support Staff*12,63111,906-724-5.74%Other Patient & Client Care*18,23018,7144842.65%Total111,025109,753-1,272-1.15%Notes: (1) Excludes Home Helps. (2) Student nurses are included in the 2008 employment ceiling on the basis of 3.5 students equating to 1 wholetime equivalent. The employment level adjusted for student nurses on the above basis is 111,001 WTEs. (3) Student nurses are included in the 2009 figures on the basis of 2 students equating to 1 wholetime equivalent — the figures above are already adjusted.*The data for Other Patient and Client Care and General Support Staff may have been affected by reclassification between grade categories.The census also indicates that between year end 2008 and year end 2009, the number of mental health nurses decreased by 4% but the number of clinical psychologists increased by 3.5%.Under the Employment Control Framework, agency staff can only be used in exceptional circumstances to provide emergency relief for medical/professional staff providing essential frontline health, welfare and protection services. They may not be used to: (i) substitute for management/administrative staff; (ii) substitute or replace temporary positions which have been terminated or posts which have been suppressed under the framework; or (iii) effectively increase the numbers of staff employed.As I have already outlined, the target reductions in the Employment Control Framework are necessary to restructure the public service and to reduce public service numbers, and to support the Government's strategy to restore the public finances.In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, on the 1st November 2010, I announced that the Government had decided to approve a voluntary early retirement scheme and a voluntary redundancy scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service. The schemes are open to both management/administrative grades and support staff but priority will be given to the management/administrative grades.  The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.

The capital spending on it will be protected over the full lifetime of the project. The total estimated cost of the development, including the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght, is €650 million. This is €100m less than a previous estimate because of the fall in building prices.Of the total cost, €400m is committed by the Exchequer and is reflected in the HSE's capital plan this year.  This will be increased to a figure of €450 million in the HSE's capital plan for 2011. €25 million has already been spent on the planning, design and support of the project since 2007.  The balance will be met from philanthropic initiatives, estimated at €110 million, and from commercial and other sources of some €90 million.  The commercial and other sources include car park, commercial units, research funding, private clinics, universities and medical schools.  One of the functions of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is to pursue philanthropic sources of funding. It is working intensively on this issue.The  Development Board is making good progress in planning and developing the new hospital at the Mater site.  It has formally asked An Bórd Pleanála for the project to be considered under the Strategic Infrastructure legislation, and had an initial meeting with An Bórd Pleanála on 5 November 2010.  Subject to planning permission being granted, construction of the new hospital is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2011 with completion of construction scheduled for the end of 2014.

In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.The moratorium on public sector recruitment is not a factor in the Non Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) vacancies being experienced in the public health service at present. In addition, the moratorium includes a specific exemption allowing for the replacement of NCHDs by consultants.  Other countries are also experiencing difficulties in recruiting NCHDs.My Department and the HSE agreed revised visa and work permit arrangements with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and Justice, Equality and Law Reform last June which were put into effect in advance of the July 2010 rotation.In relation to service needs in January 2011, my Department is working with HSE to ensure that an adequate number of NCHDs is maintained in the public health service.The HSE are currently developing a range of strategies and initiatives for the forthcoming NCHD rotations in 2011 with a view to maximising recruitment and retention.  Measures in train include: development of a two year contract of employment for posts that are difficult to fill; restructuring training rotations to ensure they're appropriately aligned with service requirements; development of a centralised recruitment process for service posts; introducing a single contact point for HSE agencies to obtain locum/temporary medical staff; measures to progress the appointment of additional Consultants and where reconfiguration is appropriate that it takes place on a planned structured basis.

It identified three priority areas for implementation on a national basis.  A national diabetes footcare programme is one of these high priority areas. This is consistent with my Department's published policy on diabetes.  A Clinician Programme Director for Diabetes has been appointed and he is currently engaging with all stakeholders, including the Diabetic Federation of Ireland, clinicians and podiatrists to establish a multidisciplinary footcare package for diabetic patients.  The programme is intended to establish referral pathways with rapid access to specialised care within a multidisciplinary foot care service.  The initiative is currently in an advanced planning stage.  A full costing of  the national footcare programme is not available at this time but funding will be provided within the existing resources available to the HSE.

The charges are subject to a cap of  €10 per month for each person or family. In 2008 only 2.1% of families with medical cards had 20 or more items prescribed to them per month.Should a person or family pay more than €10, for example if different pharmacies are used in the same month, the HSE will issue refunds automatically on a quarterly basis based on the information received from the dispensing pharmacy.  However, if a person considers that they have not received the refund due to them there is a refund claim form available through the HSE and an online version of the form is available on www.medicalcard.ie.In some cases family members may not have the same medical card number, e.g. where more than one doctor is used by the family. It is important for all of the family members to be grouped together so that any prescription charge paid by them goes towards reaching the maximum total monthly charge payable. Patients can check online that all members of their family are grouped together or contact the HSE directly at 1800-252-919. If necessary, patients can set their family up as a family group on www.medicalcard.ie and print off a certificate (family certificate) to give to their pharmacists.  Patients can also contact their Local Health Office or call 1890-252-919 to provide their family details and a certificate will be posted out.It is in the interests of both the HSE and patients that the instances of medical card holders being charged more than €10 per month for prescription charges are kept to an absolute minimum. As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

Patients are triaged and assessed weekly and all admissions are based on clinical need in consultation with the treating clinicians. Early last week, the increased demand for beds was such that eleven patients' admissions to these in-patient beds were deferred. These patients have now been facilitated.  The majority of chemotherapy is delivered on a day-case basis and day-case chemotherapy patients were not affected.Medical oncology (chemotherapy) is also available at Letterkenny General, Sligo General, Mayo General and Portiuncula Hospitals to enable patients to have treatment delivered locally. The appointment of an additional consultant medical oncologist at Letterkeny General is being progressed by the National Cancer Control Programme, as is a joint appointment between Galway and Sligo which will further enhance medical oncology at Sligo.The National Cancer Control Programme was established in 2007 to oversee the implementation of the 2006 National Cancer Control Strategy. Since then, considerable progress has been made in the reorganisation of cancer services in line with the Strategy.

The recruitment of these additional social workers was provided for in the HSE Service Plan 2010. The filling of social work vacancies and the recruitment of additional social workers was exempted from the current public sector recruitment moratorium.The latest available information from the HSE's Employment Census for September, shows an increase of 93 social work posts in 2010, an increase of 43 over the figure for August. The HSE has advised that there is a time lag between individuals taking up duty and their inclusion in the HSE Employment Census. In this regard the HSE has further advised that contracts have issued in respect of all 200 approved posts. My Department has been assured by the HSE that all 200 additional social workers will be in place by year end.

I am pleased to outline the services that exist in each of these three hospitals.A minor injuries unit and additional ambulance services have been put in place in Dundalk to support this plan. Gynaecology, medical and surgical day services, stroke rehabilitation, radiology and step down services remain in the hospital. In addition, an elderly day assessment service has transferred to Dundalk. Project teams have also been established to progress with development of plans for both the orthopaedic rehabilitation and medical palliative inpatient beds in the hospital.Acting on the advice of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland the HSE ceased all acute and emergency surgery at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan on 1 September 2010. The transfer of this surgery was always a long-term objective of the North East Transformation Plan. Minor elective surgery (i.e. requiring local anaesthetic only) and endoscopy services are situated in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  It is still also the regional centre for elective orthopaedic surgery.Services at Monaghan Hospital include surgical and medical day services, rehabilitation and step-down services, a Minor Injury Unit and X-ray Diagnostics. Orthopaedics, Diagnostic urology, Obstetric and Gynaecological outpatient clinics also take place in the hospital.A Cross Border Ear, Nose and Throat Service, which is based in Monaghan hospital and consists of out patient clinics and day procedures, was enhanced in April 2010 to include a second consultant who is performing sinus day surgery. Furthermore a CT scanner is now operational in the hospital. It will also facilitate patients being referred from out patient clinics from Cavan and Monaghan Hospital sites and will enable local access for patients from Co. Monaghan.The development of the above services demonstrates the Government's commitment to the future of Monaghan, Dundalk and Navan Hospitals. Patient safety is central to the delivery of health services. People must have confidence in the care they receive and have the best possible outcomes.  All decisions regarding the operation of health services will be taken with patient safety as the priority.

The Special Projects for Youth Scheme (SPY) is one such initiative supported, and funding of €19.5million has been allocated to this Scheme in 2010 through resources made available under Subhead G of Vote 41, which is part funded by the National Lottery.There are currently one hundred and eighty one (181) projects in receipt of funding under this scheme.  Some €17.8 million has been spent to date and the CYSDU is currently in the process of making final payments to the remaining Organisations/VECs/Projects. The balance of €1.7 million will be expended in 2010. Special Projects for Youth  — under this Scheme, grant-in-aid is made available to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a combination of factors e.g., social isolation, substance misuse, homelessness, early school leaving and unemployment. Projects facilitate the personal and social development of participants thus enabling them to realise their potential. This aim underpins all programmes and activities of the Scheme. In addition, they present opportunities for young people to undertake actions corresponding to their own aspirations and to assume responsibilities within their local communities.Services are delivered by a combination of local youth organisations and local community groups. In general, these youth work initiatives entail consultation with the local community, the involvement of members of the local community in the management structure of the project, and liaison with other voluntary and statutory agencies operating in the youth service sphere.

Of these, over 12,250 have been approved and applications continue to be processed on a daily basis. Approximately 200 applications have been refused on the basis that the applicant was deemed not to require long-term residential care or that the applicant's contribution to care exceeded the cost of care.The average length of time to process an application varies depending on whether the application is for State support only, or for State support and the Nursing Home Loan. It also depends on the complexity of the case. The HSE has indicated that a significant volume of applications are submitted without the necessary supporting documentation. This can create delays which are outside of the HSE's control. However, once fully complete and in order, applications are processed within approximately 1-2 weeks. Following approval of an application, the HSE immediately arranges for payment of financial support on the applicant's behalf to their chosen nursing home.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	912	The operation of the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE (PAD) allows for the centralised receipt, assignment and tracking of Parliamentary Questions within the HSE's extensive network of operations. More generally, PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the Executive. It reports on a regular basis to the Chief Executive Officer and his management team.In 2007 the Executive worked to a timeframe of responding to referred questions within 20 working days and this target was met for 65% of referred questions. From January 2008, this timeframe was reduced to 15 working days and 73% of referred questions were answered within this period. In 2009, 62% of questions referred to the Executive were answered within the 15 day timeframe.  However, between January and July of this year, the number of questions answered within the 15 day timeframe dropped to 43%. This was due to a period of industrial action which commenced on a limited basis within the Health Service Executive on the 4th January 2010 and which escalated in effect from 1st March through to June 15th.  However, from September to October this year the percentage answered on time increased to 54% and this upward trend is expected to continue.The Executive is very conscious of the need for prompt responses to Parliamentary Questions and there is regular liaison between my Department and the Executive in this regard. While the Executive attempts to answer all questions referred to it as quickly as possible, many of the questions submitted by Deputies request large and detailed amounts of statistical data on a variety of subjects which require input and co-ordination from all areas of the Executive. Recent questions of this nature submitted to my Department include:the number of home help hours provided in each year from 2007 to 2010 on a county basis;the number of TB cases diagnosed in every county for each year between 2005 and 2010;the number of persons on the waiting list for hearing aids in each HSE region;the number of persons currently on waiting lists to see consultants in every hospital and the length of time each person has been on the list.Given the volume of information sought in these type of questions, the Deputy will appreciate that it may not be possible to provide responses to such questions within the 15 day timeframe. However, my officials are working closely with the HSE to try to improve the service to members of the Oireachtas generally, and at recent meetings with the new CEO of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, I have stressed the importance of providing responses to Parliamentary Questions that are both prompt and of a high quality. Mr. Magee is very aware of my concerns in this regard and is committed to improving the handling of parliamentary affairs within the HSE.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	914	The KPMG report on maternity services in the Greater Dublin Area recommended that maternity and related services should transfer from the three existing maternity hospitals in Dublin to locations on adult acute hospital sites. It  recommended that services at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) at Holles Street should move to the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus at Elm Park. It also recommended that the Coombe should transfer to Tallaght Hospital and that the Rotunda services should be established on the Mater Hospital site. This report has been adopted by the HSE, and steps are being taken towards implementation of the  recommendations made.The NMH and St. Vincent's have commenced work to develop the proposal further. An initial business case has been prepared, and consideration has been given to options for the location of a new maternity hospital facility on the St. Vincent's campus.  Further work is now in progress, including the preparation of a full business case and the identification of potential sources of capital funding.  The Government is in favour of transferring the Dublin maternity hospitals to adult hospital sites as recommended by KPMG.  The means by which this could be achieved is being pursued by the HSE.

This is managed centrally within the HSE and funding is allocated to qualifying individuals on a "first come, first served" basis.An additional €97 million was provided for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme in Budget 2010. The additional funding brings the total budget for long-term residential care in 2010 to €979 million.  This is effectively the budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme albeit that transitional arrangements must also be facilitated from within the subhead, i.e. people in contract beds or people who choose to remain on subvention. The HSE is currently on target to meet all demand for financial support towards nursing home care from within this budget in 2010.  The overall budget for the scheme in 2011 will be determined by Government following discussions between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance as part of the estimates process. Deliberations by Government on the expenditure allocations for 2011 are likely to continue up until Budget time.

The Service is a critical support to older people in particular, facilitating prompt discharge from Acute Hospitals or preventing inappropriate admissions to such hospitals or long stay residential care. Significant progress has been made in developing this service since 2006, as set out in the following table, with a noticeable impact in terms of numbers of people benefiting, as well as providing support to the acute hospital sector.  The HSE is committed to achieving the targets for 2010 set out in its Service Plan.Activity20062007200820092010Hours provided10.8m11.78m11.96m11.97m11.98m (Target)No. of clients benefiting at 31st Dec each year49,57854,73655,36653,79154,500 (Target)Funding €185.4m206.4m211m211m211mThe capacity of the HSE to provide approved levels of Home Help services continues to be reviewed in the context of overall resources available to the Executive.  It is incumbent on each Local Health Manager to ensure that Home Help services are delivered within allocated budgets.  This requires a stringent on-going review of the application of the resources.Service ImprovementThe Home Help Service has emerged over the years from what was essentially a "friendly neighbour" service within the old health board structure and, as it is a discretionary service, different approaches emerged in different areas.  The service is becoming more professional and demanding as increased numbers of clients with significant and complex needs are maintained at home.   In 2010-2011, work is underway to roll out improvements to ensure that applicants are treated in a similar way regardless of where they live in the country.Given the large numbers benefitting, it is critical that the National Guidelines for the Home Help Service, now being finalised by the HSE are available to assist staff in managing the service in an equitable way.  The Guidelines which will be implemented nationally over 2011 will incorporate flexibility to allow professional staff allocating the service to take full account of the particular care needs, abilities and dependencies of the individual client.  In this way, a client in Mayo or in Wexford can expect to be able to apply, and be assessed, for the service in a similar way and, subject to resource limits, have appropriate services allocated to support their individual requirements.Home Care PackagesHome Care Packages (HCPs), are enhanced supports over and above existing mainstream community services, with the objective of maintaining older people at home and in their communities.  They are also targeted towards those at risk of inappropriate admission to long-term care or acute hospitals, or those who require discharge home from acute hospital.  In order to maintain people at home for as long as possible and to support discharges home from acute hospitals there has been considerable investment over the past few years in Home Care Packages, as set out below.The following table sets out the considerable investment in HCPs since 2006. The HSE is committed to achieving the targets for the HCP Scheme as set out in its Service Plan 2010.Activity20062007200820092010No. of clients in receipt of a HCP at year end (ongoing capacity measure)5,2838,0358,9908,9599,613 (Target)No. of clients benefiting from a HCP (throughput) in a calendar year7,00311,56511,98712,00313,200 (Target)Funding €55m110m120m120m130mDeliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage, pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.  Notwithstanding this difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect the services referred to by the Deputy, to respond to priority demographic and other needs, and to support ongoing reform of the public heath services within the resources available for health.

During the discussion I raised with them the VHI's decision not to cover customers in co-located hospitals, and asked them to review their position on the matter having regard to the benefits that co-location will bring to patients.  I emphasised that I have no role in the commercial decisions of private health insurers, and that all insurers are free to choose the service providers who they believe will best meet the needs of their customers.  The VHI agreed to consider the matter further and to revert to me.  The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process and the HSE will continue to work with the preferred bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.

A student must also take at least 5 of their subjects in the leaving Certificate through Irish and this must be confirmed in his/her application for the scholarship.Unfortunately, due to a computer error in the selection process for these Scholarships this year, the student to which the Deputy refers was offered a Scholarship in error.  On becoming aware of the situation, the scholarship awards were re-checked and it transpired that the student had, in fact, only taken three subjects through Irish.  This means that his application under the Scheme was invalid.  My Department had no option but to withdraw the Scholarship offer on this basis.  It was explained to the student, and I am sure that the Deputy will understand this, that in the interest of fairness to the student to whom the scholarship should otherwise have been awarded, the Department must abide strictly by the rules as outlined in the scholarship scheme.  The award was subsequently made to that student.

A two stage selection process was used for the selection of schools:Stage 1: Examined all schools against sub criteria that were independent of the schools.Stage 2:  Examined schools qualified from stage 1 against sub criteria that were school dependent.STAGE 14 sub criteria were identified under Stage 1 of the selection process as set out below:Geographical Location;Technical Mix;Social Inclusion andAdequate mix of schoolsGeographical Location:The working group sought to ensure that an appropriate percentage of schools invited to participate in the project was achieved between both Dublin and provincial locations.  It was also felt that an urban/rural mix could be achieved by ensuring that an adequate number of places were available to the provincial locations.  Additionally, it was felt that all counties should be represented in the pilot project.  Whilst geographical location was used as the starting point in deciding the selection of schools for progress to stage 2, the working group examined each location with the other criteria in mind.  Accordingly, in order to achieve excellent VFM with regard to both backhaul and infrastructure investment, the working group decided to locate a significant number of the provincial locations in places where HEAnet has a major point of presence (PoP) and a contractual agreement to access the PoP.The working group decided that the following regions should be included for participation in the pilot project:Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Athlone, Galway, Letterkenny, Waterford, Dundalk, Tipperary.The remaining places were reserved for locations outside these areas that satisfied specific requirements of the pilot project.Technology Mix:The working group wanted to ensure that all technologies that can deliver a 100Mbit/s connection would be tested during the demonstration project.  It was decided that areas within a 30km radius of HEAnet PoPs would satisfy this requirement.  Accordingly, all schools located within this radius for each of the eight PoPs were identified.In the Dublin area, it is anticipated that a variety of access technologies could connect the selected schools.  As such, the working group were of the opinion that the telecommunications market in Dublin was sufficiently developed to allow a mix of bandwidth technologies to be proposed without the need for further intervention by the working group.The working group decided that the schools in Dublin should, where possible, include five schools from each of the local authorities.Social Inclusion:The working group wanted to ensure that specific communities could be included in the project from a social inclusion perspective.  This criterion ensures that island, rural and DEIS schools were included in the project.Adequate Mix of Schools:While prioritising schools with a significant student population under the criteria set out above, the working group endeavoured to ensure that an adequate mix of schools was also chosen to be invited to participate in the demonstration project.  Consequently, a number of schools were selected with reference to the following selection criteria:Schools with large cohort of students with special educational needs;Post Leaving Certificate Schools;Gaelscoileanna/Gaeltacht Schools;ICT Adoption;Gender mix;Rural/urban mix;Schools type;Size of school.STAGE 2Stage 2 of the selection process sought to ensure that the schools shortlisted from Stage 1 had the commitment, infrastructure and support to realize the potential of 100Mbit/s bandwidth.  Shortlisted schools were invited to apply for inclusion in the project outlining how participation in the project supports their Whole School Evaluation/e-learning plan, and what is required of them in being involved in the project.  The working group felt a range of schools with differing levels of ICT usage and infrastructure would be desirable in the project.  However, the majority of schools qualifying will demonstrate an existing potential to use 100Mbit/s internet access for learning and teaching purposes.  Schools had to agree to the project commitments to qualify for the project.  3 sub criteria were identified under stage 2 of the selection process as set out below:Current structures and Infrastructure;Usage of internet for learning and teaching, including any projects; andCommitment to the project requirements over the next 2 years.Current Structures and Infrastructure:The working group wanted to ensure that all schools qualified from Stage 1 would be examined with regard to their ability to utilise the proposed connection as quickly as possible.  It was proposed to focus on the schools individual e-learning team and plan, current ICT infrastructure (specifically devices) and teachers ICT proficiency.Usage of internet for learning and teaching, including any projects:The working group wanted to ensure that the schools invited to participate in the project had a digital agenda with regard to ICT within the learning and teaching environment.  From a project feasibility point of view, all schools identified as suitable for participation in the pilot were subject to examination with regard to cost effectiveness and the ability to deliver the required infrastructure within budgetary constraints.

The student grant schemes include provision for grants to eligible students pursuing certain full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in other EU Member States.  In addition, Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full-time and part-time courses in both private and publicly-funded third level colleges and universities.  Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.

The NCSE has published its report on the Review of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) Allocation to Schools April 2009- March 2010 on its website www.ncse.ie. The NCSE has since carried out a number of further reviews of SNA allocation of schools, bringing the total number of schools reviewed as at September 2010 to 3,056. Of this number, 2,363 were primary schools, 588 post-primary schools and 105 were special schools.  To date, 9,829 SNA posts have been reviewed and 9,395 SNA posts remain in the schools concerned. 434 SNA posts have been withdrawn from schools — in these cases, either the students for whom the posts were originally allocated had left the school or the students' care needs had diminished over time.Of 2,363 primary schools reviewed 1,261 schools had no change in their SNA level, 704 had a decrease in SNA level, and 398 schools had an increase in their SNA level.  Of 588 primary schools reviewed 304 schools had no change in their SNA level, 158 had a decrease in SNA level, and 126 schools had an increase in their SNA level.  Of 105 special schools reviewed 54 schools had no change in their SNA level, 29 had a decrease in SNA level, and 22 schools had an increase in their SNA level.  The full updated report will be published by the NCSE shortly on its website www.ncse.ie.  A small number of schools remain to be reviewed and the NCSE has indicated that these will be reviewed shortly.There are currently in excess of 10,000 SNAs in schools compared with just 300 in 1997.  I wish to emphasise that the criteria governing the allocation of SNA posts has not changed, and that SNA posts continue to be retained, and new posts sanctioned, where the care needs of pupils meet the criteria for the scheme.  I can confirm for the Deputy that I am very supportive of the SNA scheme.  It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.However, the Deputy will appreciate that the preparation of the Budget is carried out on a strictly confidential basis and as a result it would not be appropriate for me to comment specifically on this matter in advance of the formal announcements involved.  The Government has made it clear that difficult decisions will be necessary across the broad spectrum of public expenditure in order to secure the significant level of savings required.  This will obviously impact on sectors of public expenditure, including the education sector.  The Government will, however, seek to ensure that the necessary savings are achieved in a fair and equitable way.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	936	I acknowledge that the cost of attending higher education is an important factor for a great number of students and their families.  However the Deputy will appreciate that some 43% of all undergraduate students received financial support under my Department's student grant schemes in the 2009/2010 academic year and this number is likely to rise further this year.  Under the student grant schemes, students are eligible for grants at either what is known as an adjacent or a non-adjacent rate.The adjacent rate of grant, which ranges from €330 to €2,545 depending on individual circumstances, is payable where a student's normal residence is 24 Kilometres or less from the college which he/she is attending.  The non-adjacent rate of grant, which ranges from €810 to €6,355 again, depending on individual circumstances, is payable in all other cases.  Students in need of extra help due to particular financial circumstances may apply to the Access Officer in their institution for support from the Student Assistance Fund.The Government is committed to ensuring that opportunities to engage in higher education continue to be made available to potential learners and that access to higher education will continue to be determined by a student's ability and not their financial circumstances.  A key challenge for the development of the sector will be in enabling it to meet future demand on a sustainable funding basis, without compromising on quality.  A widening of the funding base for the sector, to reduce the relatively high level of dependence on the Exchequer, is one of the issues to be considered in that context.

My Department seeks to ensure that prompt payment is made to all suppliers while at the same time satisfying the requirement, under the Public Financial Procedures, that invoices are correctly certified as being in order for payment.  In the period mid-July 2010 to mid-October 2010 just under €500 was paid in Prompt Payment Interest Penalties to a total of 17 suppliers who were paid outside of the required 30 days payment period.

During that month claims were submitted for the payment of 74 retired teachers for work undertaken in a substitute capacity.  This represented about 1.75% of the teachers engaged in substitute work for whom the managerial authorities submitted claims for payment.There were fifty five retired primary teachers employed on a part-time contractual basis in the primary sector during September.  During that month claims were submitted for the payment of 302 retired teachers for work undertaken in a substitute capacity.  These claims represented approximately 8% of the teachers engaged in substitute work for whom the managerial authorities submitted claims for payment.  Generally the professional development support services under the remit of my Department notify school principals of events that may be relevant to different cohorts of teachers, e.g on a subject/programme basis, and it is up to the principal to identify which teachers should attend.  My Department does not maintain data on the employment classification of teachers who avail of such training.

The purpose of the grant-aid is to provide such students with equipment of direct educational benefit to them.  Examples of such equipment include computers, word processors, tape recorders, software, etc.The scheme is driven by applications from schools on behalf of individual students, as and when specific needs present.  Following the establishment of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), all applications for assistive technology are submitted by school management to the Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) with assigned responsibility for the school.  The SENO examines applications and makes a recommendation to my Department.  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to a specific pupil is not readily identifiable.

Some financial institutions engaged in greater mortgage lending than others and would therefore contain larger mortgage portfolios.   Although the number of mortgages in arrears has risen, the number of repossessions remains low.The Deputy will appreciate that I will not comment on the contents of Budget 2011.   However, I can say that as part of the Government's commitments to Protecting the Family Home and Helping Those in Debt   under the Renewed Programme for Government, I established the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt last February to give effect to those commitments.The Mortgage Expert Group submitted its Interim Report to me in early July.  In general the recommendations of the Expert Group's Interim Report are intended to improve communication between householders in arrears and their lenders; provide for a more consistent assessment process by lenders of borrowers in difficulty and introduce an industry-wide Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) including a range of forbearance measures. The recommendations have been accepted in full by the Government and implementation is under way.I expect to receive a further Report from the Group very shortly.Finally, I can assure you that it remains the Government's objective that home owners who are in difficulty should be assisted to retain their homes.

The Deputy is aware credit unions are independent financial institutions with full responsibility and control over their own funds.  It is open to credit unions to invest surplus funds as they see fit provided that such loans or investments are made in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997.  As Minister for Finance I do not have a role in making recommendations to credit unions on where they might invest their funds.Section 55 of the Credit Union Act 1997 sets out details of the functions of the board of directors of a credit union.  This includes the making of decisions on applications for loans and decisions in respect of the investment of funds of the credit union. There are also obligations on boards on the general control, direction and management of the affairs, funds and records of their credit unions. In this context, the Registrar of Credit Unions requires credit unions to manage their business in a prudent manner and to comply with all regulatory requirements, guidance notes and circulars which he issues.The Deputy will also be aware that the conditions for registration as a credit union include having as one of the objects of the credit union the education of its members in their economic, social and cultural well-being as members of the community and the improvement of the well being and spirit of the members' community.  Section 44 of the Credit Union Act 1997 provides that a credit union, subject to the accompanying provisions in legislation, may establish a special fund to be used by the credit union for social, cultural or charitable purposes, including community development.

I further indicated that the tax treatment of retirement lump sums above €200,000 would be considered in the Government's National Pensions Framework. This position is reflected on page 41 of the Framework document published in March 2010 which states that "arrangements for the tax treatment of lump sums greater than €200,000 would be considered and developed during the implementation of this framework"As indicated in the National Pensions Framework, there are a number of fundamental issues which have yet to be considered in this process, including, among other things, the appropriate rate of tax (standard, higher or other) that should apply to lump sum payments in excess of €200,000.

Supplies that are in order and that have been invoiced in accordance with agreed arrangements are paid on average with a delay of only 8 days, which is comfortably within the Government policy objective of payment within 15 days and the usual period of credit allowed by suppliers. In that sense, therefore, no amount of money is owed to private firms.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	961	I presented a copy of the third and final report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children to Cabinet in early March. The Cabinet decided that, in view of the complex nature of the issues involved, all Ministers and Government Departments, as well as the Attorney General, should consider the report, and examine the implications of the proposed wording for their individual areas of responsibility.A range of unintended policy and resource implications were identified, including concerns that the concept of continuity of care might lead to children being left in inappropriate care situations. There were also concerns about implications for immigration policy, as someone due to be deported could claim it is in their child's interests that they remain in the country, and about the way in which the voice of the child provisions could lead to unwieldy and inappropriate arrangements; for example, where a child is being suspended from school it could result in legal representation being on both sides.In view of these difficulties, I was granted Government approval to develop a revised wording for an amendment, in co-operation with the Office of the Attorney General.  The new wording, which takes into account the proposals put forward by the Committee, is being drafted by the Attorney General's Office, with policy support provided by my Office. It is hoped that a recommendation will be brought to Cabinet very soon.The matter is receiving full attention. Meetings have taken place between myself, the Tánaiste, the Attorney General, and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, with a view to moving a proposal forward, and officials from my Office have met staff from the Attorney General's Office this week for discussions on the proposed wording.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	962	The Implementation Plan approved by Government, arising from the findings of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse committed to the recruitment of an additional 270 social workers before the end of   2011.The Government provided an amount of €15m in 2010 to advance the actions in the Implementation Plan, including the recruitment of an additional 200 social work posts in 2010. The recruitment of these additional social workers was provided for in the HSE Service Plan 2010. The filling of social work vacancies and the recruitment of additional social workers was exempted from the current public sector recruitment moratorium.The latest available information from the HSE's Employment Census for September, shows an increase of 93 social work posts in 2010, an increase of 43 over the figure for August. The HSE has advised that there is a time lag between individuals taking up duty and their inclusion in the HSE Employment Census. In this regard the HSE has further advised that contracts have issued in respect of all 200 approved posts. My Department has been assured by the HSE that all 200 additional social workers will be in place by year end.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	963	The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the regulatory body for pharmacy in Ireland, issued new guidance to pharmacists on the safe supply of non-prescription products containing codeine on the 1st of August 2010.  All pharmacists and retail pharmacy businesses are required to comply with this guidance.Codeine is a controlled drug listed in the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961. If inappropriately used it can be associated with dependence or reduced effect over time. According to the National Drug Treatment Reporting System, maintained by the Health Research Board, the numbers entering treatment for codeine as a problem drug have increased considerably, from 40 in 1998 to 180 in 2009. This is an indicator that the use of codeine can cause dependence.  In addition, between 1998 and 2007, codeine, either alone or in conjunction with another drug, was implicated in the cause of 90 fatal poisonings.  These data are based on data from the National Drug-Related Deaths Index.Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003, as amended, codeine-containing medicinal products are ordinarily subject to prescription control. However, at specified lower strengths, codeine-containing products may be supplied without a prescription "by or under the personal supervision of a pharmacist". The PSI guidance is intended to assist pharmacists in carrying out their legal and professional responsibility by engaging with patients to ensure that the product is the most suitable product for the patient in the circumstances.The guidance requires pharmacists to engage personally with patients and to exercise their professional judgement in consultation with the patient when deciding if a codeine-containing medicinal product is the most appropriate treatment or whether another product would be more suitable for the patient.Under the statutory Code of Conduct for Pharmacists, pharmacists are required to act at all times to maintain and improve the health, well-being and safety of patients, and also to comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and rules. It is a pharmacist's duty to act at all times in the best interest of the patient.  Breaches of the Code of Conduct for Pharmacists may result in a fitness to practice complaint against a pharmacist or pharmacy.I welcome the steps being taken by the PSI to increase patient safety and awareness with regard to the use of codeine products and the increase in the interaction between the pharmacy profession and the public.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	964	Under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, a relevant person or a connected person as defined in the Act was entitled to apply for a repayment under the scheme.A relevant person is a person who was charged and paid recoverable health charges.A connected person includes the following:(a) a person who has been nominated in writing by the relevant person,(b) the Registrar of Wards of Court if the relevant person is a ward of court,(c) a person with an enduring power of attorney in respect of the relevant person,(d) a next friend appointed by a court,(e) the HSE if none of the aforementioned is applicable to the relevant person, and the relevant person is unable to make an application due to a physical or mental disability or ill-health,(f) a living spouse or living child of the relevant person who has paid recoverable health charges on behalf of the relevant person.In regard to patients in the care of the HSE who were deemed by a medical practitioner not to have sufficient mental capacity to understand the scheme and for whom there was no other connected person as defined in the legislation, the HSE made application to the Scheme Administrator for a repayment on their behalf.  As provided for in the legislation, all such payments made in respect of HSE applications were lodged to the patient's own private property account.  The legislation also provides that an application may be made to a judge of the Circuit Court for the repayment to be made otherwise than to the patient's private property account.Where monies have been lodged to a patient's private property account, the HSE ensures that this money is used only for the benefit of the patient. All funds held in a patient's private property account are the property of that patient and are retained for the exclusive use of the patient. In the case of the individual concerned there is an agreed process in place between the care centre and the HSE to transfer funds when required for the patients' comforts.  The HSE is always happy to involve interested family members in the management of each patient's finances, so as to ensure that the patient's available funds are used to best effect in providing benefit to the patient concerned.

I laid that Report before the Houses of the Oireachtas in October 2009.Having regard to the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into ChildAbuse, officials from my Office met with the HSE earlier this year to discuss how the Section 8 Report could be enhanced and how the information now becoming available   can be used in HSE performance reports submitted to the Department. I want future Section 8 Reports to demonstrate the Health Service Executive's ability to evaluate its own services, so the report has to contain not only data and descriptive information, but also good analysis of this. The report should be of use to the HSE itself in evaluating its year's work and identifying what has been achieved, what is working well and what is problematic or insufficient. I also want some indication in the report of how resources have been used by the HSE and to what effect; what the staffing situation is; and as much emphasis on Family Support as on Child Protection and Child Care.A template for the drafting of future Section 8 Reports has now been agreed with the HSE and I  expect  to be provided with the 2009 Section 8 Report  by the end of this year.  It has also been agreed that future reports will be produced in a timely fashion.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	967	The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (the "Croke Park Agreement") provides a framework for public service management and staff to work together to deliver an ongoing reduction in the cost of delivery of public services, while maintaining and improving the quality of services delivered to the public, in return for commitments on pay and security of employment for public servants.  The Implementation Body has been established to drive the implementation of the Agreement across all sectors and ensure that early, robust and verifiable reforms are secured, which lead to sustainable and verifiable savings in the cost of public service delivery.The Health Sector Action Plan, which was developed by my Department working closely with the HSE, recognises that the Public Service Agreement enables the Health Sector to protect services to patients/users, in as far as is possible, within the context of whatever expenditure decisions are made by Government for 2011 and subsequent years.  The Plan also takes account of the fact that the implementation of reform is a dynamic process, and one which will allow identification of changes which may be required in the way services are delivered and the associated changes in work practices, on an ongoing basis.The Health Sector Implementation Body (HSIB) is responsible for driving the implementation of the Action Plan and will be required to report on progress to the Implementation Body.  Local structures are also being put in place at regional level across the HSE to help to drive implementation of the Public Service Agreement at a regional level and report progress to the HSIB.On 1 November 2010, I announced that the Government has decided to approve a voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme and a voluntary redundancy scheme (VRS) for certain categories of staff in the public health service.  The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.  As the Public Service Agreement commits all parties to the reduction of public servants and provides for Government to offer voluntary mechanisms to exit the Public Service, there is no need to amend the Agreement, as the Deputy has suggested.The VER and VRS schemes are open to employees management and administrative staff and general support staff but priority will be given to management and administrative grades.  The exact grades covered by the two schemes are set out in detail in the relevant Circular (Circular 7/2010).  There is general acceptance of the need to reduce the numbers of management and administrative staff in the health service.  For that reason, all applications from management and administrative staff to avail of the schemes will be approved.  Approval for applications from support staff will depend on the numbers of management and administrative staff who apply and the overall cap on costs not being breached.I am happy to report that there is a high level of interest in the schemes.  However it is not possible to predict, as yet, to what extent the current level of enquiries will translate into actual applications ahead of the closing date of 19 November.Health service employers will be looking to the provisions of the Croke Park agreement to ensure they continue to deliver services with reduced numbers and I understand that an engagement with the relevant trade unions has already begun.  While the implementation of the schemes will challenge the health service over the coming months, I believe that it will lead to a more efficient health service in the long term.

Eligible staff in St. Luke's Hospital are included in these schemes.The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.  The Government has decided that funding of up to €400 million will be made available in 2010 to fund the up-front costs of both schemes.The VER and VR schemes are open to management and administrative staff and general support staff but priority will be given to management and administrative grades.  The exact grades covered by the two schemes are set out in detail in the relevant Circular (Circular 7/2010).Employees in the eligible groups have up to 19 November 2010 to submit completed application forms under the relevant scheme.  All applicants whose application is approved must confirm their acceptance of the offer by the 30 November 2010 and their decision is irrevocable from that date.  The absolute deadline for departure from the health service under either scheme is 30 December 2010.

My Department has not entered into any negotiations, formal or informal, regarding the sale of the hospital.As I stated during the Oireachtas debate on the legislation, it was never my intention that the St Luke's site would be sold.  Accordingly, the Act provides in Section 6(5) that the HSE shall use the St Luke's property for the purposes of the delivery of health and personal social services and in Section 6(6) that the HSE may not dispose of the property without the consent of the Minister.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	975	I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 to 144, inclusive, together.The Health Service Executive (HSE), with my full support, decided to centralise the processing of all medical cards and GP visit card applications and renewals to its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.In January 2009, the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  In September 2009, the processing of all applications from two Local Health Offices in Dublin transferred to the PCRS.Completed applications received in the central office are being processed in 15 working days.  I understand that a backlog of medical card applications has accrued in some Local Health Offices and I have asked the HSE to address this issue as a matter of urgency.In June 2010, the HSE introduced a new website, www.medicalcard.ie, which enables people anywhere in the country to apply for a medical card through a simple and efficient on-line application process.  On-line assessments are immediate and for applicants who supply all evidence/documentation and are eligible on income grounds, medical card delivery is guaranteed within 15 days of receipt of the completed application pack.  The HSE has also made provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately.  The PCRS is receiving approximately 3,000 applications each week via this new channel, with more than 50% of these being made outside normal office hours.Significant progress has been made in this national project in providing an improved service to the public at less cost to the State.  Up to 8th October 2010, the PCRS has received 211,801 medical card applications and reviews and issued 171,237 medical cards.The next phase of the project will move the processing of all new applications to the Central Office following a consultative process with staff representatives in line with the recent agreement on pay and reform in the public service.As the centralisation process continues, more initiatives will be introduced and the current initiatives will be further enhanced as the HSE receives feedback and continues to engage closely with advocacy groups, staff, public representatives and primary care contractors.When the centralisation process is finalised (estimated completion date is 31st March 2011), staff in the Local Health Offices will continue to have access to the national system and will be available to help clients with enquiries about their application or review and will also be able to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme.  Completion of the centralisation process will result in some Local Health Office staff being available for redeployment to the central office or key front-line services (e.g. Primary Care Teams).As information regarding average waiting times for medical card applications in Local Health Offices is not returned to my Department as a matter of routine, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

No. 488 of 2008).The Regulations, which I made in November 2008, require that all retail pharmacy businesses provide a separate, designated, conveniently located area for patient consultation within the pharmacy premises.  A transition period of two years from November 2008 until November 2010 was provided for pharmacies already in operation to make arrangements for a private consultation area in their premises.  There is no exemption to the requirement to provide a separate consulting area within a pharmacy.The purpose of private consultation areas is to facilitate private and confidential conversation between patient and pharmacist regarding the patient's medication and other health matters.  It is essential that patients are afforded the privacy they require in order to engage with their pharmacist regarding their medicines.  In addition, patients should be encouraged to avail of private consultation areas to obtain the information and advice from the pharmacist regarding their medicines and other health matters.The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the regulatory body for pharmacy in Ireland, issued new guidance to pharmacists on patient consultation areas to facilitate compliance with the Regulations.  The PSI's guidance sets out the criteria to be adhered to by pharmacists, with a view to ensuring the provision of a designated patient consultation area which is appropriate, accessible, safe and allows for private discussions between pharmacist and patient.  The security and safety of the patient and the pharmacist is paramount and is addressed in the PSI guidance.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	990	I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 to 164, inclusive, and 183 to 185, inclusive, together.The Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme was established following an Inquiry into peripartum hysterectomy at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark S.C.Judge Clark was requested by the Government to advise on an appropriate scheme of redress arising from the findings of the Report.  Having received Judge Clark's advice, the Government approved the establishment of a non-statutory ex gratia scheme of redress in 2007, and appointed Judge Clark as its chairperson.The Lourdes Hospital Inquiry did not extend to a wider examination of Mr. Neary's general practice or the clinical practice of his colleagues. However, Judge Clark became aware during the course of the inquiry that some patients of Mr. Neary had undergone bilateral oophorectomies — that is, the removal of both ovaries or a single remaining ovary — that may not have been clinically warranted. The inquiry also received medical reports from women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy with relatively little evidence that the procedures were warranted.Judge Clark took advice on a selection of oophorectomy cases involving younger women treated by Mr. Neary. She was advised that while it is sometimes necessary to remove both ovaries in the presence of serious disease, the occasion of such a radical procedure is not common. This led her to conclude that unwarranted oophorectomies performed by Mr. Neary on women aged under 40 be included within the scope of the Redress Scheme.  The Scheme was advertised on 14th June 2007.The Lourdes Hospital Redress Board, chaired by Judge Clark has concluded its work and all awards determined have been notified to successful applicants. I have met with representatives of the women referred to by the Deputies on a number of occasions, to discuss issues of concern to them.I was asked to consider an extension of the scope of the Scheme to include additional former patients of Mr. Neary outside of the terms of the Scheme.  I gave due consideration to the request and consulted with Judge Clark in the matter who advised against an extension. Acting on this advice,  I decided against an extension of the Scheme and this was publicly communicated in November 2008.The Government believes that the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme addressed the matter in as sensitive and timely a manner as possible.  It was always the Government's intention that the women who qualified for the Scheme would receive adequate recompense and I believe that that has been achieved in a fair and reasonable manner.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	998	Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) continue to be a challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here continues to be a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).In March 2007, the HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan.  Over the period of the Plan the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  The number of MRSA bloodstream infections across the public and private hospital sector for the past five years are 592 cases in 2005, 592 in 2006, 536 in 2007, 439 in 2008, 355 in 2009 and 176 for the first two quarters of 2010 (provisional per the Health Protection Surveillance Centre as of 01/09/2010).  This shows a decrease of 40% between 2005 and 2009.  Reported figures for the first two quarters of 2010 when compared to the first two quarters of 2009 (195 cases) show a 10% decrease.           Since May 2008, C. difficile   is a notifiable disease: all cases have to be reported to the relevant Department of Public Health.  Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C. difficile-associated disease were published in May 2008.  Reported figures from May 2008 to December 2008 show 1624 cases (average of 46 per week), 1914 in 2009 (average of 37 per week) and 1385 from Jan to Oct 2010 (average of 33 per week). Data on alcohol hand gel usage which is an important part of the hygiene effort shows a twofold increase from 2006 to 2009.  The Guidelines for antimicrobial Stewardship in Hospitals in Ireland   aims to promote the sensible prescribing of antibiotics.  Data on antibiotic consumption collected by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) shows a welcome decrease in antibiotic consumption in Hospitals in 2008 for the first time since 2000.  Data for 2009 and the first 2 quarters of 2010 see this trend continuing.In May 2009, I also approved publication of the Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA's) National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.  These Standards include all key areas of importance in the control of HCAIs and the HSE is well advanced in its preparations for HIQA to commence its initial monitoring review under the Standards later this year.In addition to the above mentioned developments, in December 2008, the HSE published new Environmental Building Guidelines to inform control policy in all new builds and refurbishments. I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of Healthcare Associated Infections, including MRSA and C. difficile   and to treat them promptly when they occur.

In 2009, the Registry published An Atlas of Cancer in Ireland 1994-2003. That report described variations in cancer risk (incidence) at electoral district level in Ireland, with the objectives of investigating geographical variation; examining the relationships between area-based characteristics (such as population density) and cancer risk; and attempting to explain these relationships through the examination of area-based measures of socio-economic status and aspects of lifestyle. The report is available from the Registry and can be viewed on the Registry's website at www.ncri.ie.Data from the Registry, together with data from sources such as the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry database, was used in deciding the configuration of cancer centres under the National Cancer Control Programme.Cancer research forms a large part of the research programme in Ireland today.  The National Cancer Control Strategy noted that cancer research is an essential component in the development, implementation and evaluation of a national cancer control programme. The Health Research Board (HRB) is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research and is the main channel of public funding for research at national level. The HRB has invested nearly €50 million in cancer research since 2005. This includes the development of a network of cancer clinical trials in 17 hospitals across Ireland in conjunction with the All-Ireland National Cancer Institute Cancer Consortium. Other sources of health research funding are varied and include voluntary bodies (e.g. Irish Cancer Society) and others.

This development of radiotherapy services nationally is being achieved on a phased basis.  Under Phase 1, new facilities at St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital are almost ready with fit-out to be completed by year-end. Together with St Luke's in Rathgar, these new facilities will form the St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network for Dublin Mid-Leinster and Dublin North-East. Some staff and resources will transfer from St Luke's to the new sites while additional staff, mainly radiation therapists, are also being recruited. To facilitate the operation of the Network, St Luke's was integrated into the HSE on 1 August this year.  Under Phase 2, the facilities at St James's, Beaumont, Cork and Galway will be further developed and satellite centres will be developed at Limerick and Waterford. It is intended that services at the existing facility in St Luke's in Dublin will have transferred in full to Beaumont and St James's by the end of 2014.  The location of radiotherapy facilities has been chosen based on expert advice and in line with best international practice. It ensures that radiation oncology is integrated with other modalities of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke's.  However, I am committed to ensuring that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services.

Furthermore, additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 12 weeks.

This decision was conveyed to the person concerned by letter dated 4 August 2010.A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008.I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question 138 on 18 June, 2009 in which I advised him that on examination of the application submitted it was determined that the application form had not been fully completed.  It was returned to the person in question for further attention on 18 April, 2008.  The person in question returned the application form to the Citizenship Division but the application form was returned again to the applicant on 1 July, 2008 as the application form was still incomplete.  The Citizenship Division of my Department wrote to the person in question on 16 October, 2008 requesting she return her completed application form and supporting documentation in order for her application to be processed further.  A 21 day letter was issued on 22 January, 2009.  To date the Citizenship Division of my Department has not received the requested documentation and the application has been deemed ineligible. It is open to the person in question to lodge a new application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of both applications is ongoing and the files will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The first named person received a Long Term Residency permission from the General Immigration Division on the 23 February 2005.  He subsequently applied for a Without Condition As To Time endorsement on the 8 May 2008 and received it on the 9 May 2008.  Records with the Garda National Immigration Bureau indicate that he currently has the endorsement until 4 February 2014.Officials in the Long-Term Residency section of my Department inform me that the second named person was granted a Stamp 4 for 5 years.  A letter informing her of this issued on 16 June 2008.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

I would like to confirm that there have been no new developments in this case since that time. Our Honorary Consul in Phuket has been in e-mail contact with the father offering to meet with him to discuss the case but, to date, she has received no response.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1042	The Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, also known as the "Brahimi Report", which was published in 2000, charted a renewed vision for UN peacekeeping that helped make peacekeeping stronger, more effective and comparatively cost-efficient.  It addressed many challenges and set down principles which remain central to modern peacekeeping today.   In the intervening years, there has been an ongoing dialogue on the future perspectives for peacekeeping.  Ireland has been an active participant in these discussions.  In addition, Ireland has continued to support international peacekeeping and crisis management through its participation in the field. In 2009 the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field Support published a paper setting out the "New Horizon”   Initiative, which outlined the complex and evolving nature of demands placed on UN peacekeeping and the steps required to strengthen peacekeeping to meet emerging challenges.  The first “Progress Report of the New Horizon Initiative” was discussed at the General Assembly’s Fourth Committee on 22 October 2010.  Along with our European Union partners, Ireland expressed support for the ongoing reform process.   Ireland is strongly supportive of the UN’s role in peacekeeping and is anxious that this be conducted as effectively and efficiently as possible.  For that reason we will continue to play an active part, along with our European Union partners, in discussions within the UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping and the General Assembly’s Fourth Committee. In May 2010, building on their extensive experience of peacekeeping operations, Ireland and Finland organised a seminar on “Modern Challenges in Peace Operations”.  This event was attended by a senior official with the UN’s Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and other high level experts.  Further information on the event is available on the Department’s website at:http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=311

The attached tables set out, for both Votes, the details of reports commissioned by the Department in 2008, 2009 and to date in 2010 and the costs in each case.The table includes 4 reports on the EU which I requested the Department to commission prior to and post the Lisbon Treaty Referendum in 2009.  All the other reports, and those listed in Vote 29, were requested from various divisions in my Department.   Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), occasionally commissions outside expertise in cases where the specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department.  During the course of their engagements these consultants/experts may prepare documentation. However, as they would not have been commissioned specifically to furnish a report, these details have not been included in the table.In addition to the information provided in tabular form, the establishment of a Hunger Task Force was one of the recommendations of the White Paper on Irish Aid published in September 2006. The aim of the Hunger Task Force is to identify the additional, appropriate and effective contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger. The first meeting of the Hunger Task Force took place in Dublin on 14th September 2007. The Hunger Task Force reported in September 2008, and outlined a number of key actions which Ireland can take to give practical leadership internationally on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of those who suffer from hunger by 2015.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1045	Department is responsible for two votes — Votes 28 (Foreign Affairs) and 29 (International cooperation — Irish Aid). Expenditure on public relations and advertising arises under subhead A3 on both votes.    Advertising undertaken by my Department typically includes: advisory notices on public opening hours over holiday periods, changes in passport application procedures and fees, and public information notices relating to significant developments in the European Union (such as the Lisbon Treaty) or in regard to Ireland's Official Development Assistance programme, Irish Aid. While much of this material is now placed on the Department's website, a certain level of advertising continues to be necessary in order to reach all of our customers, particularly in relation to important passport and consular services. Details of advertising expenditure per year for both votes are included in the table below.From time to time, public relations initiatives are undertaken by my Department. These arise in very specific circumstances where the Department carries out information and awareness-raising campaigns. In 2009 an initiative was undertaken for a public information campaign to inform on and promote awareness of the EU and Ireland's membership of the EU. Two initiatives were undertaken on development issues relating to the management of Africa Day (2008, 2009 and 2010) and the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (2010). Details of expenditure per year are included in the table below.AdvertisingPublic RelationsVote 28Vote 29Vote 28Vote 292008259,805378,126—34,485200978,97246,015560,40763,0582010 to-date24,73018,978—78,832In addition to this, the network of Irish diplomatic missions abroad occasionally incurs some limited expenditure on advertising and public relations. This would include advertising of Embassy opening hours, changes to consular services, promotion of Irish cultural events, etc.I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on such expenditure, and as with all expenditure appropriate financial controls and regulations are in place.

It is not possible to say how many tenants pay their rent to a letting agent.Legislation does, however, provide for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient. This arrangement is generally at the tenant's request and is subject to the consent of the Health Service Executive. The proportion of rent supplement payments which are paid to a person other than the recipient is 20%.

The survey results provide, inter alia, figures on the overall number of dwellings in unfinished housing developments on a county by county basis and the number of such dwellings that are completed and vacant.A high-level Expert Group is currently developing measures effectively to address unfinished housing developments, including a guidance manual and Code of Practice for managing and resolving issues in these developments for implementation by key stakeholders.  It is expected that the guidance manual will be published very shortly as a consultation draft which will, inter alia  , identify the type of developments and issues that need to be prioritised for action in the short term; the final manual and Code of Practice will be published early next year.

My Department's role is to ensure that such guidance is brought to the attention of bodies under its aegis, including local authorities.With specific reference to the scheme mentioned, the local authority concerned has advised my Department that it will rigorously enforce compliance with the obligations of the contract, including tax compliance requirements and in accordance with the Registered Agreement for the Construction Industry.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1071	My Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010 — 2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, includes a contract for waste water treatment plants and associated networks for the Belmullet, Foxford and Charlestown Sewerage Scheme to advance to construction during the period of the Programme at an estimated cost of €14.3 million.My Department expects to issue its decision on Mayo County Council's design brief for the appointment of consultants to advance the procurement of the three wastewater treatment plants and associated works under a single Design Build Operate (DBO) contract before the end of the year.  This decision will also assist the Council to determine the scale and scope of the works to be carried out on the collection systems at the three locations, and whether to incorporate those works into the DBO contract or to procure them under separate contracts.I understand that the Council has already carried out some works required for the preparation of contract documents for the Foxford and Charlestown collection systems.  A set of contract documents have already been developed for the Belmullet collection system by the Council and submitted to my Department as outlined in the reply to Question No. 214 of 4 November 2010.  The parallel work on the design brief and the Council's decision on the procurement strategy for the overall scheme will have to be factored into my Department's consideration of this set of contract documents.In addition, my Department's assessment of the Council's two foreshore licence applications for the Belmullet scheme is substantially complete but any decision on them must await the Environmental Protection Agency's decision on the Council's wastewater discharge licence application for the Belmullet plant.  I understand that the Council has also applied to the Agency for wastewater discharge licences for the Foxford and Charlestown plants.  As the discharge licences are matters to be dealt with between the Council and the Agency, further information on progress with those applications may be had from the Council.In essence, Mayo County Council must await the grant of the foreshore and discharge licences before it can issue the certificate of completion of planning for the proposed contract and progress the appropriate contract documentation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1072	The law in relation to the taxation of goods vehicles has not changed.To be taxed as a goods vehicle, a vehicle must be constructed or adapted for that purpose and used solely in the course of trade or business, including agriculture.  If a vehicle is adapted, it must have the same characteristics as a goods vehicle in relation to space and accommodation for carrying goods and it must have limited seating capacity.  In effect, this means that in order to be taxed in the goods category, the goods-carrying area of the vehicle must be greater than the seating area; all seats to the rear of the driver's seat must be removed and seat bolt holes welded over and all rear seat belts must be removed and seat belt anchor points welded over.  There are no such restrictions if a vehicle is taxed privately.Under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992, a licensing authority must be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed, and it is thus open to a motor tax office to seek additional documentation supporting a claim for the goods rate of motor tax.  Such documentation may include a certificate of commercial insurance or evidence of registration for VAT purposes, or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other appropriate document.Under section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is used in a condition or manner which would attract motor tax at a higher rate, tax then becomes payable at that rate.  In other words, if a goods vehicle is used in a private capacity, it must, like all other private vehicles, be taxed at the private rate of motor tax.Application of the law in particular cases is a matter for the motor tax authorities.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1073	I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 258 together.Deer may only be hunted under licence by my Department. The open season for most deer species, including Red, Fallow and Sika, operates annually from 1 September to 28 February, depending on the gender and age of deer.    The hunting of red male deer is prohibited in the county of Kerry during the open season and these deer can only be hunted under a permission issued under Section 42 of the Wildlife Acts.The Kerry red deer population is regarded as of national significance because of the likelihood that they may be descended from native populations of red deer, whereas other red deer herds in the country are known to be from introduced stock. The Kerry red deer population is considered to be in good status.The control of deer is primarily a matter for the land owner; proper deer management requires controlling the numbers of both male and female deer.   Section 42 of the Wildlife Acts offers a facility whereby a person can obtain permission, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer or groups of deer on specific lands, and permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.  Should such damage be caused by male deer, it would be appropriate to allow a number of stags to be removed from the herd involved.There has been no change in the licensing regime.My Department is actively taking measures to combat deer poaching around the country.    I understand that the organisation in question has a particular concern that the Section 42 permissions issued for red male deer in county Kerry are been used to encourage trophy hunting.  My Department will arrange to meet with the organisation in the next few weeks to discuss this issue and other matters raised in its letter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1074	Under the EU Birds Directive, Ireland is required to designate Special Protection Areas for the most important areas used by birds, especially migratory or rare species. The European Court of Justice has determined that all important areas used by birds must be designated. In Ireland, many of the most important areas are bays and estuaries used by large flocks of migrant birds in the winter months.Under the EU Habitats Directive, Ireland is further required to designate the best sites for 7 different marine habitats, including large shallow inlets and bays, and sandbanks, as Special Areas of Conservation (SACS). SACs are also required for a number of marine species, including the harbour porpoise, the bottle-nosed dolphin and both the grey and harbour seal.  In March 2009, the European Commission held a review of the SACs proposed by all Atlantic coast Member States and required Ireland to carry out further work in regard to sandbanks, dolphins and porpoises in particular.My Department is currently finalising work on what is necessary to meet the requirements of the EU Directives and I will publish a list of any additional sites required as soon as possible.The percentage of coastline designated was calculated by my Department by estimating the length of the high tide line with a designated area on the seaward side of the tideline. Using an estimate of 8,400 km as the length of the Irish tide line, it is estimated that 62% borders on a designated area.The length of coastline is not a criterion used in the designation process and there is no set target.

Section 4(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out certain broad categories of development that are exempted developments for the purposes of the Act.  Section 4(1)(h) provides that development consisting of the carrying out of works for the maintenance, improvement or other alteration of any structure is exempted development if the works affect only the interior of the structure or do not materially affect the external appearance of the structure so as to render the appearance inconsistent with the character of the structure or of neighbouring structures.  The interpretation and application of the legislation is a matter for the planning authorities in the first instance.This advice is available on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland website, www.seai.ie  .Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  I have no role in the matter.  Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.

In May 2010 the Agency was established on an administrative basis.  It is intended that HSCA will be given full legislative underpinning next year.It is not proposed that any specific housing functions will be devolved by my Department to the Agency, the principle objective of which is to work with and assist my Department and local authorities in the provision of housing services. Its functions will include the following:[a] within a shared service environment, to assist local authorities in the discharge of their functions under housing, planning and building control legislation, [b] to facilitate, advise and assist housing authorities, approved housing bodies and my Department in the formulation and implementation of housing policy,[c] to carry out research and analysis, and to disseminate information to housing practitioners and the wider public, [d] to undertake such duties or such other services as are requested of it by myself or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.At present the Agency continues to carry out some remaining activities previously under the remit of the Affordable Homes Partnership and the Centre for Housing Research, such as, for example, the conduct of credit checks for local authority loans, the preparation of guidance for local authorities in relation to the disposal of affordable housing and the carrying out of housing research. In addition, the Agency is supporting the promotion of the social housing leasing initiative, is helping to source accommodation for homeless persons and, through Housing and Sustainable Communities Ltd., is administering the Land Aggregation Scheme. From 1 January 2011 it is expected that a broader range of the proposed functions for the Agency will be taken on.Notwithstanding that the Agency has only been established on an administrative basis, it subscribes to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1077	For some time now the social housing investment programme has been undergoing a significant restructuring to shift the focus increasingly towards more flexible delivery mechanisms, including through the introduction of long term leasing arrangements, with a lesser reliance on construction and acquisition. This is in line with the reform agenda clearly set out under the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.I am confident that there is a considerable supply of suitable available vacant accommodation around the country which can be made available for leasing. This is evidenced by the sourcing of almost 2,800 units, to the end of October 2010, and of these almost 1,000 are operational with agreements signed. I expect further substantial numbers of units to be provided in the years ahead to meet housing needs.My Department has engaged the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency to provide on-going support and advice to local authorities on the leasing initiative, in general and also on an individual project basis. Given the work which my Department has undertaken to support the leasing initiative and its extension to include the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, and given the impact of the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency, I am satisfied that a solid basis is being put in place to support increased delivery under the initiative.

Regulations which will set out the detailed provisions of the assessment process will be made later this year. They will include provisions on—how applications for social housing should be made including which authority an applicant may apply to;the manner in which an authority will conduct housing needs assessments;the criteria for determining eligibility for social housing support ;the determination of what form of social housing should be provided;when a housing authority should carry out an update or review of a social housing assessment; andrules for carrying out the statutory summary of social housing assessments.The regulations will provide a standard approach to the carrying out of assessments across all housing authorities.In September 2010, my Department issued a circular letter to housing authorities advising them of the intention to undertake an assessment of need as of 31 March 2011.

The specific allocations for each authority are informed by both the level of contractual commitments for the following year and the extent of social housing need in each authority's functional area. Following the notification of allocations to all local authorities at the start of the year, my Department then monitors drawdown on a continual basis through direct engagement at official level.Each year as part of the Housing Action Plan (HAP) review process my Department meets twice with each housing authority, in spring and autumn, to discuss their social housing programmes.In January, prior to the spring HAP meetings, my Department issues provisional allocations and expenditure projections. These figures are to be used as the basis for the operational programmes for housing authorities and are discussed at the spring HAP meetings.The primary purpose of the spring 2010 HAP meeting was to:agree the work programme for the year;confirm financial and physical outputs;outline the parameters within which the investment programmes for 2011 — 2013 are to be prepared; andagree a list of projects that have been deferred until such time as budgetary conditions improve to enable these projects to advance.Final allocations are issued after the spring HAP meeting and all local authorities are advised of their allocation under each of the social housing programmes.The primary purpose of the autumn 2010 HAP meeting was to:confirm financial and physical output for the current year, including progress under the Social Leasing Initiative; andfurther outline the parameters within which the investment programmes for 2011 — 2013 are to be prepared.Additionally, the HAP process is supplemented by continuous and ongoing engagement between my Department and the Local Authorities.Local authorities also receive a monthly statement of expenditure which clearly shows drawdown in monetary terms by subhead item and the percentage of their allocations drawn down to date.

To date, over 25,000 units of accommodation have been provided under my Department's funding schemes which provide up to 100% of the cost of the construction or acquisition of properties.The voluntary housing sector is centrally involved in the delivery of social housing units under my Department's Rental Accommodation Scheme and in the Social Housing Leasing Initiative. To date, almost 600 housing units have been approved for leasing by approved housing bodies.In order to facilitate the active involvement of approved housing bodies in all aspects of the provision, management and maintenance of social rented accommodation, my Department has issued a series of Circular Letters and Memoranda to the local authorities, outlining the procedures to be followed in this regard.

An Independent Assessment Panel quality assures the data submitted by the local authorities and their reports are contained in the annual service indicators reports.  Specifically, pages 22 to 24 of the Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2008   Report set out some of the factors which affect the average time taken to re-let available dwellings, together with actions taken by local authorities on the issues surrounding performance. The Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group   contains a number of recommendations in relation to the wider use of the service indicators and reducing the time to let and re-let social housing properties.  The Report’s recommendations in this regard will be considered by me with a view to improving performance generally.I propose to establish an implementation group, with an independent chairperson, to oversee implementation of relevant recommendations.

In keeping with this strategy, the reform programme, now well underway in my Department, involves a shift away from construction and acquisition towards a more graduated system of supports. This refocusing, in policy and financial terms, is rooted in the clearly articulated rationale set out in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.While the allocations for 2010 show a reduction in the provision for the main traditional local authority programme I anticipate that, through more flexible market based delivery mechanisms such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and long term leasing, as well as the significant increase in funding available under the Capital Assistance Scheme in 2010 to €145m, and the availability, shortly, of a direct lending facility from the Housing Finance Agency to approved housing bodies, delivery across the range of social housing measures in the future will continue the momentum built up over recent years.

Funding provided by my Department in this context relates to the recoupment of 90% of approved expenditure by housing authorities on accommodation for homeless persons, with the balance being funded from housing authorities' own resources. The HSE has responsibility for funding in relation to health and care services for homeless persons.Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities and decisions relating to particular services funded by them are matters for the relevant housing authorities in the first instance. The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. It is a matter for each housing authority to consider, having regard to needs, priorities and resources, what services should be funded, whether directly or through arrangements with non-statutory service providers, and to ensure that funding to address homelessness is appropriately and effectively used. In addition, under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the Management Group of the Homelessness Consultative Forum may make recommendations to housing authorities regarding services to address homelessness and funding for such services, taking into account the financial resources that are available or are likely to be available.Key criteria in the context of funding of homeless services include evidence of need and priority, having regard to the national homelessness strategy and regional action plans, the overall amount of resources available, and the objective of achieving the best possible outcome for homeless people.I understand that the service in question is currently receiving funding from the relevant housing authority and proposals to increase the service to 24 hours and from 8 to 16 beds have been agreed.   Agreement for additional funding for the increased service has been finalised between my Department and the housing authority concerned.  The necessary approval has now issued.

ComReg's website www.callcosts.ie   provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis including County Galway.While Government and the private sector have invested in broadband in the last number of years, I am aware that there continues to be a small number of individual premises throughout the country that are not capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.)The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme shortly.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.

The ‘All Island Grid Study', jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Northern Ireland,2. The ‘Generation Adequacy Report 2010–2016' published by EirGrid, and3. The ‘Low Carbon Generation Options for the All Island Market' published by EirGrid.EirGrid's latest ‘Generation Adequacy Report 2010–2016' contains a separate section describing the various means of electrical storage.  One of its conclusions is that there is little value in adding large pumped storage in Ireland at levels of renewable penetration up to 40%.  It further notes that it may be more economic to export wind than to store it using pumped hydro, because of the efficiency loss in the pumping cycle.The study commissioned by EirGrid on low carbon options for 2035 concluded that storage could make a contribution towards managing the intermittency associated with renewables in a portfolio with both interconnection and flexible generation, but that there were capital cost, environmental and technical issues that needed to be examined further.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1092	The provision of broadband services is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market.  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.I would stress to the Deputy that considerable progress is being made in relation to the provision and quality of broadband.  At the end of June 2010 Ireland had in the region of 1.48 million broadband subscriptions.  The year-on-year growth in subscriptions over the preceding 12 month period was over 16.5%.  Internationally, Ireland ranks 11th of the EU 27 for per-capita broadband penetration of both fixed and mobile, 4th for mobile only penetration, and 14th for fixed broadband penetration.Of the homes with broadband connections, 77.8% of them and 85.8% of SMEs are using broadband speeds between 2mbps and 10mbps.  UPC is providing speeds up to 30 Mbs and is rolling out speeds up to 100 Mbs.  Eircom and the Vodafone/BT alliance are both rolling out speeds of up to 24 Mbs using vDSL technology.  In the wireless market, Imagine have launched WiMAX, a broadband product with speeds of up to 8mbps available.  In addition Eircom has recently launched an Ethernet product offering speeds up to and exceeding 1Gbs to wholesale customers and to large broadband users.Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ie  .In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and which seek a service.I am pleased to say that under the NBS broadband is now available in all Electoral Divisions in the NBS Coverage Area.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.

The measures selected for inclusion in the scheme are considered to be the most optimum to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners at least cost and represent best use of budgetary resources.I am advised by the SEAI that the grant application process under the HES scheme requires that applicants accept the requirement that they must obtain all necessary consents, permissions and statutory approvals and have authority to install the measures in his or her home.  The SEAI does not audit compliance with this requirement as part of the application approval as it may not arise in all instances.  It is the responsibility of the homeowner to secure permits as may be required, and some applicants may choose to have grant approval in place before proceeding with planning permissions.  Obviously no grant is paid unless the work is certified as having being completed.The SEAI further advise that if there is any doubt as to whether the particular external insulation proposed will affect the character of the structure, the SEAI grant applicant is advised to contact their local planning authority to clarify the matter.  It is therefore a matter for individual local authorities, operating under the aegis of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to ascertain whether the application of external wall insulation comprises works as envisaged under the planning regulations and not a matter in which I have any function.The issue as to whether a standard approach can be taken by all local authorities is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

It is fully committed to complying with the terms of the Prompt Payment Regulations and also with the 2009 Government decision that all Departments commit to paying Irish suppliers within 15 days of receipt of valid invoices.In the year ending 31 October 2010, almost 83% of payments to suppliers and contractors were made within 15 days, some 13 % were paid within 16 to 30 days and 4 % were paid after 30 days of receipt of the invoices. Procedures are in place to process payments promptly and there is on-going monitoring and reporting to ensure that there are no payments owing to suppliers.In the year to 31 October 2010, the Department processed in the region of 48,000 invoices from Irish suppliers with a total value of approximately €106 million.

Public relations advice, where required is provided by my Department's Press Office. It is not possible to provide costs for this service, as the work is carried out as part of the standard duties of the staff involved.Following the Government announcement of 8 July 2008 that required all expenditure by Departments on consultancies, advertising and public relations would be significantly reduced for the remainder of that year and by at least 50% in 2009 compared with 2008 my Department's advertising costs have reduced substantially, in line with this announcement.The details sought by the Deputy in relation to the total spend on advertising in national and local print media, radio and television is set out below:YearValue2008€1.231m2009€490,6802010 (up to 31 Oct)€413,892

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.   The time limit for an employee to make application for a redundancy payment or to make a claim to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) in a situation where the employer disputes payment of redundancy is 52 weeks of ceasing employment   However, the EAT has the power to extend the deadline from 52 weeks to 104 weeks if satisfied that the delay by the employee in making the claim arose through reasonable cause. An application form "T1-A" may be used to make direct claims to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. This form is available on the EAT's website at  www.eatribunal.ie  .

The Director has powers to initiate company investigations, prosecutions, restrictions and disqualifications with a view to curbing relevant abusive practices by directors.In this regard it is important to distinguish between situations where directors restart a business following an orderly wind down of the previous enterprise, for example, by placing the company into liquidation; and where directors restart a business in disregard both of their duties under company law and their financial and other obligations to one or more of the stakeholders in a previous failed company.Section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 provides that the liquidator of an insolvent company must submit a report to the ODCE on its demise together with information on the conduct of any person who was a director of the company during the 12 months preceding its liquidation.  The liquidator must also proceed to apply to the High Court for the restriction of each of the directors of the insolvent company, unless relieved of that obligation by the ODCE.The ODCE has also been conferred with certain powers to address unliquidated insolvent companies i.e., those companies which are not in liquidation and have not yet been dissolved.  The legal powers include applying to the High Court for the restriction of the company's directors. This power has been successfully used to sanction directors.A restriction declaration, if made, prohibits an individual from acting, either directly or indirectly, as an officer of a company or from being involved in its formation or promotion for five years, unless the company is adequately capitalised.  In the case of a private company, the capital requirement is €63,487 in allotted paid-up share capital, which must be paid for in cash.  The equivalent figure for public companies is €317,435.The Director of Corporate Enforcement is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions.

These figures are 97.4% in number and 99.3% in value for all payments made within 30 days of receipt in my Department.

This reflects not only the legal obligation to pay within 30 days and the additional administrative requirement arising from a Government Decision to make payments within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice, but also recognises that it is important for suppliers to receive payments due without unnecessary delays.My Department normally makes payments to suppliers several times a week. In the year to date, over 90% of payments have been made within the 15 day period, with the bulk of the remainder paid within the 30 day window.Any invoices currently on hand that are due for payment to private firms have been received in the past few days and amount to less than €6,000. All of these amounts will be paid this week.

The legislation provides for the payment of interest on valid invoices that are unpaid after 30 days from their date of receipt. In June 2009, the Government introduced a further non-statutory requirement to reduce the payment period by central departments to 15 days.In the quarter ending September 2010 over 94% of valid invoices were paid by the Department of Defence within the 15 day timeframe and over 98% were paid within 30 days.  At any given time the Department has recently-received invoices on hand which are generally processed within a few days of receipt.  The number of invoices on hand at present is approximately 900, amounting to some €3m. These invoices will be processed for payment within the next 5 days.

Overall capital expenditure to date is in the order of €9.5m.Most of the Defence capital spending allocation is used on an on-going capital building programme designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to the Defence Forces. This programme focuses mainly on infrastructural projects such as the refurbishment of existing buildings and the construction of new buildings where required. The programme provides for new starts and the continuation of capital building projects already underway. The amount allocated for the capital building programme in 2010 was €12.9m.The remaining capital provision of €3.7m relates mainly to the purchase of computer equipment, licences and related items for the Department and the Defence Forces.I will write to the Deputy with details of the projects involved as soon as possible.
