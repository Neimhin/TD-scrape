#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Acting Leader recently asked the Leader to consider a debate on Northern Ireland. Has he been successful in getting a date for such a debate? It is important that the House debates Northern Ireland before the Christmas recess, in light of the very dramatic and drastic plans for alleged reform of local government announced yesterday by the Secretary of State, Peter Hain.This is a very serious issue. The Secretary of State wants to virtually abolish half of the local authorities in Northern Ireland and to create seven super authorities, three of which will be dominated by Nationalists and three by Unionists, with the one in the middle in Belfast being up for grabs.This is a dangerous repartition of Northern Ireland whereby local government will now be streamlined between the two great alleged tribes. It is clear the Secretary of State wants to put pressure on the parties to take responsibility and he is using this as a means of ensuring they take control at some point in the next 12 months or so. The House should debate this issue because it has serious ramifications.It is interesting that the only political party in favour of this sectarian carve-up is Sinn Féin, which speaks volumes. I ask the Acting Leader to organise a debate along those lines. Local government is one of the few aspects of government working in Northern Ireland. It provides an opportunity for Unionists, Nationalists, republicans and loyalists to come together and talk about local issues. While there is not much measure of responsibility in local government in Northern Ireland, it is working. We need to tread very carefully before this radical reform package is accepted by all sides.On a final matter, when the Navan bus disaster happened we all asked for a debate on the report once it was published. I understand the report cannot be published because of possible criminal proceedings in the case. Will the Acting Leader ascertain whether the five families affected will at least be given an opportunity of reading the report before it is published and when the matter is likely to be debated in the House? The issue of the safety of the school bus fleet is of concern to all Members.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	3	On a number of occasions recently we raised the question of crime and the involvement of the gardaí. The House should note the fact that over the past week the gardaí in Limerick, in particular, have been extraordinarily successful in making at least two, and possibly three, giant steps towards solving some of the difficulties there. It has been done by good policing and hard work. It proves the point that if enough gardaí are made available and put on the streets, an impact can be made on crime in the area.It is a major step forward that gardaí have reached a stage where the convicted killer of Mr. Brian Fitzgerald is prepared to turn State's evidence and they are working with Interpol and other agencies seeking the extradition of Mr. James Martin Cahill as well as tightening up on some of the others. It shows what can be done. It is the case for greater policing on the ground. This has been done in Limerick through a considerable influx of gardaí, the regular use of the Garda helicopter and other moves. It shows it is the way we need to move forward.A number of times recently I raised the importance of having a debate on alternative energy and yesterday Senator Coonan called for a debate on agriculture. The two matters could be debated together. We had better recognise that the outcome of the beet negotiations will only be a temporary bridge towards the end of the beet industry. Therefore, we should be looking at the alternatives for farmers and agriculture beyond that point. In particular, this ties in with the need to encourage through tax and other incentives farming communities, and farmers in the first place, to grow alternative crops like oilseed rape, to produce wood pellets for biomass energy and such like, and also to give encouragement to small rural communities to development wind energy farms that can create wealth. There is a significant amount that can be done in that area and we need to look creatively at it, giving the agricultural community hope for the future.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Apart from the scary fact that apparently the British Government is now reorganising Northern Ireland to suit Sinn Féin which, of itself, is fairly spooky, there is the extraordinary manner in which a prominent member of Sinn Féin's assembly party was suspended for recording dissent. If that were to apply here, the Leader of the House would have been sacked from Fianna Fáil a long time ago, as would a good number of the Members on the Government benches.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	9	No, it is not just for Sinn Féin. It is about what defines democracy. What we in this House and in the other House are asking Sinn Féin to do is establish credentials that it accepts the rules of democracy. If there is zero room for dissent within a political party, then it does not qualify. No political party of which I know in this State has suspended somebody simply for saying he or she does not agree with his or her party. Not even Fianna Fáil, under Charles J. Haughey at its most draconian, did that. As far as I am concerned the capitulation of the British Government and the sinister Mafiosi sense of omerta of Sinn Féin raise fundamental questions.

Last year it was announced that she is banning the publication of waiting lists until, presumably, they have rewritten them to suit their own convenience. There was the recent announcement that we do not need 3,000 extra acute beds and then there was the horrific story on the front page of last Monday's Irish Examiner which has been adequately aired.There are now reports that the publishing of the report into the extraordinary tragedy in Monaghan hospital will be late. Additionally, it is reported that the terms of reference for that investigation have still not been finalised.I want to know what the Tánaiste is doing because on every issue involving any sense of public crisis there is temporising, delay, revision and review. It is time we debated this issue. I would like the Tánaiste to come to the House to explain what she thinks she has achieved because to date all most people can see is the health service going backwards.

There are a number of issues that we need to discuss, in particular the point he raised regarding these new super councils to be established in the North.What surprised me about the proposal was that it seems to have come out of the blue. With most other proposals that impact on community life, there is generally a gestation period where people have an input and can make a contribution to the debate. What surprised me most of all is that most of the arguments being put forward in favour of the super councils are based on economics. It is stated, for instance, that the cost of governance and the cost of administration in the North of Ireland is one third higher than in the United Kingdom. However, there are much bigger issues because we all know that at the height of the Troubles it was the local councils that really provided the anchor because different parties there were prepared to sit down together and work for the betterment of the community. I would not like to see the partitionist mentality succeeding, if that is what is behind this. The debate, if possible, should take place before Christmas.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	13	As we are well aware, the Rossport five were jailed for 94 days. It is interesting that now an expert consultant has raised serious concerns about the safety of the pipeline running close to houses. Another disturbing issue which has emerged is that in 2003 the senior executives of Shell who were concerned about the ongoing delay in the planning process had an emergency meeting with the Taoiseach and two Ministers in order to fast-track the project through the planning process. There was a meeting arranged a week later with the chairman of An Bord Pleanála and the company subsequently got planning permission.I will outline the nature of my concern. An Bord Pleanála is an independent entity. My experience is that when one telephones on behalf of constituents inquiring about any part of a planning application, one will be told firmly about An Bord Pleanála's independence.While it is important for the country that this project goes ahead, safety is equally paramount. The safety concerns which have been raised disturb me and appear to vindicate the stance taken by the Rossport five.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I wish to raise a couple of issues. First, there was a fairly robust debate in the other House yesterday on cancer care services in Cork and the provision of an oncology ward. It transpires this morning, from listening to the manager of Cork University Hospital on the radio, that it is already in hand. Approval has already been given for such an oncology unit and building will commence next year.Previously I have sought debates on the issue of cancer care. There is a need for a dedicated oncology ward in Waterford as well. We should also debate the transport needs of patients going for radiotherapy treatment.I ask that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources come to the House to discuss a matter, which is happening year in, year out and about which nothing is done. A few weeks ago I had a difference of opinion with the Commodore of the Naval Service at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the way the Naval Service is policing fishing in Irish waters. The herring season has started again. I will give the House one example of what has happened and, as I stated, is replicated year in, year out. The dedicated landing port for herring is Ringaskiddy. I know of one boat that went to the Verolme Dockyard first to land four container loads of herring before sailing to Ringaskiddy to land its quota. That happened under the nose of the Naval Service. It is not the case that nobody knows this is going on, yet nothing is done about it. At the same time, I know of a poor man from my area who had four boxes of herring over the limit and was apprehended. There is not fair play in the system. It is time the matter was resolved. I would like the Minister of State with responsibility for marine affairs to come to the House to discuss the issue.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I am sure the House will agree — I speak not just as a member of the National Union of Journalists but as a human being — that it is remarkable a memorandum has now emerged clearly demonstrating that it took Tony Blair to persuade George Bush not to bomb the al-Jazeera studio in Qatar. The British are so worried about the memorandum that they have invoked section 5 of the Official Secrets Act to stop the matter being discussed.In light of this, I ask the Acting Leader to convene a meeting of the Government side, including the PDs, to discuss the appalling amendment put down against my Private Members' motion on Iraq for this evening. This question is directly relevant to the Order of Business. I ask this because, as I understand it, this matter has not been discussed among the Government Members, who have not yet had access to the amendment. It is notable that the only name on the Order Paper is that of the Leader, Senator O'Rourke.I ask my colleagues on the other side of the House not to sign this amendment because it refers, among other things, to the fact that the Government has permitted overflights for almost 50 years. That included the period of the Vietnam War, when the US authorities transported Agent Orange and phosphorous, which they are doing again in regard to Iraq. This is precisely why this disgraceful amendment should be removed.This matter went to Cabinet before coming back to the House but not one Member has yet had the opportunity to discuss it. Why are there no names of Government Members on the motion apart from that of Senator O'Rourke?

Instead of having this motion handed down from on high by people who are not elected to this House, with the names of Government Members to be added to it, this matter should be discussed by those Members. I ask them not to permit their names to be added to this motion, which would validate the use of Agent Orange and phosphorusbombs. It is a most craven and disgusting amendment.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I join with Senators Brian Hayes and Ó Murchú in seeking a debate on Northern Ireland. Apart from the local government issue, other aspects can usefully be discussed at this stage. Advances have been made in recent months but the interplay between North and South, North-South bodies and interparliamentary co-operation are fundamental areas for discussion.The proposed changes to local government should be discussed in that debate. Consultation has been going on for at least the past two years with local government bodies in Northern Ireland with regard to changes. Those bodies are particularly disappointed that the outcome is more or less in line with the original suggestion by a previous Secretary of State with regard to the number of councils that would be established, namely, there is to be a reduction from 26 to seven councils, which is at the lower end of what was expected. Most of those involved in local government were hoping that there would be at least ten to 12 councils, a number to which I would subscribe. There is need for a greater number of councils to ensure full participation.I support the call by Senator O'Toole on Garda involvement in tackling crime. What he said in regard to Limerick was absolutely correct in that tremendous progress has been made recently. I would like the House to discuss change, particularly with regard to the offence of being a member of a criminal gang, which has proved difficult to define precisely. We recently saw serious Irish criminals brought to heel in Belgium, where that offence was one of the charges levied at them. As legislators, we need to consider this area in order to assist gardaí in tackling serious crime.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I am shocked to discover that obesity and related illnesses killed up to 2,500 Irish people last year. This society is not doing enough to ensure this illness is cured and the Government allocated a paltry €3 million to tackling it. The House should debate the issue because it needs to be addressed. Many young people are dying needlessly because not enough attention is paid to this area.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I too support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland, particularly in regard to the local government proposals. I generally support Senator Ó Murchú's point that the proposals are too functional and miss out on essential democracy. The process was begun by the former Executive — I believe it did so in an exercise in self-preservation, but that is by the way — and has been discussed for a number of years.What is now at issue is not the fact of change but the number of local authorities. As Senator Walsh stated, to have between 12 and 15 councils would be about right. Otherwise, we run the danger of the Balkanisation of Northern Ireland and virtual repartitioning on sectarian lines. The next step would be the demand for separate police forces on those lines. What began as a non-political exercise has become highly charged with politics and the wrong decisions have been made.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I support the call to invite the Minister for Transport to the House to debate the condition of the school bus fleet, particularly in rural areas. Much is expected of the system but many of the buses operating throughout rural Ireland are in a very poor condition. A child recently told me that pupils travel to school each morning in bone-shakers. Some pupils must leave their homes at 7 a.m. to catch school buses. It is important that this issue be debated and that we would bring the school bus fleet to an acceptable standard. The system is fairly satisfactory in cities and major towns but rural areas seem to be neglected.I support my colleague, Senator Feighan, with regard to his call for a debate on obesity. Across Europe, more than 300,000 children are overweight or suffering from obesity and this figure is rising by approximately 10,000 per year. Serious health problems will result if the problem is not addressed. A debate in the House is warranted.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The Director of Public Prosecutions published a report this week which is worthy of consideration for a debate in the House. The report suggests that one third of Garda cases fail to reach the courts due to a lack of evidence and that only two out of every five cases reach the courts. I do not know the reason for this outcome but, in business, if ten products were produced but only three succeeded in getting to the market, it would be considered very inefficient. The report of the DPP is worthy of consideration for debate.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland, particularly in regard to local government. However, I caution that we should first have a debate on local government in this State, particularly with regard to better local government and customer-friendly services. The Government has imposed an embargo on 860 local government posts and the quality of service has been affected as a result. In Tipperary north, for example, planners cannot be appointed permanently and this is leading to an inconsistency in service. The frustration being experienced by the public as regards local government needs to be addressed urgently. For example, I recently waited on hold for 31 minutes on a telephone to the strains of "Have I told you lately that I love you?" If that is the quality of service that better local government can offer in the Republic of Ireland, then I would forewarn the people in Northern Ireland. This matter needs to be addressed. Employees in local government are being offered temporary contracts. That means good people move on after a short period of time. This needs to be addressed. In Tipperary north there are more planners than tourists.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I hope the House is aware that a large head of steam is building up on both sides of the Atlantic, and has been prominent in the media in the past few days, concerning the activities of multinationals in this country and the tax rate they enjoy. It appears, because of what is happening in the United States, and here as well, that there is danger in the undergrowth of some fundamental change in the treatment of multinationals, not necessarily in Ireland, but in the United States.A presidential commission is looking at their taxation regimes and what is known as transfer pricing, which is their means of not repatriating money back to America. There have been a number of high profile cases involving at least one person, I will not name him, taking large sums of money through a perfectly legitimate tax loophole. The problem is that Ireland may be looked upon by the United States as a tax haven, and is being referred to as such in the Wall Street Journal.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Has the Senator a question?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	32	There will be calls on this side of the Atlantic for the 12.5% corporation tax to be raised. The House should be alerted to the fact that extremely important implications are involved for the economy in the event of any change in the rules applying to multinationals and we should hold a debate on the matter. People should be warned that this is one of the most important parts of the economy. The Government should be aware of that and should take the necessary measures to protect us from any attack on that tax break.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Within the next few weeks I understand the redress board will stop taking applications from people entitled to compensation for abuse suffered in various institutions. One of the points made very strongly to us by a number of people all over the country is the restriction on applying to the board being experienced by many of the people who were resident in Magdalen laundries. On the basis of correspondence I received from the Minister, the Department has decided that the laundries were different from some of the institutions covered by the Act, in that some of the people who worked in them did not come directly from institutions. They might have been over 16 years of age when they were placed in laundries and, therefore, the State does not have responsibility for them.However, I ask that this whole issue be debated by the House as a matter of urgency. People who watched the various programmes over the past few years, on the Magdalen laundries in particular, would be horrified to know that some, if not most, of the victims of abuse in those institutions were not eligible for compensation from the Residential Institutions Redress Board because of the way the Act is written.The State has a responsibility to these unfortunate people. If the Act needs to be looked at again, to be broadened or a new compensation system has to be put in place, that should be done. There is a moral obligation to try to include the maximum number of victims. All of these people suffered horrendously, through no fault of their own. It is dreadfully unfair if the redress board is not empowered to assist and compensate them.

I support the call for a debate on this issue.As regards education, there are three or four other issues that are current. One of these is the drive by some elements of the media for league tables. That might have been discussed yesterday or last week. However, given the agenda apparently being driven by certain elements of the media and others, it would do no harm to include this in a composite debate on education, perhaps identifying up to five of the serious current issues. I support Senator Bradford's call for a debate.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I join with the Cathaoirleach in extending a welcome to our Swiss colleagues who are here today.Senators Brian Hayes, Ryan, Ó Murchú, Walsh, Maurice Hayes and Coonan raised the matter of Northern Ireland. I still believe we should have a debate on the wider aspects of the whole situation, particularly with regard to the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive.I take the point that has been made as regards the councils and note it is proposed to reduce the number from 27 to seven. Even if Northern Ireland is overgoverned, as has been asserted, that appears to be a draconian reduction. It is primarily an internal matter, of course, but I echo the point made by several speakers to the effect that the system of local government that operates in Northern Ireland contributed significantly to cross-community understanding and was part of the impetus within the peace process. From that viewpoint they had an important role to play and it is one that should be borne in mind. We will see whether a debate may be arranged to discuss this and the wider implications at an early date.Senators Brian Hayes and Bannon spoke about school transport. Senator Hayes referred to the Navan bus crash. I understand the Director of Public Prosecutions is to bring a prosecution, so it is not appropriate to comment on that particular aspect of the case. However, I take the point made by the Senator. In any situation of this nature the families should be the first people to receive the report. I am sure the Government and the Minister will be mindful of that fact.I support the points made by Senator O'Toole as regards the Garda in Limerick and join in his congratulations on the work it is doing. As regards alternative energy, an opportunity exists for sugar beet and other crops to be used. As time goes on and fossil fuels become scarce and prices go up, the economics of this issue will increasingly come into focus. The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is looking at this matter, together with wind and other forms of energy. While the tax incentives are being reviewed, fairly critically and correctly in some cases, they all have a role in promoting issues of this nature. Tax incentives have a role to play because as matters stand, some of these initiatives can operate on a negative energy balance. It costs as much in energy to produce them as what emanates from them.As regards Senator Ryan's comments on the suspension of party members, I will bring them to the attention of the former Member of the Oireachtas, Desmond O'Malley, who has some personal experience of this matter.

Senator Kenneally raised the matter of oncology. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has always been amenable to discussing her brief in the Seanad. I am sure she will do so again, if requested, and we shall see if this can be done.As regards the report on the Shell pipeline raised by Senator Finucane, I note it was prepared by the Centre for Public Inquiry. The author of the report was one of the unsuccessful applicants for the Government report. With regard to contacts that were made with An Bord Pleanála and so on, it was a major national project that was subject to exhaustive public consultation and to the proper regulatory process.I echo what Senator Kenneally said about the policing of fisheries. There is a disproportionate concentration on the smaller, more vulnerable fishermen and perhaps not enough on those who are doing the most damage. The Senator makes a reasonable point about policing being proportionate and his comments should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.There will be two hours to debate the motion on Iraq, the use of white phosphorous and so on. It is standard practice for an amendment to be put down in the name of the Leader of the House. I will be supporting the amendment.Senator Walsh spoke about criminal gangs. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made the point that it may be difficult to secure convictions in this area, but the measures being brought forward by the Minister are needed and they respond to many calls made in this House to deal with these matters. We look forward to debating that legislation when it comes before the House.Senator Feighan made a good point regarding obesity. It is particularly a problem with children. There are on-going campaigns on this issue, one of which was prominent in yesterday's newspapers. Senators Feighan and Bannon referred to this issue and there is more progress to be made in this area.Senator Quinn referred to the report of the Director of Public Prosecutions which stated that one third of cases do not reach the courts. It could be interpreted that gardaí are attentive in bringing forward the evidence they have and it is up to the DPP to make an independent assessment. It could be said that the gardaí are doing their job properly, but that if there is not enough evidence, the DPP must make a decision on whether the case should proceed or not.Senator Coonan spoke about local government in this State and the planners that work in them. I sympathise with his complaint about the service the local authorities provide because we have all had the experience of being put on hold when calling their offices, only then getting through to voicemail. It is just as well he did not have to listen to "Puppet on a string" when he was on hold. We have had many debates on local government and perhaps we should have another one in the near future.Senator Ross spoke about multinationals. That matter can be examined tomorrow when there is a debate on the Estimates. It is a matter of national sovereignty for us to determine our own tax rates, which has been institutionalised in the various European treaties that we signed.I have much sympathy with what Senator Bradford said about the Residential Institutions Redress Board. I know that some institutions have been excluded, including the Magdalen laundries. Senator Fitzgerald raised the matter of the orthopaedic hospital in Clontarf. I am not sure what we can do about that, but I will bring it to the attention of the relevant Minister. Whether institutions are within the scope of the scheme or not, people who have been badly dealt with by the State should have some form of redress. Senator Fitzgerald also spoke about education.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 26, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:"(3) The Minister shall supply to one or both Houses of the Oireachtas such information regarding the performance of the Commission's functions as may from time to time be required by a Member of either House.".I am disappointed the Minister of State has not agreed to this amendment. It would make the new commission accountable to Members of the Oireachtas, unlike the existing situation in respect of the Health Service Executive and the National Roads Authority, whereby a Minister can pass the day-to-day operations over to them. Members have seen how Deputies cannot get replies to their Dáil questions and how Senators cannot raise an Adjournment matter in this House, in which their queries are answered by the relevant Minister. Matters are instead passed over to the National Roads Authority or Health Service Executive.The Minister of State should accept this amendment so that Members of both Houses would have accountability, whether it be through a question tabled in the Dáil or through an Adjournment matter in this House, so that their questions would be answered on the floors of the Houses. This should be done as all Members of both Houses agree that the existing situation in respect of the Health Service Executive and the National Roads Authority is unsatisfactory.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I second the amendment. To a large extent, I remind the Minister of State that the work which is carried out by both Houses of the Oireachtas is not always recognised outside. Senator Paddy Burke has referred to the National Roads Authority and other cases. One of our objectives is to ensure that the work of the Oireachtas is recognised. This amendment would not establish a precedent. I support it and believe it would be useful. The Minister of State should reconsider his decision not to accept it.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I thank Senator Paddy Burke for raising this issue. I responded to it when he raised it on Committee Stage. I also thank Senator Quinn for endorsing Senator Burke's comments in this regard. While I agree with the sentiments expressed, the issue goes beyond this Bill. If one considers the workings of the Houses to which Senator Quinn has alluded, one should acknowledge the developments of recent years, whereby autonomous authorities have been established. I presume that if Members agree that this is the correct way to proceed, we do not wish to hamstring them. We do not wish to pull them back by stating that while providing such bodies with their own autonomous authority is the correct course of action, we also want to be in a position to question their day to day activities through the relevant Minister.On Committee Stage, I explained there is a system in place with regard to the functions and day to day responsibilities remaining with the chief executive of whatever the authority may be. In this instance, I do not wish to continue to refer to the commission. The relevant Oireachtas joint committee is responsible and has the opportunity to challenge the chief executive. While all Members are probably still becoming familiar with those procedures, they are in place.I agree that a genuine issue exists and that Members are still learning how to deal with the new systems, including the Oireachtas joint committees. However, if Members are dissatisfied with the ways in which they operate, it is probably incorrect to challenge them in this Bill. When this matter was raised on Committee Stage, I suggested to Senator Paddy Burke that it be raised with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. If this was solely an issue in respect of the operation of the commission, I would take it on board.However, as Senator Quinn noted, the issue arises periodically in respect of the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas. If that is the case, this is a wider issue concerning previous precedents. As the Bill will establish another commission, should we separate the Houses from its day to day operations? If that is the Members' point, I believe this is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It is the best forum in which to respond adequately to Members' genuine concerns.This Bill simply proceeds with what is considered to be established practice. I acknowledge the Senators' concerns and that clarity may be required regarding the actual responsibility of the Minister of the day to come before the House, given that his or her sole area of responsibility would be in respect of policy. I hope my officials will correct me if I am mistaken. The functions and day to day operations of an authority — in this instance we refer to the commission — would be a matter for its chief executive. At present, the Oireachtas joint committees, which consist of Members of both Houses, have responsibility in this regard. They are established on that basis so that all Members may inquire of, assist and question the chief executive.I hope this is helpful. I could tell the Senators that I would accept this amendment, that it would resolve all the known issues and would change everything, thereby setting a precedent. However, that is not the proper way to go about our business. I say this in order to be helpful to the Senators, whose intentions are genuine. Therefore, I suggest to them that they should consider withdrawing the amendment to pursue the issue through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I would be happy to take up the matter with the Chief Whip.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	47	This resembles a legal battle whereby one can have one group of lawyers saying one thing while another group says the opposite. Time after time however, as far as the Health Service Executive and the National Roads Authority are concerned, we have seen how Members of either House table questions or move Adjournment matter, only to have their questions or motions ruled out of order on the grounds of Ministers' lack of responsibility in the area. We could set a precedent with this Bill by accepting my proposed amendment. Consequently, there would be accountability and questions could not be ruled out on the grounds of lack of responsibility.While I take the Minister of State's point in respect of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, it is unable to change the operation of any Act that has been passed pertaining to, for example, the Health Service Executive or the National Roads Authority. However, Members can do something about this Bill by accepting this amendment, which would provide accountability to Members of both Houses. While it may never be used in this case, at least it would be provided for. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this matter and to take it on board, because it is a reasonable amendment which would provide accountability to both Houses of the Oireachtas.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Senator Burke has hammered home a point pertaining to an issue that I acknowledge and recognise. Senator Quinn has seconded the amendment. I admire Senator Quinn, who has a similar working style to mine. I like to have, and understand, structures and to keep them working in the manner in which they were established. Through the political system new structures and authorities, such as the Health Service Executive mentioned by Senator Burke, have been established to deal with a specific function. The Senator also mentioned the National Roads Authority, which was established to deal with a single task to delivering a road programme for Ireland. With these authorities in place does one retain the Minister with a view to his or her responding to issues in the House? While we have established the HSE, do we expect the Minister to second guess and alter the executive's strategies?It took a long time to establish structures and achieve agreement between the political groupings on the need to establish the HSE and other authorities. Some of these authorities have proven themselves; they are not hamstrung by procedures but are able to go forward and deliver the results for which they were established. However, they are duty bound to respond to issues via the joint Oireachtas committees. That is the system we have established.If I agree to this amendment, does Senator Burke honestly believe it will deal with the issues he has raised regarding the HSE and the NRA? It will not. If we are genuine about wanting to make a change I can ask my officials what we can do to note this rather than withdraw it. I do not know how that will impact on Report Stage.I am anxious to respond as positively as I can in a helpful way to resolve the issue. This is not the appropriate format; the appropriate format is the CPP. I hope that is helpful. If this issue is pushed to a vote, it is clear what the result would be, and I am not sure what that would do for the objective behind the amendment. If we are genuine about that objective I would like to assist. I would be happy to talk to the Government Whip. Rather than withdraw the amendment or vote on it with an unwanted result I am open to accommodating whatever we need to accommodate to record the issues discussed here.

Section 54 of the Bill gives an undertaking on the reporting of risks by railway staff and contractors. I draw the Senator's attention to sections 54(1)(a) and (b), and sections 54(2) and (3). If there is anything not covered by those sections I ask Senator Burke to bring it to my attention and I will be happy to amend any aspect of it. These sections cover what Senator Burke’s amendment is trying to achieve so it is not necessary to proceed with it.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 55, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:"(b) requirements for the maintenance and inspection of railway infrastructure, rail track, permanent way and rolling stock,(c) the maximum carrying capacity for both passenger and freight trains,(d) the maximum hours of work and the minimum hours of rest for safety critical staff,”.This amendment deals with the carrying capacity of trains, the maximum and minimum number of hours worked and maintenance of the rail track. We spoke in detail on this on Committee Stage and I raised it on Second Stage. I would like to hear the Minister of State's views.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I thank Senator Burke. We had a similar amendment on Committee Stage. I am happy to clarify the record again in relation to paragraph (b). To tell railway undertakings how often they should inspect and maintain their infrastructure and trains would be a prescriptive approach. I asked whether we should ensure the relevant professionals, who have the duty of responsibility, make those decisions rather than telling them when to perform inspections.The Bill adopts the prescriptive approach only in the most extreme circumstances. The Bill places the primary duty of care on the railway undertakings, where it belongs. In a safety case, a railway undertaking is required to demonstrate to the commission that its inspection and maintenance regimes are appropriate to the condition of its infrastructure and trains.On paragraph (c) of this amendment, section 69(c) of the Bill empowers the commission to make regulations restricting the number of standing passengers allowed to travel on a train. The seating capacity is clear. I referred to this on Committee Stage. The capacity of freight trains is a factor of the rolling stock in question. Under section 43, new rolling stock must be approved by the commission and the fitness for purpose of all rolling stock used by a railway undertaking must be demonstrated to the commission as part of the safety case process. Capacity of freight trains will be considered in that contextRegarding paragraph (d) of the amendment, I would expect a railway undertaking to be able to demonstrate in a safety case that the working patterns of its safety-critical staff did not contribute to an increase in risk on the railway. That is an important point, and I thank the Senator. I ask him to examine the section dealing with it. Senators will also be aware that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, last year made SI 817 of 2004, which extended the maximum 48-hour working week to transport workers in line with the amended EU working time directive.Senator Paddy Burke asked me to repeat some of what I said on Committee Stage, but I hope that those clarifications adequately respond to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) in amendment No. 6.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I move amendment No. 7:

Has he done so?
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I second the amendment.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I have examined the amendment. Section 23 of the Transport Act 1971 makes provision regarding the apportionment of costs of upgrading works at a level crossing between the railway undertaking and the local authority, and section 113 of this Bill makes provision regarding the responsibility of any person carrying out works on a public road near a railway. That covers subparagraph (i) of the amendment.Regarding subparagraph (ii), section 113(4) provides the commission with powers to prepare and publish guidelines on works on public roads that may affect the safety of railway infrastructure. Consultants are currently preparing those guidelines to be ready for adoption by the commission on its establishment. I regret that they are not available today, but I will ask departmental officials to forward them to Senator Paddy Burke when they have been sent to the commission and adopted by it. While they will be guidelines, they will address risk imported onto railways from a third party, and I seek the Senator's comments on that.Regarding subparagraph (iii), section 69(g) provides the commission with power to make regulations in respect of the reporting of different classes of railway incidents. That would include incidents of vehicles causing a hazard by obstructing railway infrastructure. Section 18 makes it an offence to do so in any form or fashion, whether with a vehicle or otherwise. My Committee Stage amendment No. 36, inserted a new section into the Bill relating to the reporting of such accidental hazards blocking railway infrastructure. In the light of such clarifications, I would welcome the Senator’s comments on the need for his amendment.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	61	In view of the guidelines which the Minister of State has said he will forward to us, I will withdraw the amendment.

In page 63, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:"(7) A railway undertaking shall not use commercial considerations as a cause for not complying with section 36.”.The Minister of State should take this amendment on board, particularly in light of the fact that the entire infrastructure of the railway could be opened up for commercial purposes. We have seen that Iarnród Éireann does not want any responsibility, good, bad or indifferent, regarding commercial freight. The Minister of State should accept the amendment, since many people in the country would like to see lorries taken off the roads so that we can return to commercial freight. That would be a step forward.In view of the fact that there are several companies, particularly from Europe, which would tender for rail freight, the Minister of State should consider this area. When some of those companies approach the Department of Transport, they are told to go to Iarnród Éireann, which has no interest in rail freight. If Iarnród Éireann is not interested, the Department should make a decision itself. The Minister should take this amendment on board.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I second the amendment. I fully support it, having worked with a company that could rely on trains coming into Waterford from Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Belfast as part of freight run by Iarnród Éireann. Now practically all that freight goes on the roads, an appalling state of affairs. Iarnród Éireann should be prepared to market rail freight aggressively. It is disgraceful to see so many trucks on the roads when so much could be carried more safely on the railways. I fully support the amendment.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I draw the House's attention to two amendments on Dáil Report Stage, in response to concerns raised on Committee Stage, to address the issue of balance between commercial and safety considerations. Those amendments led to the present text of sections 77(5) and 78(6), which require that a court take account of the duty of care placed on a railway undertaking under section 36.We should acknowledge that we have quite a good safety record. Railways and other industries have developed well-established techniques for assessing what is a tolerable level of risk in accordance with societal expectations. The balance struck is that the risk must be maintained at as low a level as reasonably practicable, the internationally accepted norm.Perhaps I might respond to Senator Paddy Burke regarding the points raised. Section 36 places a duty on the railway undertaking to ensure the safety of persons in the operation of its railway as far as is reasonably practicable. Ultimately, it will be a matter for a judge or jury to decide what it is reasonable to expect a railway undertaking to do in a practical circumstance to ensure safety.Unfortunately, no one can give an absolute guarantee of safety in anything that we do. As a society, we daily decide what constitutes a reasonable risk. We accept that some risk is inevitable in life, and there tends to be wide consciousness of what level is intolerable. A judge and jury are the ultimate arbiters of what we as a society consider an acceptable risk. One could say that section 36 requires a railway undertaking to manage risk in accordance with societal expectations. We must try to ensure that we are satisfied. It is a matter for this House to decide whether the Bill strikes the right balance in what is deemed to be the most reasonable approach to the issue. I hope the points I raised in respect of sections 6, 36, 77 and 78, and section 5 in particular, are somewhat helpful to the House.

Amendment No. 13 proposes to simplify the text of the new section I introduced in amendment No. 48 on Committee Stage by removing the distinction between road and rail bridges. This issue was discussed in the House. The offence and reporting requirements regarding bridge strikes by heavy goods vehicles are the same whether the bridge is a road bridge or rail bridge.Amendment No. 14 is a drafting amendment adding two new subsections. The new subsection (6) revokes Article 34 of the 1997 regulations, which makes it an offence for a driver to pass a regulatory height restriction sign if his or her vehicle exceeds the specified height. I am advised it is not appropriate in law to have two offences with different penalties relating to the same issue and therefore the revocation of Article 34 in this Bill will avoid the need to amend the regulations. The new subsection (7) is consequent on the revocation of Article 34.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I thank the Minister of State for introducing those amendments, particularly amendment No. 13. We discussed the new subsection that was introduced to the legislation on Committee Stage. Over the years, much buck passing took place between local authorities and Iarnród Éireann and there were areas of responsibility regarding which nobody would make up his or her mind. If a local authority wanted to get something done, it was deemed to be the responsibility of Iarnród Éireann, and vice versa. We saw much toing and froing and I am therefore glad the Minister of State has clarified the matter. I welcome amendment No. 13.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I thank the Cathaoirleach, his support staff and the Members of the House who have contributed to this debate, which has assisted in making the Railway Safety Bill 2001 even better. In particular, I thank Senators Quinn, Cummins and Paddy Burke, and my colleagues Senators Wilson and Dooley, for their contributions on the various Stages of the Bill.The House will acknowledge that the legislation is substantial, technical, complex and very necessary. It updates the law on railway safety, which is Victorian and no longer appropriate to the railway safety systems of today. Although I have already outlined the history of this legislation on the public record, I will do so again. The Leader of this House, Senator O'Rourke, published and introduced it in 2001. Its two principal features are the creation of the independent railway safety regulator, the railway safety commission, and the appointment of an independent railway accident investigator.Senators will be aware of the ongoing debate on random breath testing for drink driving. However, this Bill is innovative in that it provides for random testing of safety-critical workers for intoxicants and makes it a criminal offence to be intoxicated while working on the railway. The intoxicants provisions of the Bill were carefully drafted and the Office of the Attorney General has confirmed the constitutionality of the provisions. This is important in light of the particular issues being raised in the debate regarding the proposals for the introduction of random testing under the road traffic legislation.I have already advised the House of the significant investment programme the Government has undertaken to ensure all risk to staff and customers across the railway network is maintained as low as is reasonably practical. This issue was raised by both Senators Paddy Burke and Cummins.Before I came to this House this morning, I met representatives of Iarnród Éireann regarding another issue. They were quite surprised when I mentioned that our investment in railway safety, beginning in 1999, will have exceeded €1.4 billion by 2013. This is a substantial sum and is not always invested where its effects are visible. In this regard, most Members want to ensure the public is aware of our work and level of investment in safety. The investment in safety is not visible but Members will fully appreciate that it is vital to ensure our railway infrastructure is as safe as we desire.I acknowledge that the Leader of this House, who was Minister for Public Enterprise in 1999, was responsible for securing what was in 1999 a substantial initial sum, to be invested in railway safety. It might have been much easier for her to invest the money in more visible developments in our railway system but she made the correct choice because our infrastructure is now such that it can benefit from our investment in our systems, including the €34.4 billion under the Transport 21 package. We would not be able to do this unless we were satisfied that the first step, that is, ensuring safety, was taken adequately.I pay tribute to and congratulate the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, on the correct procedures she initiated in 1999 and on which she followed through until 2001, when the Bill was published. Many of the provisions of this Bill implement the requirements of the EU railway safety directive adopted in April 2004. This ensures that we meet our EU obligations in that the directive will be transposed within the required timeframe. Other more technical requirements of the directive will be transposed through regulations to be made under this Bill.I emphasise again that the new regulatory framework outlined in this Bill, together with the major investment the Government continues to make in our railways, will provide assurance to the travelling public that safety is and will continue to be of paramount importance to the Government. I thank Senators, particularly my colleagues Senators Dooley and Wilson, for teasing out many aspects of this Bill with me prior to my introducing it in the House. I also thank Senators Quinn, Cummins and Paddy Burke for their constructive contributions and the relevant chastisement they gave me, quite correctly, on some issues.It is important that I refer to an issue raised by Senator Burke and Senator Quinn with regard to the reporting structure of the commission and what is currently in place. I have given the Senators an undertaking in that regard. If they are not satisfied with the feedback they receive from the Department through my office and through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I invite them to table an appropriate amendment to the Bill to ensure progress in satisfying the needs of our representatives on the CPP. If that must be done with one Bill to set the precedent to ensure it applies to the other areas, so be it.However, I was a little reluctant to accept it in respect of this Bill because we went on to discuss other issues. I had some experience with the changes that occurred in the health services when the eastern region was changed from a health board to a regional authority with area boards and the relevant reporting structures. It was difficult to get a grip on what was happening with regard to who dealt with policy, who dealt with service, who reported what structure to where and how the reporting structures operated. It took time to become familiar with it.If there is continuing concern that we are losing a role with regard to accountability to this House when we establish a commission, as in this instance, or a services executive or a road authority and if there is dissatisfaction with the existing Oireachtas committee system in that regard, I will be favourably disposed to establishing a precedent that would require the necessary changes in other legislation to accommodate those concerns. However, it should be done through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because that structure already exists. I take it that Members are satisfied with the CPP structure.I will ask my departmental officials to prepare the required report for the CPP and if there is no appropriate progress, it might be a matter for the Oireachtas committee to make the required changes. However, let us tease this out and see what we can do. If the precedent must be established with the railway commission, I will take a positive approach to making the required change.The Bill dates from 2001 but this is 2005 so I hope there will be quicker progress with it. The Bill will ensure continued safety on the railway network for passengers and staff. I wish to record my appreciation of my departmental staff, who are with me today. They are Mairead Broderick, Damien Clark, Priscilla Robinson and Maurice Treacy.

She said on Second Stage that this is her Bill so I compliment Senator O'Rourke on her input into it and on bringing rail safety to its current standard.I thank the Minister of State and his officials and Members of the House for a good debate on rail safety. I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill. I accept his comments regarding the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the suggestion that we table amendments if we are unhappy with the situation.I thank the Minister of State for his comments. I was in Prague last weekend with members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and it is clear that we have a long way to go in spending on public transport. Prague has an unbelievable system that fully integrates railway, metro, trams and buses. Even if €34 billion were spent here in the next two or three years, there would still be a long way to go to catch up with that city, which has a similar population to Dublin. It clearly shows that we are very backward with regard to public transport.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I congratulate the Minister and his officials on this legislation. I appreciate the Minister's responsive attitude to the comments and suggestions that were made and his grasp of the detail of this Bill.A friend of mine was killed over 20 years ago in the Buttevant train crash. He travelled by rail to Cork because he thought he would be safer on the train than on the road. It is when one has such a personal contact with the issue that one is reminded of the responsibility we have in this matter. I congratulate the Minister.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I welcome the passage of the Bill and compliment the Minister of State and his officials for the constructive way they worked with us in discussing it. The Leader of the House is to be complimented on the work she did on the Bill. After the tremendous amount of work that went into the development of the infrastructure and the establishment of the safety commission, we are now on the verge of seeing great developments in the railway sector in Ireland. We have seen the introduction of the Luas and now there are the proposals in Transport 21, which encompass some existing proposals in terms of new rolling stock, the inter-city lines and more commuter services in and around Dublin. That plan, together with the re-opening of the western rail corridor, is excellent news. This generation will see a reinvigorated and well developed rail network which will benefit this and future generations. I compliment everybody involved.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	76	This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103 it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments. The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I have also circulated in the House the proposed grouping of amendments. Senators may contribute once on each grouping. I remind Senators that the only matter that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to the House.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	77	These amendments deal with changing the title "chiropody" to "podiatry" in the Bill. The sections amended are section 4, designated professions, section 26, the establishment of registration boards, and Schedule 3, qualifications required by existing practitioners. In line with the legal advice given by the Parliamentary Counsel, one title is protected for each profession under the primary legislation while provision is made for the protection of variance by regulation under section 95(3) of the Bill. It will be an offence for an unregistered practitioner to use a protected title or to falsely represent himself or herself as being a registered practitioner.As Senators will recall, there was considerable debate on Committee and Report Stages in this House and also within the chiropody and podiatry profession on the most appropriate title for that profession in the primary legislation — chiropodist or podiatrist. During the debate in this House, the title "chiropodist" was used in the Bill because that reflects the title by which the profession is currently better known to the public in this country.As Senators will be aware, however, varying views were held by the relevant professional bodies on this matter. Some groups expressed a preference for the title"podiatrist". While the relevant professional bodies had sought to include both titles in the primary legislation to deal with the issue, that would not have been consistent with the legal advice available and the approach taken in the Bill for other professions. Against that background, following the debate in this House the professional bodies agreed that if only one title is to be protected under the primary legislation, the preferred title is "podiatrist". Variance can be protected by regulation.There is an argument to be made for the use of either "chiropodist" or "podiatrist". One is a title currently more in use by the Irish public while the other reflects the title used in some other countries and in educational courses for the profession. On balance, and in light of the final view reached by the professional bodies in this matter, amendments were made to change the title in the Bill from "chiropodist" to "podiatrist". These amendments are largely technical in nature and provide for the change in title used, from "chiropodist" to "podiatrist", in section 4, which designates the professions for the purpose of the legislation, and in section 26, which provides for the establishment of a podiatrists registration board instead of a chiropodists registration board. The amendments also provide for the necessary consequential technical changes to Schedule 3 of the Bill.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I thank the Minister of State for explaining these amendments. If professional bodies agree that "podiatrist" is the term that should be used in the event of disagreement, we would support the amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	79	As the Minister of State can imagine, I am delighted with this amendment having spent a great deal of time arguing that "podiatrist" should be the terminology used in the Bill. I thank him very much for the change. The change is important because a degree in podiatry will be recognised; that is covered in Schedule 3. If we are to recognise a degree in podiatry we are obliged to have that description in the Bill. I am glad this sensible amendment is being made.A concern I have is that we do not yet have a school of podiatry in this country and, unfortunately, as the Minister of State will be aware from his professional background, we do not need one school but several because with people living longer and the huge increase in the incidence of diabetes, many more people badly need the care of podiatrists from a medical point of view. That is not just to keep them on their legs but to ensure they are not overtaken by complications of illness, which require them to be admitted to hospital in some cases, whereas if they had access to a qualified podiatrist on a regular basis, all would be well. The school of podiatry must be established as soon as possible.That is also important from the point of view of the establishment of the board to regulate podiatrists because a member of that board must be someone qualified in podiatry in this country. The fact that we do not have such a person is a complication. I suggested during the passage of the Bill through this House that we should take someone with a qualification from outside the country until a school of podiatry is established here. We need someone with experience to become a member of the board but that is not covered in the Bill. When replying, will the Minister of State explain how that will be dealt with? Will someone from an academic institution with a qualification in podiatry be available to go on the board or will it be someone who is working in a school of podiatry here? We may not be able to acquire someone like that for quite some time and I would not wish to see any delay in the setting up of the board for podiatrists.

She was not going to let it go; it was going to stay on the agenda. The amendment is most welcome. As Senator Maurice Hayes said, the professionals called for the change although as the Minister of State said, the general public will probably continue to call it chiropody. I thank the Minister of State for being most accommodating in terms of the amendments on all Stages and in getting help from his officials.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Regarding Senator Henry's comments about a school of podiatry, I understand consultations are already taking place on that matter with the Department of Education and Science. I hope we will be able to progress that matter.On Senator Henry's last question, the registration board can bring in outside expertise with appropriate qualifications. In cases where there are no suitably qualified persons, the provisions of subsections (5)(a) and (5)(b) of section 28 will apply. This provides a mechanism to get over those situations where the expertise is not available for a particular profession.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I ask the Minister of State to deal with the third group, which consists of amendments Nos. 5 to 14, inclusive.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	89	These amendments relate to section 9, which deals with membership of the health and social care professionals council. The council will have a pivotal role in the system of statutory registration established under the Bill. Its object is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence among registrants of the dedicated professions.The council will have responsibility for overseeing and co-ordinating the activities of the registration boards. It will also enforce standards of practice for registrants, including the code of professional conduct and ethics adopted by their registration board. Moreover, the council has responsibility for establishing committees of inquiry into complaints against registrants of the designated professions and making decisions relating to the imposition of disciplinary sanctions on registrants.When providing membership arrangements for the council, it is therefore essential to strike a balance between professional expertise, knowledge of the health service and the public interest, to ensure the council is in the best position to carry out its responsibilities.Amendment No. 7 provides for the inclusion of three people among the council membership who have such qualifications, interests and experience as in the opinion of the Minister will be of value to the council in performing its functions. This will ensure the council has a wide mix of members and a continued strong level of involvement by those representing the interests of the public. The number of members has not changed, nor has the overall balance of practitioners and lay members. Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are technical amendments consequent to amendment No. 7.Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 require the Minister to consult as appropriate in regard to council appointments. Amendment No. 14 provides that the chairperson of the council may be paid certain remuneration for performing the functions of his or her office as may be determined by the council with the approval of the Minister for Health and Children, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. This is an enabling provision in keeping with similar provisions in other legislation. Amendments Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive, are technical drafting amendments.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	90	These amendments seem reasonable. However, I again have concerns in regard to the situation of podiatrists. Section 9(3)(b)(iii) provides that one of the members of the council will be “representative of third level educational establishments involved in the education and training of persons with respect to the practice of the designated professions and is nominated by the Minister for Education and Science”. Will the Minister of State explain how we can get around this provision in regard to podiatry, given that there is no relevant third level institution? Must we wait until such is established? I am otherwise in agreement with the amendments.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	91	My question may be more relevant to the previous group of amendments. Section 4(2) provides that after consulting the council, "the Minister may, by regulation, designate for the purposes of his Act any health or social care profession not already designated under subsection (1)”. A profession not included in section 4(1), and therefore not “designated” under the provisions of this Bill, is that of the rehabilitation engineer. Given that a medical device directive has come from the EU and that such engineers are involved in the development and modification of these types of devices, it seems remiss that they will not be governed by the health and social care professionals council because they are not a recognised profession under this legislation. It is unacceptable that the EU should be setting standards for these people while they are excluded from this legislation and, thus, from the governance of the council.For occupational therapists and speech therapists working in rehabilitative situations, it is generally the rehabilitation engineer who is the prominent professional with overriding responsibility. Unlike the professionals working under his or her direction, however, the rehabilitation engineer is not governed by the council in his or her work. What is the timeframe envisaged in section 4(2) during which the Minister may designate other professions not included within section 4(1)? With advances in assistive and rehabilitative technology, rehabilitation engineers have a major role to play, particularly in the disability sector, and should be covered by the provisions of this Bill.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I support Senator Kett in highlighting the situation in which rehabilitation engineers find themselves. As the Senator rightly observed, this legislation provides no regulatory body for them. They are, however, the dominant player in terms of their dealings with some of the other disciplines accommodated in the Bill. If we do not examine this issue, patients may suffer in the long term because of a breakdown in communication. We might have highlighted this area at an earlier date if it had come to our attention but it is better late than never. This profession should be included and its interest noted on the council.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	93	On the issue raised by Senators Kett and Feeney in regard to rehabilitation engineers, I am not aware it has been raised in any discussions I have had on the Bill in either House. That does not matter, however, as the legislation can accommodate more professions than are currently included. It was agreed that only 12 professionals should be included because they were better organised than many other professions.As regards the timeframe for the inclusion of other professions, I am interested in those professions that are necessary to be registered and in cases where there can be agreement among the professions themselves. In the mental health area, for example, there is a major requirement for counsellors and psychotherapists. The reason they are not included in this Bill is that we cannot get agreement on basic criteria for registration, expertise, qualifications and competence. In all these areas, there must be a baseline agreement in regard to the competence of the profession. As I have told counsellors, psychotherapists and others, they should try to determine a baseline qualification. It may already be there. They may be prepared to work with us in respect of forming a registration board. Some but not all of these groups have registration bodies of their own.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I ask the Minister of State to deal with the amendments in grouping No. 4, amendments Nos. 15 to 17, inclusive, and No. 28 on the publication of by-laws.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	99	These amendments to sections 22 and 32 deal with the rules made by the health and social care professionals council and the by-laws made by registration boards. Amendment No. 15 corrects a typographical error. Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 28 provide for the laying of rules and by-laws before each House of the Oireachtas.Senators will recall that the Bill was extensively amended in the Seanad to strengthen and enhance the transparency of arrangements for the making of by-laws by registration boards and rules by the council. On Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann, Deputies sought amendments requiring by-laws and rules to be laid before the Houses. Amendment No. 16 provides for the health and social care professionals council to publish its rules and submit them to the Minister for laying before the Houses.Section 95 deals with the Minister's power to make regulations and amendment No. 17 provides that section 95, subsections (4) to (6), inclusive, apply with the necessary modifications to rules of the council submitted to the Minister in accordance with the section as if they were regulations made by the Minister.Section 32 provides for the publication and other requirements relating to draft and other by-laws made by registration boards. Amendment No. 28 amends this section to provide for registration boards to publish by-laws and submit them to the Minister for laying before each House. Sections 95(4) to 95(6) will apply with the necessary modifications to the by-laws of registration boards submitted to the Minister in accordance with the section as if they were regulations made by the Minister. These provisions will further enhance the transparency and credibility of the regulatory system.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I welcome the amendments as they clarify matters. I also welcome other groups approaching various Senators and the Minister of State in order to be placed on statutory registers. We needed to go ahead with the then best organised groups as we could otherwise be waiting to get everyone moving forward in an organised way.One matter the groups are not clear on is that the various registration boards, once they make everything transparent, have a good level of autonomy. Other Senators and I have received considerable amounts of correspondence from psychologists. I can tell by those nodding that they have received correspondence also. These psychologists believed that the qualification for psychology outlined in Schedule 3 was insufficient to be on their registers. I was assured in the House, as were we all, that these registration boards could increase the required qualifications. I would welcome the Minister of State's clarification of this matter for the benefit of those outside the House.I was sure that I was right on this issue but the psychologists believe that a recognised psychology degree or diploma attained with first or second class honours is not enough, which I can understand. They believe people should have specialist training in the different branches of psychology. On reading the Bill again, especially in light of the amendments, all that boards must do is be transparent in what they do and bring it before the Houses.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I agree with Senator Henry's comments. On examination of the areas of psychology at third level and first or second class honours degrees, people must do postgraduate studies in order to secure employment. No one will look at them when they come out of universities with primary degrees. We all spoke at length on Second Stage about the types of psychologists. Someone after six weeks of training can call himself or herself a psychologist. While what the Minister of State is saying is clear to me, we should perhaps send out a clearer message.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I welcome the amendments. As has been stated, they clarify matters. I agree with Senators Henry and Feeney regarding registration boards in that, according to the Bill, it is within their remit to amend and change their rules as necessary. The matter should be better clarified.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I will do my best to explain the situation. I understand where the psychologists are coming from and there is very little disagreement between us. This happens when one registers a profession in order to have the optimum standards. No one questions that psychologists have extremely high standards as they have both primary degrees with first or second class honours and postgraduate training. All of the psychologists working in the public sector have these standards but there are some psychologists who have degrees and no postgraduate experience, many of whom have been practising for years in the public sector. It would be impossible in initiating legislation in this House to discriminate between members of a profession working in the public and private sectors.There is a timeframe in this legislation as these arrangements will apply for a period of two years from the establishment of a register and include the provision that practitioners who hold a stated qualification and have been in practice at any time during a period of five years before the establishment of a register should be granted registration. A practitioner must also satisfy the registration board, which is the key issue, that he or she is a fit and proper person to engage in the practise of that profession.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Exactly.

I can understand fears on this issue but it had to be introduced for this reason. One cannot introduce legislation that would immediately discriminate against some excellent people working in the private sector. I do not suggest for one moment that the Psychological Society of Ireland wanted to do that, as I understand its fears, but we managed that issue in a way that does, and will, satisfy its requirements.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The subject of the amendments in grouping No. 5 is the registration board which is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 20 to 25, inclusive, 29 to 30, inclusive, 34 to 36, inclusive, and 45 to 47, inclusive.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	107	These issues relate to the registration board and sections, 27, 28, 33, 46, 52, 59. These amendments relate to the work of registration boards generally and also refer to issues concerning complaints against practitioners. The object of the registration board of a designated profession is to protect the public by fostering high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of that profession. Its functions include giving guidance to registrants concerning ethical conduct and giving them guidance and support concerning the practice of their profession. Guidance on continuing professional development is an important element overall in regard to professional competency.Senators will know that section 31(1)(h) already provides for the making of by-laws for registration boards relating to continuing professional development of registrants. Amendment No. 20, which amends section 27 on the object of functions and powers of registration boards, explicitly places continuing professional development appropriately within the functions of registration boards.Section 28 provides for membership of registration boards and amendments Nos. 21 to 25, inclusive, are technical drafting amendments to this section. Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 amend section 33 which provides for committees of a registration board. With the council's approval and in keeping with any council rules and registration board by-laws, a registration board may establish committees to perform any of its functions or exercise any of its powers that may be better or more conveniently performed by a committee that are assigned by the board to a committee. During the debate in this House, the Bill provided for the establishment of committees to perform functions or exercise powers of a registration board under Part 3 or Part 5 of the Bill. Part 3 deals with registration boards, while Part 5 deals with the approval and monitoring of education and training programmes.Amendment No. 29 extends the ability to establish a committee to perform functions of a registration board under Part 4 of the Bill, which deals with registration. This will be a useful facility for a registration board as it may be appropriate or valuable for a registration board to establish a committee to undertake the complex task of assessing national and non-national qualifications held by applicants for registration as attesting to the standard of proficiency required.Section 33(5) provided that the acts of a committee are subject to confirmation by the registration board, unless the board dispenses with the necessity for confirmation. Under amendment No. 30, a registration board will not be able to dispense with the necessity for confirmation of the acts of a committee performing the board's functions or exercising its powers under Part 4. I should point out that section 33 allows a board to appoint people who are not members of the board to a committee and also makes it clear that a registration board should have regard to the necessity of including as members of the committee an appropriate number of persons representative of the interest of the general public.Amendment No. 34 amends section 46 of the Bill which deals with the issue of access to registers. The maintenance of a comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date register of practitioners is a main function of each registration board and is clearly pivotal to the effective discharge of the role of each registration board. Registrants also have important responsibilities to keep the relevant registration board informed of any changes in their registration details. Section 46(1)(a) states that a registration board shall make its register available for inspection by members of the public at all reasonable times. Section 46(1)(b) provides that the register can be published by electronic means or otherwise which means that it is open to a registration board to publish its register via the Internet but it is not restricted to this means alone. Amendment No. 34 further strengthens this provision by requiring a registration board to publish its register by electronic means and not less than one other means.Turning to complaints issues, section 52 of the Bill deals with complaints about conduct or competence of registrants and amendment No. 35 places an obligation on the council to process complaints in a timely manner. Section 59 provides for powers and protection relating to witnesses and evidence in regard to complaints committees. It is an offence to fail to comply with a summons or to refuse to co-operate with a committee of inquiry. Section 59(7) specifies that a person found guilty of an offence under this section would be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €2,500. The amendment to increase the fine to not exceeding €3,000 brings the fine in line with the fine set out in section 80 of the Bill which deals with offences and which was itself amended by Seanad Éireann.Amendments Nos. 45 to 47, inclusive, relate to the arrangements for the term of office for registration boards as set out in Schedule 2 of the Bill. Amendment No. 46 is a standard provision in regard to the first board which mirrors the approach taken for the first members of the council and amendments Nos. 45 and 47 are consequential technical drafting amendments.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	108	These amendments are to be welcomed. I have some anxiety to ensure that the general public will be made very aware of which professions are on a statutory register. One will see advertisements for "registered osteopath" but what register is being referred to? We must ensure it is well known which people are on a statutory register. I am sure these osteopaths are perfectly fine people and are doing a very good job but it should be ensured that the general public knows which professions have registers. All too sadly, there have been grim cases where people have become involved from a medical point of view with people who are not subject to any rules or regulations. It is bad enough when professions are subject to rules and regulations but at least there is some form of redress when problems arise. It is important that the public are made aware of which professions are registered on a statutory basis.

The reason for the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004 was the protection of the public as well as to regulate the professions. The public is being protected by the provision of continuous professional development. At least the public will know these practitioners have bought in to continued professional development. This is essential to give that feel-good feeling to the general public.I am delighted to hear the Minister of State refer to the ability of the registration boards to establish their own committees. Now that they have been given the tools, I hope they will take this further and perhaps develop competence assurance committees or consider peer review. I acknowledge that a clinical audit would be further down the road but they are only a short step away. It could be suggested to them when they have settled in. This will bring better protection for the public. I am delighted they will be allowed draft in expertise from without as this will introduce fresh air and let out the stale air. There will be no progress if they spend the whole time talking to themselves. I welcome the amendments.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I welcome the amendments as they will improve the Bill. As has been stated, the protection of the public is of paramount important in this regard. I hope it will receive the publicity it deserves. I also hope it will also frighten the public away from these cowboys, who are at every crossroads claiming that they can cure cancer and various other ailments and who should be banished. It is important that the public knows who is registered and that there is a proper registration board in place for these professions. I welcome the proposed amendments.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	111	On some of the comments made by the three Senators, first, the publication of the various professions which have registers, and which have been dealt with in the Bill, will be done and I am sure the professions will let it be known. To allay Senator Henry's fears about the protected titles, once the Bill is enacted these titles are protected in law and a person will not be able to put on a plate that he or she is a registered physiotherapist or a registered speech and language therapist if the person is not on the register. There is no duplicity about which register is concerned. They cannot be alluding to a made-up register. This will get over that difficulty in so far as one can. As Senator Henry stated, we encounter problems from time to time within professions that are already registered. Admittedly, this occurs infrequently but that, I suppose, is human nature. I am not excusing or condoning it, but it will happen in all professions.Senator Feeney commented on continuous education, which has always been important and will become more important as time goes, for all professions. Unfortunately, in previous times once somebody qualified in a profession he or she was not obliged to continue education. There has been evidence in the past of professions not keeping abreast of up-to-date practice and, unfortunately, causing damage. I am sure that continuous education will be a criteria of the registration board. It is essential. We all know that now. In every profession, their qualifications are nearly out of date within five years of qualifying. It is imperative that they will continue education and I am sure the new boards will insist that it happens.

#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Section 38 provides for the granting of registration to applicants who comply with general requirements and who hold a qualification approved by the registration board of a designated profession as attesting to the standard of proficiency required for registration. It also provides for a registration board to take account of qualifications awarded in another EU member state and those awarded in states outside the EU.Amendment 31 arose from concern that section 38 as it stood did not encompass some circumstances. Section 38 encompassed nationals of EU member states who have been awarded qualifications in a EU member state but did not specifically encompass EU nationals who gained their qualifications outside the EU.While section 38 also took account of those who are not EU nationals and who gained their qualifications outside the EU, it did not specifically encompass people who are not EU nationals and who have been awarded qualifications in a EU member state. Amendment No. 31 therefore amends section 38(2), 38(3) and 38(4) to fully take into account qualifications approved by the registration board whether such qualifications are awarded in this country, in another European country or outside the EU. It also takes into account both EU nationals and non-EU nationals.In some cases a qualification held by an applicant for registration may be below the standard required for registration. It may, in other words, be a lesser qualification. However, the applicant may have undergone additional training or acquired experience which satisfies the registration board, following a test of competence that it may require the person to take, that he or she has the requisite standard of proficiency for registration. The amendment takes account of this.Amendment No. 32 is a technical amendment defining what is meant by a lesser qualification. Amendment No. 33 is also a technical amendment deleting a previous definition which is no longer required in the context of the substantive amendment to sections 38(2), 38(3) and 38(4).Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 amend section 31. Section 31 provides for the making of by-laws by the registration board of a designated profession with the approval of the council and in accordance with any guidelines issued by the council. Amendment No. 26 is a technical amendment required on foot of the changes to section 38. Amendment No. 27 broadens section 31(e), which provides for the making of by-laws relating to procedures for the assessing of qualifications awarded, or training or professional experience acquired outside the State. This broadening of the scope of section 31(e) will further serve to enhance the transparency and openness of the system of statutory registration.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	117	This House considered aspects of the issue regarding EU nationals who would get qualifications outside the European Union, but I am glad to see that we left something for the Dáil to do. These are important amendments.I wish to mention one of my disappointments with the Bill. I understand the way it was decided to protect just one name only for each profession and I want to return to that of physiotherapist and the problem arising with physiotherapist and physical therapist. While we are correctly bringing in these other EU qualifications, the Minister of State will be aware that the United Kingdom legislation protects physical therapist with physiotherapist. Therefore, there is some conflict in this section. There is protection for titles being given but at the same time there is no protection of physical therapists in Schedule 3 and earlier in the Bill.As the Minister of State will be aware, the chartered physiotherapists have stated for years that our legislation should protect the title "physical therapist" with "physiotherapist" because of the occasional confusion that can arise here on this issue and I am sorry that this has not happened. I fear we may run into trouble in these sections where the term "physical therapist" may be used to describe someone who we would call a physiotherapist and to acquire those qualifications.Apart from that, I welcome the changes the Minister of State has made here. In view of the fact that the Belfast Agreement stated that we should try to ensure that the various qualifications in all parts of the island are in line with each other, I regret the fact that in this instance we will provide for a situation where in Northern Ireland physical therapist and physiotherapist are protected and in the Republic of Ireland only physiotherapist will be protected. I was one of those enthusiastic about the fact that we, particularly in the medical area, should try to get as much agreement as possible within the legislation.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I echo the sentiments expressed of my colleague, Senator Henry. This took more debate than the area pertaining to podiatrists. We were all strong in our view that the title "physical therapist" should have been introduced just for the protection of physiotherapists. I understand Senator Henry's point, coming from a medical background as she does. One fears that people will visit a physical therapist thinking they are visiting a physiotherapist and not realise the difference.The Minister of State was very accommodating on this issue. He reconsidered it and tried to reach agreement between the Irish Association of Physical Therapists and the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists but there was no budging on the part of one of those bodies. I am sorry that body could not see its way to accommodating the issue.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I support what was said on Second and Committee Stages, on which I spoke. The Minister of State and his officials have done a great job with regard to the Bill and I know of his effort and enthusiasm to solve this problem. The problem left unsolved is a danger. Senator Henry referred to the fact that in other parts of the world the use of the term "physical therapist" is understood to be the same as "physiotherapist". Therefore, we must be particularly careful that customers and patients are not misled.I know the Minister of State's heart is in the right place and that he has done his best. While we have not yet found a solution, I urge the Minister of State and his team to ascertain whether it is possible to find a solution in the years ahead.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I thank the Senators who have raised this matter again. The question of the title "physical therapist" has consistently attracted attention during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. For the physiotherapy profession, the title protected under the Bill is "physiotherapist". However, the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists also wishes to have the title "physical therapist" protected for exclusive use by those professionals registered with the physiotherapists registration board established under the Bill. The society considers both titles to be interchangeable in an international context and believes there is a risk of confusion for the public if the title of physical therapist were not protected for use by physiotherapists. However, members of the Irish Association of Physical Therapists, who currently use the title in this country, have argued against such a protection and wish to retain the title for their own use.As Senators have remarked, this is clearly a complex issue to which much attention has been given. The Tánaiste is of the view that matters must be resolved in a timely way. The way forward is to deal with protection of titles issues by regulation, as provided for in the Bill. In line with the provisions of section 95(3), the Tánaiste intends to consult with the physiotherapists registration board, on its establishment, and any organisations she considers appropriate in regard to prescribing the title of "physical therapist" for use by registrants of the physiotherapy profession. She would expect to make an early decision on the matter.I understand the points made by Senators. It is not an easy issue. We were afraid competition problems would arise and that the Bill could lead to litigation, which no-one would want. The Tánaiste has considered the issue and feels this is the way forward.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Is that agreed? Agreed.

However, the Bill contains transitional arrangements for the registration of existing practitioners. This system of grandparenting applies to those persons who are engaged in the practice of any one of the 12 professions covered by the Bill at the time of the introduction of statutory registration and who wish to be included on the relevant register. A similar arrangement will be available for professions that may be included in the system of statutory registration in the future. Section 90 defines terms used which relate to grandparenting provisions for existing practitioners. These provisions are in turn set out in section 91.The qualifications required of current practitioners are set out in Schedule 3 of the Bill and are linked to provisions for grandparenting of existing practitioners under section 91. As these are largely Irish-based qualifications, provision needed to be made for practitioners holding corresponding qualifications awarded in other European Union member states. Amendment No. 38 therefore defines "corresponding qualification" while amendment number 39 defines "relevant measure" in line with a definition set out earlier in section 38.Section 91 requires that a registration board must grant registration to persons who have been engaged in the practice of the relevant health and social care profession at any time during the period of five years before the day the register for the particular profession is opened, provided that the person satisfies the board that he or she either holds a qualification prescribed in Schedule 3 of the Bill or successfully completes an assessment of professional competence, and also satisfies the board that he or she is a fit and proper person to engage in the practice of that profession.Amendment No. 43 amends section 95 which provides for the Minister's power to make regulations for the effective operation of the system of statutory registration. Section 95(3) provides that, after consulting with the relevant registration board, the Minister may, by regulation, prescribe one or more than one title that is a variant of the title specified under section 4(1) of the Bill. Amendment No. 43 provides that the Minister may also consult any organisations he or she considers appropriate and therefore widens the consultative process.With regard to the importance of the Irish language, amendments Nos. 1 and 4, inclusive, were made to ensure that the Irish language title of the health and social care professionals council was included as appropriate, a point I omitted earlier.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I am sure the Minister of State can understand the gratitude, not only of those present, offered to him and his officials on the introduction of the Bill as it has been sought for almost 20 years. It is well that it is such good legislation because it is extremely important. It is important that the members of the professions covered by the Bill ensure publicity is used to show that they are the ones with statutory registration.The working of the Bill will probably be quite simple. The matters which Senator Feeney brought forward, based on her experience on the Medical Council, are important. These include continuing education, which is of such importance nowadays, and competence assurance. As the Minister of State said, when people qualified years ago that was it, and no one had to do any more study.I will just ask him to do one thing further, namely, try to get something done about the medical practitioners Act, which has been sought for 20 years as well. I told the House recently that I was assured six years ago, at this time of the year, that the Bill would be ready before Christmas. My mistake was not to ask which Christmas.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I compliment the Minister of State and his officials for bringing forward this very important legislation. I also thank him on behalf of the Fine Gael spokesman, Senator Browne, who is unavoidably absent this morning. The legislation deserves considerable publicity because it is in the public interest that people know about registered practitioners.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I, too, thank the Minister of State. He has been very accommodating, making this a simple Bill for the House to put through. He listened at all times and went back to amend the Bill in some way. I am glad it is back with us and that the House is giving it the green light. As Senators Henry and Cummins have noted, it is wonderful legislation. It is great for the general public and good for the professions. Well done to the Minister of State and his hard-working officials.I wish to echo Senator Henry's words as regards the medical practitioners Bill. We are both like long-playing records or CDs. It is legislation that must be amended and updated for the protection of the public. It would be remiss of us to say it does not need to be done. I would dearly like to see it come before the House.

The Bill represents a major step forward, not alone for the professions, but more importantly, the public. The whole thrust of the Bill is to safeguard the public and ensure that quality health services are on offer from the various professions.I was not aware that it was fiche bliain ag fás, that it took 20 years. Perhaps the fact that it is 20 years in gestation is the reason it is so good. Again I thank all the Senators for their contributions. I will try to find out about the medical practitioners Bill and expedite it, because I understand its importance.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Seanad Éireann on the important subject of housing. Housing is as important to the modern dynamic Ireland of the 21st century as it was to our newly established State early in the last century, which was a situation of urban slums and rural deprivation. It was a big focus of public policy. Good quality housing is fundamental to our economic progress and is an important element of our national infrastructure. For all of these reasons and many more we must provide housing in Ireland that is of a quality and value fully comparable with the best in the developed world.In progressing Ireland's development since we took office in 1997, the Government has paid particular attention to housing. We have made remarkable progress and I want to give the House a brief outline of just some of our achievements. The supply of housing has been transformed since 1997. Last year almost 77,000 units were completed, which was double the level achieved in 1997. Our rate of house building, at 19 units per 1,000 of the population, is almost four times the western European average. Housing supply in the greater Dublin area, which averaged about 9,000 or 10,000 units per annum in the late 1990s, increased to almost 17,000 last year.We have introduced adjustments to our tax regime to assist the first time buyer and we have introduced a range of targeted schemes to assist those seeking affordable housing. We have increased investment in social and affordable housing. I do not mention these things to boast, but because I believe they are important national achievements in which the nation should take some pride. We have concentrated on improving quality as well as quantity. Major funding has been devoted to regenerating run-down estates. For example, Ballymun is among the largest regeneration projects underway in Europe. It is a remarkable achievement by the people of Ireland, redressing a wrong that was created in Ballymun all those years ago. These achievements did not just happen. Government actions have supported the strong increase in overall housing supply and increased construction employment. Current policies have built on good foundations. Housing policy has been always a central plank of Fianna Fáil policy. In recent years, these policies have done the business.Ireland has had rates of house building not seen anywhere else in Europe in recent years. Only in the immediate postwar years have such housing output levels been seen. To put the scale of activity into perspective, three out of every ten homes in Ireland have been built within the last ten years — nearly 500,000 units in all. Output in 2005 is likely to be broadly in line with 2004. Some of the Cassandra-like statements that it would fall away do not seem to be upheld by the available data. The exceptional rate of house building in Ireland has been facilitated by improvements made by this Government in the planning system and substantial investment in infrastructure in recent years. It has also been facilitated by councillors of all parties and none around the country who have the courage to zone sufficient land to build houses. Without those decisions, some of which are taken in the teeth of opposition, we could not build the homes of tomorrow. Increased output has brought greater stability to the housing market.The general consensus among commentators is that current prospects for stability in the housing market, with balanced sustainable growth, are very good. A strong housing market has a positive effect on the economy as a whole, not just through its contribution to GDP. There are now around 240,000 people working in the construction industry compared with 92,000 in April 1994. If my memory serves me correct, 20 years ago the figure was as low as 71,000. The house-building industry has made a considerable contribution to this growth.The residential construction component of total construction output grew from 51% in 1994 to 65% in 2004. The gross value of housing output was just over €18 billion last year, which is the equivalent to 14% of GNP. In 1994, housing output represented just 7% of GNP. These are not just blank statistics. Each of these houses represents a home. Each of these wage packets represents security and all that is positive for the people in the industry.In analysing the housing boom, the National Economic and Social Council commented that given the remarkable strength of demand, a significant increase in house prices was inevitable. Supply is the key to responding to this unprecedented demand. The Government has placed a strong focus on policies to boost supply. It is not often acknowledged that house price increases have moderated since annual house price inflation peaked at a phenomenal 48% in 1998. That figure was caused by a serious imbalance between supply and demand. By comparison, house prices rose in 2004 by about 11% over 2003. It is still a very high figure, but at least it is heading in the right direction.The Government has been particularly concerned to improve access to affordable housing and has promoted a range of schemes for low income households in recent years, such as the shared ownership scheme and the 1999 affordable housing scheme. More than 20,000 households have availed of these schemes since their inception. I expect that approximately 12,000 units in total will be delivered between 2005 and 2007.The affordable homes partnership should be mentioned. It was established recently by the Government and will focus initially on the greater Dublin area. Although the partnership was only established last August, it has already made significant progress. It operates under the stewardship of Mr. Des Geraghty and a dynamic board. The partnership has already placed public advertisements inviting expressions of interest from parties capable of providing and developing land mainly for affordable housing. It is also giving early attention to the potential for land swaps.One of the land swaps undertaken as a test earlier this year was the highly successful Harcourt Terrace pilot project. At the time, there was some extraordinarily unbalanced media comment about the concept of a land swap. However, that exercise has yielded 193 new homes ready for turnkey development. This is not a bad return for a land swap involving what was little more than a shed and less than a half acre of land. Undoubtedly, had we sold the land, taken the money and invested it in the normal way through the local authorities, we would not have seen 193 houses within a 12-month period. Everyone knows that is the case and that this was a good deal. We must now think outside the box as to how we might get better outcomes.These homes and other affordable homes are now marketed in a most innovative manner by South Dublin County Council. I compliment the council on the manner in which it has dealt with this issue and its property path office is something that should be copied by all local authorities. I ask Members who have particular influence or contacts with county councils to encourage them to investigate this.I want to discuss Part V. The NESC has suggested that Part V was "the single most important policy development in recent decades." This innovative piece of legislation will make a substantial contribution to the delivery of social and affordable housing output over the coming years. Part V requirements do not apply to all residential developments and the number of units delivered through Part V arrangements is dependent on the level and commencement of private sector residential development and, crucially, on the nature of the arrangements entered into. While it will take a number of years for Part V to fulfil its potential, its impact has begun to be felt. Already, by the end of June 2005, almost 1,300 housing units were acquired under Part V arrangements, more than 2,200 affordable units were in progress and a further 2,500 units were earmarked for acquisition. The transfer of 17 parcels of land and 169 partially or fully serviced sites has also been effected and more than €18 million has been received in payments in lieu under the withering levy. However, as Minister, I discourage local authorities from taking funding and prefer if they take the houses and move people into them.The Government remains committed to the delivery of strong social and affordable housing programmes, as evidenced by the record levels of funding it has committed to these measures. The total housing provision, Exchequer and non-Exchequer, in 2005 will be more than €2 billion. That sum is more than double the expenditure in 2000 and more than five times that of 1995. Such a rate of acceleration is astonishing, even given house price inflation. More than 13,000 households throughout Ireland will be assisted through various social and affordable housing measures in 2005. This compares with approximately 8,400 households in 1998.To further expand our response to housing needs, we have introduced the rental accommodation scheme. This is an additional housing option for households that are currently accommodated within the private rented sector. This option will make some strong inroads in the coming years.We also encourage and support local authorities in implementing programmes of works to improve the quality of existing local authority housing. All Members will share my view that this is extremely important. The central heating investment programme was introduced last year to deal with those local authority houses that do not have adequate heating systems. This programme is making a real difference to the quality of life for many people. We have put aside €30 million this year for the programme and I am anxious that local authorities will press ahead with the work. I am also anxious that they receive value for money because in one or two cases that have been brought to my attention, I was not happy with the standard of work. I have made this clear through comments in the media and will continue to so do because carrying out sub-standard work is a betrayal of those who need central heating, particularly as the State and the taxpayers have put funding in place.I am strongly committed to ensuring that resources set aside by the Government will help the maximum number of households. Local authorities have a key role in the delivery of this objective. Housing is, rightly, a local issue and local authorities must respond to the nature and extent of local need by devising and implementing appropriate programmes within the resources made available by the Government. Some authorities are more successful than others and I will examine ways and means to encourage those who are somewhat behind to improve their performance.To create a strong framework for delivery, we have required local authorities to put in place five-year action plans. We have also introduced capital envelopes for funding purposes. Hence, the old discontinuities within the system have been removed. Past excuses for failing to meet housing targets no longer apply. In that context, when one considers the figures on output, it is disappointing that some local authorities — usually the same poor performers — are underperforming. I again ask Members who have any influence with local authorities to encourage them to improve their performance.In conclusion, improving services requires both investment and ongoing reforms to ensure that resources are applied in a way that is efficient, effective and equitable. Some challenges for the future and issues requiring consideration have been raised by the NESC. Further responses to the NESC are under development and I propose to issue a new statement on housing policy soon that will set further directions for the medium term. In the meantime, we have made important advances in respect of the new initiatives announced in June, including the establishment of the affordable homes partnership.My focus as Minister will be to build on the achievements to date, to promote housing supply at levels required to meet demand, to supply record levels of affordable housing, to modernise and develop the private rented sector, to roll out a strong programme of investment in social housing and to improve service and performance. The Government has a strong record on housing and will not simply rest on its laurels. It will press ahead with existing and new programmes to provide the best housing responses to Ireland's dynamic economy and society. That is the challenge for my Department, its agencies and me in the period ahead. Most importantly, it is a challenge for all at local and central government level to put their backs to the wheel to make an extra effort to deliver good quality and more affordable housing and to create the kind of homes that a dynamic and wealth economy should. The Government is making available the resources to ensure that the sector, particularly the social sector, continues to develop. It is important that local authorities also play their part.

While most, if not all, local authorities have provided the infrastructure in such houses, a serious problem exists with the ESB, which is probably the councils' biggest supplier in terms of connecting cental heating and electricity. I ask the Minister to investigate this matter. It is a nationwide problem and local authorities have contacted me to try to get action. The ESB is not co-operating with local authorities to make the final connection in respect of central heating.I hope, in the interests of thousands of people on the housing waiting lists, to make my contribution in as positive a manner as possible. Members see at first hand the misery caused by the inadequate housing provision of this Government, with weekly clinics full of angry and frustrated people seeking help to get a roof over their heads. We all have an input in respect of the problems that have a significant impact on the quality of life of so many.My party and I have not been silent on this issue in the past and have tried, as much as possible, to offer an alternative agenda and a workable plan that would help people in difficulty under the current circumstances, which have worsened since the arrival of our new-found prosperity in the mid-1990s. While the wealthy — in the context of the Celtic tiger — saw to it that their lairs were state-of-the-art residences, others were callously forgotten. Last week in the Dáil, the Minister asserted that a house is more than four walls. He stated that it is a place of shelter and comfort, a haven where one overcomes life's traumas and savours its triumphs.Let us take this one step at a time. Most homeless people would be happy to forget the philosophy and just have the walls. It is sad that despite significant advances in terms of employment, the end of mass emigration, improvements in living standards and higher incomes, it is more difficult in 2005 to buy one's own home, get a local authority house and live close to one's family and place of work. This should not be the case. It is not inevitable that greater wealth brings greater housing difficulties. A booming economy should not mean Dublin house prices become as high as in downtown New York. This housing crisis is man made. It has been created by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, in particular, and it is up to them to solve it.Housing has been this Government's greatest failure. In 1996, the price of a house stood at the equivalent of €88,000 in Dublin and €75,000 elsewhere in the country. Today, Permanent TSB-ESRI say the average price paid for a house nationally is €268,040. The average price paid for a house is €356,220 in Dublin and €231,425 outside Dublin. This is a national emergency. It may suit anyone who gained a place on the property ladder ten years ago, but it has resulted in a situation in which tens of thousands of people are excluded from the property market, and tens of thousands of those who manage to get onto the first rung of the ladder are paying cripplingly large mortgages. I remind everyone that the interest rate time bomb is ticking. The only way the ECB will go is up, and all it will take for the era of higher interest rates to return is an improvement in the German or French economies.I will outline the response of this lame-duck Government to this crisis. It abolished the first-time buyer's grant, failed to meet national development plan commitments on social housing, increased VAT on houses and housing materials, and imposed high development levies that add thousands of euro to the cost of every new home.The Government was elected on a promise to assist the voluntary housing sector so that the target of 4,000 accommodation units per annum envisaged under the national development plan could be reached and, contained within that plan, a commitment to build 10,000 social housing units every year. We know to our cost the value of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats promise. To defend such a record in this House would be the action of an extraordinarily arrogant Government. This Government has had nothing to do with the significant increase in the number of private houses built in the past few years. This is the result of the market's response to demand and the resulting prices are too high. The Minister and his colleagues need not tell us about the great success story of Irish construction, which is a case of private success in the face of public failure.We have been waiting for the housing needs assessment since March. It is now November. We cannot tackle our social housing problems if we do not even know how many people need houses. I repeat my call for, and my commitment to, an annual housing needs assessment so we do not have a situation where three and a half years go by without any fresh data on the subject. The Irish Council for Social Housing has made it perfectly clear that any drop in the housing needs assessment figures will have been a result of people leaving the waiting lists and entering the private rented sector. This results in a higher burden on the State through the strain on the rent allowance scheme without the gain of an increase in the social housing stock that should come with it.While I welcome anything that will alleviate the housing crisis and provide badly-needed affordable housing, I am sceptical that moves by the Government to swap land to provide affordable housing will work. Fianna Fáil is using it to hide its failure to meet housing targets. Swapping land is inefficient, open to abuse and may result in the State losing out financially. Instead the Government should honour its housing commitments and build on State-owned lands. Its commitment to build 10,000 affordable housing units will not be met and, at best, only 5,000 houses will have been built by 2007.At the 2003 ICTU conference the Taoiseach announced that lands at Gormanstown and McKee Barracks would be released for social and affordable housing. Earlier this year, at the 2005 ICTU conference, he announced that these lands would be made available to be swapped. These lands should have already been built on as promised. Financially, there is nothing to indicate that the deal by which land at Harcourt Terrace has been swapped for 193 housing units will benefit the State. If the Harcourt Terrace site had been sold on the open market, it could have garnered funds that would have built more than 193 units.The danger of exchanging a number of houses below the market value of State-owned land will always be there. While I was interested to hear the Minister refer last week and today to the praiseworthy work of South Dublin County Council, which is under the excellent chairmanship of councillor and former Senator, Therese Ridge, in providing affordable housing, the Minister's praise was a self-interested move to promote and praise land swapping.There is also nothing new in the Government's announcement that a new affordable housing agency is being set up. This is a mechanism designed to meet the housing targets, which the Government has failed to do. The current generation of young people is the first since the foundation of the State that cannot afford to buy their own homes. These people have been let down by this Government. The Minister has been critical of my party for what he has called our lack of policies. His cough has been softened of late — and mine today by ‘flu.

We proposed a house deposit savings scheme, similar to the SSIA scheme, to help young people who are saving for a deposit for a new home. Under the scheme, first-time buyers will receive €1 for every €3 they save provided those savings are used for a deposit on a house. We also proposed the abolition of stamp duty on second-hand homes up to €400,000, subject to review, bought by first-time buyers. This will mean a first-time buyer purchasing a second-hand home costing €325,000 would save €14,625. The Minister went part of the way in the last budget but the average house price in Dublin remains in excess of the new €315,000 threshold.We called for the frontloading of mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers to the first seven years of the life of a mortgage and reform of the social welfare code that currently forces young people out of the family home, adding upward pressure on house rents and prices. The income of parents should no longer be taken into account when deciding on the welfare entitlements of those who remain at home.We also called for an investigation by the Competition Authority into reports of building land hoarding in the greater Dublin area and some towns throughout the country. Fine Gael believes it is time for a new national housing agency. We envisage that the existing Housing Finance Agency will be expanded and strengthened to take on a new role in helping local authorities meet housing targets. The new body will be accountable to the relevant Oireachtas committee. Its functions would include monitoring county development plans to ensure consistency with the strategic planning guidelines and the national development plan investment programme, liaising with State agencies so transport, educational and recreational needs can be planned in tandem with accommodation provision, and driving the servicing of lands identified for housing by local authorities.This may involve direct management of provisions for water and drainage facilities where a lack of expertise or manpower on the part of individual local authorities inhibits the supply of housing. At the request of the local authorities concerned, the land agency could also take responsibility for co-ordinating land servicing across local authority boundaries, where joint schemes are more appropriate and cost effective. All housing authorities would give an account of actions that they had taken to implement the provisions of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. Where local authorities have failed, the legislation should be modified to enable the Government to enforce compliance.We must also consider apartment dwellers. Despite a commitment in the programme for Government, they are still left without proper State protection from their management companies and agents. Fine Gael will seek to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 by widening the role of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. If the amendment were passed, the PRTB would become the regulator in this area, imposing a pro-consumer code of practice on managing agents. The management fee would not be fully payable until management agents were in place and various services could be provided. At present, many builders demand payment of the first year's management fee before keys are handed over to new owners. This is despite the fact that the new owners may be moving into what is, essentially, a building site, with few of the services for which the fee is paid — for example, cleaning — being provided. Provision for an adequate sinking fund would have to be made from the outset. It has emerged that many managing agents have been setting annual fees without any provision for the large scale refurbishment that must be carried out every few years. That leaves residents with a shortfall and a choice of paying several thousand euro at once or living in a decayed physical environment.It is vital that immediate action be taken on the homelessness agenda. It is intolerable that, after a decade of prosperity, we still live in a society where homelessness is a daily fact of life for many people. We must all, Government and Opposition alike, work towards eliminating homelessness once and for all. I am convinced of the need for the State to invest heavily in move-on accommodation to facilitate this aim. Such housing is designed to assist homeless people to move out of homelessness and to ensure that vulnerable people do not become so. It is also vital that the root causes of homelessness, such as poverty and the twin scourges of drug abuse and alcohol dependence, be tackled. Focus Ireland's Hungry for Change report——

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I welcome the Minister. I am glad of the opportunity to discuss housing matters. The Minister has clearly set out the approach that the Government and he have taken on housing. I agree with what he said regarding any influence that we, as Oireachtas Members, can have on local authorities. When the dual mandate was abolished, we had the opportunity to have meetings at least annually with our county managers and directors of services on local authority matters. I always use the opportunity, when attending such meetings, to raise the issue of affordable and social housing. I have also spoken to our councillors on how we can speed up and promote affordable housing in various counties. I have always made it my business to discuss that matter.I take the Minister's point that the affordable homes partnership is obviously delivering very well in the greater Dublin area. I would like to see that expanded to every county. I do not believe that we have the one-to-one advice and consultancy of which the Minister has spoken in every county. Social and affordable housing is a matter of some controversy in County Galway, since there were rumours, when the Taoiseach launched the affordable housing initiative, that nearly every parcel of land would be built on. I refer in particular to lands owned by the former Western Health Board, now the western district of the Health Service Executive, which we debated in the House last week.The rumours are that lands we thought had been earmarked for health services and a health campus are now to be subject to housing development. It is unfortunate that such rumours are circulating. It has led to a public meeting being called for next Monday in Tuam. I received assurances on an Adjournment Debate from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, that the situation is not so. Such assurances were also provided in the Dáil by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power. When people ask what surplus land one has, they should also be told its intended use. I make no apologies for saying that the six acres of land in Tuam have always been designated for a health campus, including a hospital, an ambulance base, a child care unit and psychiatric services. That is how the question should have been answered. I very much regret that it was not answered in that way.What has happened regarding affordable housing is very good. We have now got some movement in Athenry, County Galway, and I would like to put on record what I was told on the Adjournment last week. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, stated that 22 hectares — a great deal of land — had been released by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, in Athenry, and that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has engaged with Galway County Council to advance the project. The Minister has informed me that the council proposes to develop an initial phase of perhaps 60 affordable housing units on approximately two hectares of the site.Preparatory work, including planning consultations, design and surveys, has been carried out on that portion of the site. An application for Part 8 approval under the planning regulations was advertised last week. That portion of the site will now go through the normal planning process. The balance of the Athenry lands, approximately 20 hectares, is the subject of a local area plan that is on public display until the first week of December. I understand that the council will be discussing the outcome of the public consultation process at its December meeting. The use of that portion of the site for the initiative will be assessed in the light of the local area plan process. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will work with the council to ensure the most effective use of the site.I am happy that this is on record in respect of affordable and social housing in Athenry. There has been much development in Athenry. A major roadway will bypass the down, part of the new road from Galway to Ballinasloe and Dublin. I am grateful that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, will be coming to Galway next Friday to officially open the Loughrea town bypass, something for which I have been pressing for a long time. The land in Athenry has now been designated for housing, and it is very important to state that.I have a query for the Minister regarding affordable and social housing and what he spoke about in respect of Part 5, which is a very good idea. There have been some queries regarding, for example, a contractor building 80 houses in Oranmore, with another 20 proposed in Headford. There is a good distance between the two towns and people have said to me that they are a community and that, with the council zoning land in Headford, there is no reason for them not to carry out their own projects. People feel their town will be the dumping ground, as they call it, for social or affordable housing, which amounts to 20% of the overall development. They feel another town will be subject to a similar project and that the social or affordable housing will again be built in Headford, where there is extra land available. The process has not been explained to communities or councillors. We should get local authorities to explain clearly to people what is envisaged in respect of Part V and the 20% of housing that is to comprise social or affordable housing.I am glad the Minister referred to progress in the housing sector. He referred to the completion last year of 77,000 units, which is double the completion level in 1997. This is a great achievement. Senator Bannon will accept that where people are trying to get on the property ladder, particular importance should be attached to affordable housing. The Minister stated this in this speech.The Minister also referred to the central heating programme, which has been a great success in respect of local authority housing. We should never lose sight of the fact that house improvements are very important in local authority housing, particularly for the elderly, regarding whom very good schemes such as the essential repairs scheme and housing aid for the elderly scheme operate. We should continue to provide funding for these schemes because many people apply to their local authority or health board for the grants.The disabled person's housing grant is of great benefit. Very good work has been carried out in this regard and we need to continue funding the scheme through which the grant is made available because it is the only scheme for carrying out improvements for people with a disability. I would like to see the Minister promote the scheme. I am glad he mentioned central heating because when local authorities refer to the thousands of extra houses that have been built, there is a danger of forgetting the existing stock, which should be refurbished and improved when necessary.When considering the five-year plan the Minister is promoting, we must also consider transport issues. There are serious difficulties involved in getting in and out of Galway city. One of the city's real problems is its design, although some will say it was not designed at all. We must consider constructing bus corridors to allow people get into the city if they are to live in Claregalway, which is between Tuam and the city, or if they are to live north or east of the city. This is a major issue and must be addressed.The Minister referred to water schemes. We have spent a lot of money on the public schemes and the group water scheme may present difficulties. There is now a welcome move to metering to tackle water leakage. Emphasis is now placed on bundling water schemes, as happens in the jurisdiction of Galway County Council. Much progress has been made in this regard. When one talks about housing schemes, one must also talk about planning and water and sewerage schemes. While progress has been made regarding water schemes, I am very disappointed the small villages and towns have not benefited from their fair share of investment in sewerage schemes. A lot of money is expended on the cities, which have huge populations. For example, there is a huge scheme for Mutton Island, which scheme serves Oranmore as well as Galway city, and water schemes on the Corrib serve areas that extend almost to the city. However, for approximately €1.5 million to €2 million, small villages could have housing and the necessary sewerage systems constructed, yet such schemes seem to be put on the back burner. Perhaps design, build and operate arrangements might represent a way to carry out improvements in this regard.On announcing the Estimates, the Minister referred to extra money being allocated to An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency. We welcome this very much. On the question of councils and planning, preplanning meetings are very important. An increasing number of these have been held, certainly in my county, and I welcome this. We had a system of prior notice for public representatives, which I regret has now been abolished by Galway County Council. This is the case even for councillors. It was very useful for an Oireachtas Member who could only be in the council offices one day per week. At our annual meeting, I said to the manager that the prior notice system should be in operation. Consideration should also be given to the question of having inurement clauses attached to planning permissions. Some councillors tell me there are life-long inurement clauses, which I find hard to believe, or ten-year inurement clauses. Those involved in preparing county development plans should consider whether a ten-year inurement clause is appropriate. We all know people must move house for various reasons, usually to obtain employment, and therefore the ten-year inurement clause is not proper. I do not believe it is constitutional. People from County Galway may have a particular reason for stating they want these clauses included.I very much welcome the rental accommodation scheme. From what I read and hear, rents have fallen, particularly for students in Galway, who had serious problems trying to obtain accommodation some years ago. I am sure the same is true for students in other cities. I hope the schemes to which the Minister referred will ensure the resources are made available in a good way and that we will have better-quality housing for all the households involved. I thank the Minister for what he has said and wish him well in his ministry.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I, too, welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well with his very difficult portfolio. Much has been said in the debate on affordable and social housing. I am disappointed over the slow progress regarding affordable housing. I noticed this week that the State has found an extra 235 acres to be made available for affordable housing. I fully support the initiative, established at the national partnership talks some years ago, to make land available to the State on which houses can be made available more or less at cost price. As the Minister probably knows, I was the one who proposed this at the talks. It would be very useful if the relevant committee could be urged to determine the obstacles that need to be cleared and where we can assist in the process.I am not standing here to be critical and know there are difficulties involved. I know the process has been entered into in a spirit of partnership but I am very conscious, two and a half years later, that we need to be able to show progress at the new session of national partnership talks, which will commence if we are lucky. This is one of the issues that will be prioritised. Goodwill will not be good enough and people will want to see progress. Once progress begins to be made, people will be satisfied. As stated by Senator Bannon, they are not looking for volume on day one but they are looking for movement. We will discuss this issue again on another day.The issue of most concern to me regarding housing is that of the impact of, and sequel and prequel to, the directive on installation which comes into operation in January. I recognise the Minister has only been in his current Ministry for the past two and a half years or, rather, for the past year. He has made such an impact that the period seems longer.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I know the feeling.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	143	At the very least I am confused and at another level I am deeply suspicious. I recall when former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds came back from Edinburgh with the famous €8 billion in EU funding in the early 1990s. We all cheered and believed it was great — it was. Some years later I looked at where that €8 billion went. More than €6 billion, in one form or another, went through one Irish company — the Minister knows the company, Cement Roadstone Holdings — either through roads, bridges, houses and so forth. I am not saying these things were not needed but this single company, which has also been mentioned on a number of occasions in Dublin Castle over the years, appears on the radar too often for my liking.In 1998, we became aware that the insulation requirements in Europe would move in a certain direction. We knew what would be required of us and people took the relevant steps in certain areas. However, steps were not taken in every area. From 1998 until the European directive finally emerged in 2002 or 2003 we continued to build houses in the old way. In that period almost half a million homes were built in the Dublin area and probably 90% of them were built with hollow blocks. I would be glad to be found wrong about this but it is still happening.The Senators present, with the exception of Senator Brady, will be appalled at that but it only happens in the Dublin area. The reason is that HomeBond has a huge influence in this and outside the Dublin area, houses have been built with cavity walls for many years. In fact, I did not know the cavity block was still in use until I saw the recent pictures of Dublin builders in South Africa building with cavity blocks. There is a good reason for using them there.What is wrong with cavity block? There are two or three things wrong. The first and most engaging fault is that it is close to impossible, if not impossible, to retrofit insulation as cheaply as in cavity walls. With cavity walls, one simply fills the cavity with insulation. That cannot be done with cavity block because the blocks are not in line. They cannot be in line or the structure would fall down. The only way to bring cavity block to the required level of insulation is by taking everything off the wall, scraping it back and installing an insulation bond.The Minister and Members are aware that only a few weeks ago the OECD issued a report which stated that Irish housing is 15% over-priced. I do not know if that is right or wrong but at some stage it will be over-priced. Even if it is not over-priced what I say next is of great importance. From next year every house in Europe, which includes Ireland, that is offered for sale will have to carry a certificate of insulation. The 80% or 90% of houses built for speculative purposes in the Dublin area for the last ten years will now, therefore, carry a low level of insulation certification. That means when somebody decides to buy a house and two houses on a road are for sale, one with a certificate of insulation at an appropriate level and the other with a lower level of insulation, it is clear which one will be bought.The people who were unfortunate enough to buy the cavity block houses over the last ten years will take the hit if there is a 15% drop in the market. There is no doubt about that. We talk about the property ladder but this could be like snakes and ladders. Just when somebody thinks they are up on the ladder, they could go sliding to the bottom again when they try to put their house on the market.The Minister has only been in office for a year and I do not know enough about this subject but I know the Minister well, having served with him in different places, so I will take his word for it when he tells me that he has investigated this matter. As bad as that is however, it now appears, and I hope I am wrong, that not only is this directive coming into operation next January but Ireland, in its wisdom, has decided to give an exemption period of the following two years to the Irish construction industry. It will be able to continue doing this for another two years. That is appalling and there is no reason for it.The Minister thinks logically about these matters and I do not believe his views would differ greatly from my own. This is something we have been aware of since 1998. This building method will have an impact on the people who buy houses and on energy and insulation. What are the reasons for giving a further exemption period when we are already years behind our European colleagues in this regard? The issue of insulation has different importance in different countries but I am anxious to hear a response to the points I have made.The Minister shook his head when I referred to cavity block and the amount of cavity block building taking place only in the Dublin area. It is happening because HomeBond is prepared to accept it in the Dublin area but not anywhere else. Can somebody explain that? Somebody who is building a house outside the Dublin area will not get the HomeBond certificate if the house is built with cavity block. There is no sense in that.Does self regulation work? It does if there is an oversight body. The oversight body must be either in the Minister's Department or it must be established by the Minister. I am very worried about this because we are creating a serious problem. If some of what I have said is wrong, because I am not an expert in this area, it is only partially wrong. I believe my comments are correct. I believe I have outlined the sequence correctly and I am forecasting a difficulty for the future. Nobody appears to be making any reference to it. I have been trying to come to grips with it because I do not understand it. I do not expect the Minister to be able to reply on this immediately but perhaps somebody in the Department could respond. I do not want a justification for where we are but to know why there is a different standard in Dublin, what difficulties there will be in the future and how the certificate of insulation will work.Whereas there is a European system for the measurement of insulation, which is simply the insulation qualities and so forth, Ireland is producing a unique Irish solution to an Irish problem. We are measuring it on the basis of heat escape through the roof or easy heat escape as opposed to heat insulation. If that is the case, it is not right. Why is it so? I trust the Minister to get to grips with this and to ensure we are not being led up the garden path on this issue. I have raised a number of issues that must be examined closely.The Minister will be aware that the British Government's chief scientific adviser during the week proposed to the Prime Minister that the government get involved in nuclear energy. The reason for that is Kyoto and energy conservation. I have discussed this with the Minister, perhaps over a pint or in the wrong place, but I will clarify it now. It relates to the energy issue. Senator Kitt spoke about water provision in various areas. Over the last 50 years or longer, people in Ireland have come together to establish water co-operatives to provide water. There have been difficulties with these schemes but they still exist.I wish to make a suggestion that is a little radical but doable. It is something that has taken place in other countries. I said in the House last year that if any community were to state that it was prepared to look after all its energy needs, through a wind farm or whatever, and its waste, without linking to a national sewerage system, it should get a tax break for doing that. I did not say anything further but I have examined this matter in the meantime, particularly on a small scale. I am also considering the issue of agriculture at present. I cannot see why agricultural communities would not be in a position to involve themselves in such ventures. They would have replacement crops and work within agriculture. They would save energy, bring us into line with our requirements under the Kyoto Protocol and do us all a big favour also. They could build a five, ten or 100 KW wind generator, one small enough to be hooked up to the grid without the need for a substation. I do not know the exact size required — it could even be a 50 KW generator — but the electricity generated could be shared among themselves and they could save on their bills.If people in what used to be part of our country until we changed the Constitution a few years ago — I refer here to the northern part — erect even a 1 KW wind generator on their house and the electricity generated goes back into the grid, they get only a tiny amount in clawback at the end of each year, although it is the principle that is important. Why can every new house being built not have a wind generator on the chimney and a solar panel on the roof? The solar panel would heat the water to about 30 or 40 degrees. How much energy would that save? In terms of the hollow block and all that goes into it — and I would like to get into the debate on the benefits of concrete and wood build — and having regard to our requirements under Kyoto, which are being decided on by the building industry, it is frightening.

They would be looking after themselves and raising awareness. They would be role models for the rest of the country. There is a company in Bellavary, the Surface Power Group, which is one of the leading groups in Europe in this particular area. Would it not be nice if, five miles from the rural museum or whatever it is called, the most modern village in Europe was looking after its own needs in terms of waste, electricity and wind generation? I am not talking about people wearing green wellies and tweeds; I am referring to ordinary people, not so-called green people, who want to make their contribution. These are good ideas. They are worth following up because they represent a step forward. There is a huge amount of development that can be done in this area.

The housing culture in this country is slowly changing. My own experience is of Dublin's inner city. When one considers the changes that have taken place there in recent years, it is obvious that our historical preference for home ownership is changing slowly. I want to record my admiration and recognition of the people in the 1980s — politicians and officials — who came up with the idea of tax incentives for construction, particularly in inner city areas. Those changes led to the construction boom, which has lasted for over 15 years. It continues to provide affordable accommodation and, as the Minister pointed out, to employ a large proportion of our population. At the last count, almost 225,000 people were employed in the construction industry. That would not have come about if we had the Bacon reports in the 1980s or without the foresight and the courage of those who came up with the scheme of incentives that kicked off the construction boom which continues today.My experience of local authority housing came about during my time with Dublin City Council. I understand from the Minister that up to 20% of local authorities throughout the country have not fulfilled their housing requirements this year. This indicates that there are problems throughout the country but my experience with Dublin City Council has been positive. There is no comparison between the quality and design of the housing Dublin City Council is constructing today and that which obtained in respect of the housing it previously constructed. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, flat complexes were erected and Legoland housing built and neither had the requisite facilities or infrastructure. There is no comparison in terms of what is being done today, particularly in the inner city but also in the suburbs. The provision of infrastructure and proper planning and design of local authority housing from the outset is key.The debate is raging at city council level in Dublin on whether to take the route of refurbishment of flat complexes or provide what is commonly referred to as "own door" housing. There is no argument in that regard. The only option is to provide people with proper family homes. When the Sherriff Street area was being developed, which was then a notorious local authority area, a section providing for the inclusion in the design of apartment blocks was included in the plan for the development of the area, despite the objections of a number of people. That was 15 or more years ago. It now transpires that those apartments blocks will have to be knocked down because they are at the root of many social problems. Concern about such problems was highlighted at that time, yet some local representatives encouraged people to remain living in poor conditions. The potential problems highlighted at the time have materialised.There is no debate over whether flat complexes should be retained or demolished and replaced with housing units. Land and space in Dublin city is at a premium but good design and planning will pay for themselves in the long run and will save a great deal down the line in terms of helping to prevent the emergence of social problems. A prime example of what can be done, and the success of a scheme when properly developed, is the Ballymun regeneration project. Anyone who drives through that area will note that it has been transformed, with the emphasis on own door, modern family housing. As Senator O'Toole said, those housing units are cost effective in terms of energy consumption. This is where planning and design at the early stages is crucial. As the Minister pointed out, 77,000 units — four times the European average — were provided last year. The highest level of that provision was in Dublin.We must continue to support first-time buyers. I take issue with Senator Bannon on a point he raised. When I bought my House in the early 1980s, it was as difficult to buy then as it is now. I would like a comparative study carried out on the relative cost of housing and incomes at the time to ascertain how the two compare. There is also the issue of people buying second homes for investment purposes. Families are investing in properties for the benefit of their children, their pensions or whatever.Interest rates at the time were excruciatingly high. The then Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, presided over a period when interest rates were at their highest in the history of the State.

Basic economics tell us that the strength of demand influences the cost of supply. The Government recognised this at an early stage and the entire thrust of policy has been to increase supply. Accordingly, house price inflation has fallen from 48% in 1998 to 11% now. As the Minister observed, house prices are moving in the right direction.The provision of affordable housing is key to reducing the waiting lists that exist in some local authority areas. I have, however, spoken to some Members whose local authority does not have a waiting list. It is not sufficiently highlighted that the needs of all those seeking housing in these areas have been met. Dublin City Council has a large waiting list but it is very much to the fore in regard to affordable housing. An example in my area is the docklands. Anybody who drives around that area will see it is totally transformed.The Part V allocations, including social and affordable elements, are coming through on developments initiated in the last 18 months to two years. Last week, for example, both a co-operative housing development and a private development with a 20% allocation of social and affordable housing opened on the south quays. These units are available to people with a connection with the area, whether they live, work or have family there. An increase in the numbers of Part V allocations is to be welcomed. The system will bear fruit in the end. In some cases, ten-year permissions were granted so it will be some years before they come through. We are on the right track, however.The Minister and I did a small calculation while Senator Bannon was speaking about the 193 units resulting from the swap that took place in regard to Harcourt Terrace. If we accept Senator Bannon's line, those units would cost some €300 million to produce in the space of four to six months on less than half an acre. In this scenario, it follows that an acre of land could cost between €700 million and €800 million. This shows how out of touch Senator Bannon is on the benefits of these schemes.While one-off housing is largely a rural phenomenon, it is becoming more prevalent in urban areas. Throughout Dublin city, houses are increasingly being built inside gardens. This is most prevalent in settled estates, whether originally council or private housing. We must monitor this issue.The Minister took part in a Dáil debate last night on management companies. Difficulties in this regard relate particularly to apartment complexes, of which there are many in my constituency. In many complexes, residents must pay a fee for security and general management services. It is not like joining a residents' association in that residents have no input into choosing the management company and their lease or purchase conditions may oblige them to contribute. They may or may not get adequate services. In a number of complexes in Dublin city, for example, there are major problems with refuse removal and maintenance of elevators, stairwells, windows and open spaces.We must tighten the regulations relating to the responsibilities and operation of management companies. I am aware the Minister is examining this issue. I do not agree it is primarily the responsibility of the apartment owner. The responsibility is on the developer initially to provide an effective management company and ensure it will fulfil all its assigned functions. A person moving into an apartment complex does not always have a choice in the matter and may have no input into its ongoing management.I thank the Minister, Deputy Roche, and the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, for coming to the House. We are on the right track in regard to housing provision.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe. I am delighted to speak on the important issues of housing provision and the construction industry. We live in unprecedented times in terms of the construction of both social and private housing. A figure of 240,000 was mentioned. Will the Minister of State clarify whether this refers to the numbers working directly in the construction industry? We must bear in mind the large numbers of ancillary jobs in terms of services and builders' supply. In this context, the figure of 240,000 is probably an underestimate. How was it arrived at?In Donegal, which is heavily dependent on the construction industry, young men leave Inishowen at 4 a.m. on a Monday morning, travel to Dublin or its outskirts in a van, begin work at 8 a.m. or 8.30 a.m. and continue until 7.30 p.m. They may work until 9.30 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday and until 7.30 p.m. on Thursday. At a time when it is advocated that we should not live in the past in terms of emigration, this represents a mass migration of workers from parts of Donegal to the east coast. The positive aspect of this is that young people can get work in the country and much money is being brought back to Donegal by workers in the sector. In terms of a sustainable future for the construction industry, however, we are living on a knife edge. We are self-deluded to believe this is sustainable in the long term.Senator Brady referred to the design of houses. I agree with what he said. People should have far more input in terms of offering their opinion and advice on the type of estates in which they wish to live and the nature of the recreational and amenity areas that should be attached to them. When completing housing application forms, people can choose where they want to live but that is all. A person gives his or her details — name, address, number of children and current circumstances — and indicates the area in which he or she would like to live. However, nowhere on a local authority application form can applicants describe the type of estate in which they would like to live or whether they would like extra recreational amenities, a park for their children to play in or a safe area where their children can play among their friends.People who go on housing application lists make no input whatsoever, which is wrong on the grounds that private applicants who wish to build on their own land have an input. They engage with architects. Their houses will be their dream homes where they will live and bring up their children. They have their own designs. They must work within a certain pattern or type of development but they have an input. A process should be facilitated or a mechanism created whereby applicants could have an input in terms of the type of estate design they would like. For example, 101 local authority houses were built in one Letterkenny estate in 1987. There were no recreational grounds, facilities or amenity or grass areas. Nothing was provided. After 18 years, successive residents' committees have failed in their attempts to get recreational facilities for the young people of that estate. This is wrong and is due to the fact that homework was not done initially and facilities and amenities not included. It is an ongoing battle. Successive hard working residents committees have faced obstacles and blockages in trying to express their needs for the people of the area. A plan is in place for the estate, Glenwood Park, and the current committee is working hard to make it happen. This is an example of poor planning and improper or no facilities, which was the wrong way to go about it.The events to which I refer happened in 1987 but similar events still happen today. Developer-led estates are being built. We are buying from the plans of private developers as a result of large demand. This is wrong because single mothers of one or two children in Letterkenny are living in large four bedroom houses but cannot afford heating oil. There are no back boiler systems, which would allow them to buy coal, or plans in terms of conservation of energy, nor are there finances for people entering local authority housing because the proper homework is not being done. Demand exists and we must meet it. Therefore, we must endeavour to try to provide for it but we can still do our homework in terms of what types of facilities or housing is needed.In the countryside, applicants who will live in SI houses or farmers' cottages, as we call them, have no input into which way their sitting rooms will face, on which side their bedrooms will be placed or into which part of their homes the early morning sun will shine. Such cottages will be their primary residences for the rest of their lives. This is an area we must examine closely and in respect of which we must give applicants an input. We may not be able to deliver everything they want but we could give them an input into some areas — for example, that relating to design — in which they can make an impression.I will speak in the absence of Senator Brady as he spoke in Senator Bannon's absence. On the issue of first-time buyers, we live in a different era. How can Senator Brady, a Dublin representative, say that young people are not under the same constraints or do not have the same overheads now as they did in the 1980s? That is rubbish. Young people will have millstones around their necks for the rest of their lives. They buy apartments and houses for €600,000, €700,000 or €800,000. If they won the lotto in the morning, it would not even cover their mortgages. I do not know why they play the lotto because they would still be in debt if they won. A new generation of people is up to its tonsils in debt. This is the reality and it is a dangerous phenomenon because who knows what will happen in respect of interest rates, property crashes, etc.? I am not predicting a doomsday scenario but people are under serious financial constraints, which is a significant difference to the situation that obtained ten or 15 years ago.On affordable housing, the Minister of State will be aware that Mr. Jack Nicklaus is to design a golf course in Carrigart. It is a lovely rural area and a nice spot. As a consequence of his arrival and input, the price of land will escalate. Farmers and people who own land in the area will benefit but the local community must be taken care of. Local people will be priced out of the land. A scheme that worked in Downings in north County Donegal is that of affordable housing. We should push for more affordable housing so that local authorities will buy land, service sites and help subsidise first-time buyers on the initial rung of the property ladder.The gender of which the Minister of State and I are members is being discriminated against in the housing market. Men whose marriages break up, either through no fault of their own or as a result of their faults, and who must live in small apartments or rental accommodation and still contribute to paying the mortgages on their family homes, find themselves at the bottom of the pile when they apply to local authorities to be housed. They are treated as single men. A 44 year old male who is not with his wife and three children is placed on the bottom tier of a local authority's ladder. This problem must be addressed. I compliment Donegal County Council because it is working proactively and on an all-party basis to try to address the situation. This can be done in every other local authority area. However, policy is top-down in nature and there must be policy change. Non-resident men are being discriminated against, a matter we should be attentive to and tackle in the near future.
#MichaelBrennan	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I also welcome the Minister of State and I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister, who has now left the House. Affordable housing is an important issue throughout the country, as is flexibility and the implementation of Part V housing. I wish to make a point to the Minister and local authorities that there must be flexibility if affordable housing is to be a success. This is a golden opportunity for the Minister to provide funding for land bank initiatives. At a time when local authorities are making town and village plans, it would be important, were they to avail of funding provided to the initiatives and work with developers through PPPs, to get a mix of housing acceptable to local communities. It would do away with many problems created by implementing of Part V housing at a later stage. People would know what type of developments were taking place in their areas and fully support them.The local authorities' voluntary housing scheme has been a significant success for the Minister of State's Department. It is a scheme whereby local communities the length and breadth of the county have provided housing units for their elderly. Together with the issue of health, it is important to give grant assistance for the care of the elderly in those housing schemes where extra allocations of units for them have been made. The care of the elderly could be provided in those fine complexes. I ask that the Minister of State examine the issue of this care because it provides a significant service at local level.Much has been said about the quality of housing in Ireland and it should not be forgotten that much has been achieved over the past ten or 20 years. A total of 240,000 people work in the building industry now compared with only 92,000 in 1994 and €18 billion was spent in the building industry last year. Three out of every ten houses in Ireland have been built within the past ten years, which is almost 500,000 houses, with an average of 77,000 houses built last year. This rate is four times the EU level and a rate of which any Minister or Government can be proud. It is important that this development is sustained. I congratulate the Minister on the guidelines for one-off housing.It is very important that the local authorities implement what the Minister has set out to do and that members of local authorities get what they want for their own areas. This can be achieved if they work together. In this regard the development levies moneys are being collected throughout the country. Much has been said about the lack of facilities which was the case in the past. The Minister must ensure that by working with national and perhaps national lottery funding, local and rural development can be grown.With reference to the Water Services Programme 2000-2006, much has been said about the lack of local facilities. It is a worry to local councillors that water and sewerage schemes are falling behind schedule. It is very important that the funding is made available in the years ahead to bring those initiatives to fruition. The development of land in an area is dependent on that scheme coming on stream. I wish the Minister of State well for the future.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I remind the Members opposite that as we speak, there are more than 50,000 on the housing lists. This situation will probably continue and worsen because more people are going onto the lists.I have some issues to highlight for the Minister of State. At this time of year, every year, the housing sections and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government know what the allocations will be for the coming year but they fail to notify the local authorities of them. In the case of Galway County Council in the past few years, it was May or June before the county council was notified of the allocation. It is a pity that the best part of the year for house building and construction was gone before the local authority was notified. It would be a very small exercise within the Department to rectify that situation but it would mean a lot for local authority forward planning, tendering and housing output in any given year.I welcome the commitment by the Minister to affordable housing which is a very important facet of the housing sector. It is probably one of the best schemes ever developed for the provision of housing. Sadly, its affordability will soon be gone out the window. For instance, any couple in an affordable house are outside the interest subsidy scheme if their combined income is in excess of €25,000. Even at the minimum wage, their combined income will put them in the bracket of being too rich to avail of this scheme.In a recently developed affordable housing scheme in Loughrea, County Galway, 12 of the house owners have asked me to highlight the fact that after one year in their houses and their combined incomes having risen above the €25,000 limit, they are too rich for the scheme. I ask the Minister of State to use a scale and help ease them out of that situation rather than a total cut off. The impact of this will mean that the attractive affordability of the house for a young couple will not be there in the future. This is a situation that must be faced. They are in today and out tomorrow, which is a black and white situation. The impact is very great on a young couple who find it difficult to make ends meet and I ask the Minister of State to consider a scaled down system.The building industry is very significant but I wish to raise the matter of unfinished estates. Houses are often purchased from the plans due to the great demand. When young people move into these estates, the chances are they will spend about five or ten years in that estate before basic services such as lighting, proper roads, playing facilities or open spaces are provided. Lawns and planting of the open spaces were part of the original planning application but they have been neglected.Local authorities and public representatives are drained by their efforts to force developers back into the estates to complete them. Developers of local authority estates are also to blame. The community and environment within a housing estate can be enhanced greatly if people have pride in their estate and this is what many residents' groups do. However, this will not happen if they do not have an estate of which they can be proud and if the developer has reneged on his commitment in order to build more houses and has left the estate unfinished.A very important feature of new housing developments is the fact that most developers and some local authorities insist on the provision of services such as crèches for young families. I was in Tuam two months ago when the first phase of a new housing estate was officially opened. The crèche was the first service provided on that site. I hope all developers could be encouraged to adopt this policy rather than utilising all space for the provision of housing and only providing other facilities if a corner is left over in some part of the site. In this regard local authority estates should also include some community facility. It might only take the space of one house to combine some of those facilities together but at least there should be an indication that the Department is looking at it.Doubtless some great quality housing is being built under the current throughput where the workmanship is top quality but alas, as is always the case, there are others where the quality and finish of the end product leaves much to be desired. There was a time in the past where in order to qualify for the local government grant, or a part thereof, an engineer or architect from the Department went on site to inspect the quality of work. Sadly, today that is not a requirement in the output of housing. I hope there will be some redress in this area.Recently I visited a group of students in a new three-storey development in Galway. They were beautifully designed houses but the emergency bells have rung on all sides because the floors on the second and third storeys started to subside, the plumbing and water pipes burst and everything in the house was destroyed. That was all down to faulty craftsmanship and input into the house. For the workmen, it was a matter of get in and get out. Probably there is great difficulty in such cases to monitor what is going on in that many of those major developments by builders are sub-let to other contractors who get in, do their work, walk away and wait for the other contractors to do the other finish fits. While we can say that there is considerable housing development going on in the country, we must query the quality of some of it. It is rushed. The reason for the rush is the quick turnover of resources and finance to get them sold. It is a pity.Many Senators spoke of design. I compliment the Minister of State's county council which has produced planning and design for housing, particularly rural housing. It provides a flagship to be the copied by all other local authorities. Anybody who has inspected it will confirm this. I was lucky enough to get a copy of it from my colleague, Senator McCarthy, to show it to my planning authority in Galway, which has been persistently saying "No" to issues like timber housing. Such housing can be assimilated well into the environment, if only the authority had the initiative and was pro-active in accepting that these are a quality product.I pay tribute to my local authority housing section in Galway as being probably one of the finest in the country. If the Minister of State provides the resources and the wherewithal for them to go ahead and take the initiative, and particularly in the allocations to which I referred, then the housing list, which currently stands at 50,000 or more — leaving aside the situation with regard to the homeless — can be very much reduced. In view of this I implore him, in the case the subsidy, that this aspect be investigated as a matter of urgency to relieve the difficulties.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this debate. I am happy to have an opportunity to speak on the subject of housing, in general but specifically in the local authority sector. The experience in different local authority areas can vary but I am proud of the record of my county and Sligo County Council for the progress being made in providing local authority housing. One need only drive anywhere in my native county of Sligo to see the level of work going on in the construction industry and all the housing being built, and I warmly welcome this. It is a great sign of progress. I remember when the building of a house in a parish or small town was spoken about for a month but I am glad that we have moved on from there. Big improvements have been made to villages, some of which have been transformed with new homes, shops and small businesses. In my area of south Sligo there has been significant expansion in the past number of years.It is important that Senators get an opportunity to highlight problems and ask that action be taken but where there are good developments, we should not be afraid to compliment the progress. That is why I am not afraid to say that I am confident the Government is doing a good job in giving local authorities the necessary resources to provide housing. It is not perfect at present but we should not lose the run of ourselves on where we are. Having been a member of Sligo County Council, I remember over the years we were starved of funding. The simple fact is there was no money available to build anything, particularly housing. That is why I have no difficulty in complimenting the former Ministers, Deputies Noel Dempsey and Cullen, and the Minister, Deputy Roche, and the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, for the funding provided which, in the case of County Sligo, amounts to €9.6 million this year. I warmly welcome the fact that this figure has increased by 100% over the past years.Senator Ulick Burke mentioned that there are 50,000 on the housing wait lists. I dispute those figures. In Sligo a review was done two years ago to update the list of people genuinely waiting on the housing list and everybody concerned was contacted. At that time there were approximately 850 on the list and when the forms were returned the number had fallen to 500. I do not know whether the case is similar in the rest of the country. I thought for once we might get a handle on this and see exactly how many people are genuinely on the list. As every politician here will know, we fill out application forms for constituents. Anybody looking for a rent allowance must fill out a housing application form. Similarly, anybody looking for a grant under the improvement in lieu scheme to improve his or her home must fill out a housing application form. I honestly believe that the present figures are cuckoo. I thought we had sorted it out but now I do not. I recently discovered that a student who was applying for some scheme had to get his name on the housing list. This must addressed. The figures should be properly monitored or something should be done to ascertain, for once and for all, how many people are genuinely on the housing list.The improvement in lieu scheme, to which I referred, is one of the schemes I want to raise with the Minister of State. It is an excellent scheme which is doing much good work. It is improving the homes of people, keeping them where they are used to living. The Minister of State might look at the income limits for the scheme. I would be involved in quite a number of cases under the scheme as I come from a rural part of County Sligo. There are difficulties with the income limit aspect of it but it is a great scheme. The people can get their work done. I recognise they do not pay back the full amount but if their house is sold within 15 years, the full amount can be recouped by the county council.In my area the shared ownership scheme has helped quite a number of people, who were genuinely on the housing list, to get a home of their own. It provided a start, getting them on the ladder. One can see from the lists, where the county councils must notify the county council members of the sale of these properties, that these people are buying their homes after two or three years. Perhaps the Minister of State should look at the income limits because it is a good scheme. It is not costing the State one cent because the price of the house is recouped by the local authority.I note that, increasingly, residents are buying these houses after two or three years. I could name ten people who got on the ladder at €140,000 or €150,000 for a three bedroom semi-detached house but who would not have done so but for the shared ownership scheme. After three years, their houses are worth €170,000 or €180,000. The scheme got them on the ladder and, thankfully, they are living in the houses and are moving on. Moreover, it is not costing the Government or the Exchequer one cent.There are positives and negatives to affordable housing schemes, which depend particularly on their location. In my home town the county council built 12 affordable houses but failed to sell them and had to take them back into its own housing stock and allocate them to people on the housing list. While it was welcome that 12 more applicants were taken off the housing list in that case, it is disappointing that the schemes work in some areas but not in every area.Essential repairs and disabled persons grants are beneficial, particularly for the elderly, but they are very restricted at present. While I am not sure the position is the same in every local authority area, to get an essential repairs grant in the Sligo County Council area one must be over 65 years of age and one will only get the grant for repairs to a roof and not for windows or doors unless these are part of an overall job. I understand the grant in Sligo is for 50% of the cost. The rules governing the disabled person's grant are similar to those for the essential repairs' grant in that applicants must be elderly and receive 50% of the cost. The grant schemes are not working as they should be.I know of the case of a 53 year old mentally disabled and mildly physically disabled person who lives in her own home. She needs new windows and doors to improve her house so that she can live comfortably. However, she does not qualify for a disabled person's grant because it does not cover windows and doors and she cannot qualify for an essential repairs' grant because she must be over 65 years of age to do so. This person is caught in a trap, which should not happen to a genuinely disabled person who needs improvements to her house to ensure that she is able to stay there. These schemes are not working as well as they could.I have experience of the excellent work done, mostly by FÁS workers, on local authority estates, which should be encouraged because it makes a difference. The more improvements are made in such estates, the happier the residents are and the better their quality of life, which can be proven.I wish to refer to the new phenomenon of housing agencies, such as Cluaid, Respond and Focus Ireland, which seem to be springing up throughout the country. I was personally involved in the development of a scheme of houses in Ballymote, as a member of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul conference which received funding and grant-aid to build 28 houses for elderly people beside a nursing home. It is undoubted that the development has given a new lease of life to the elderly people housed there, located as it is beside the church, station and nursing home.Young families are also grateful to get a house through a housing agency. When they move in, their circumstances might not be that good but when they get work, their lives improve and their incomes begin to rise. However, rents also rise and such families find they can never buy their houses whereas families moving into local authority houses can buy their houses. This might not be an issue for discussion in this debate but it is coming down the track. Somebody will make a challenge on the issue in the future. It is not fair that such people are not allowed to buy their houses.Senator Brady referred to the benefits of tax incentives for the inner cities. While I realise the issue does not involve the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I emphasise the effect of the rural social tax incentive scheme in my own area, where one can buy a fully finished three bedroom semi-detached house for €165,000 as a result of the scheme.The income limit for first-time buyers should be increased because house prices have increased considerably in recent years. An issue raised with me concerned first-time buyers purchasing a site to provide their own house. Some first-time buyers on marginal incomes find they must pay stamp duty of €4,000 or €5,000 on a site. We should encourage and help such people, not penalise them with a tax they cannot afford at that time in their lives.Reference was made to single fathers. I do not know what policies exist nationally but I know Sligo County Council has no policy in this regard. A father who visited my office last week had been abused by his wife. He had to leave his home with three of the children and is living with friends and neighbours, moving from house to house. While that may be hard to believe, it is the truth. A complaint was made to the Garda, which was aware of the abuse this man suffered. However, there is no policy in place to deal with such cases, a matter which we must consider.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and welcome the fact we are debating this important issue. I thank the Leader for arranging the debate. It is opportune that we discuss an issue as critical as housing, particularly in light of the report of the all-party committee on private building land and the more recent and more important report of the National Economic and Social Council, Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy. Having perused that document in great detail, I believe it raises a number of important issues and says exactly what needs to be said about the current state of housing. It gives a clear indication of the direction policy should be moving. We could learn much from the recommendations of that report.The NESC report urges the Government, social partners and others involved in this area to take action along three lines of policy, namely, the provision of social and affordable housing, the need for integrated sustainable neighbourhoods and active land use management. In highlighting the issue, the NESC described what needed to be done as "a major national challenge which bears comparison with other great challenges that Ireland has faced and met in the past half century". That is significant and spells out the extent to which this issue poses challenges, as well as the opportunities that may arise in dealing with those challenges. Despite the serious difficulties we experienced in regard to economic activity, emigration and unemployment, particularly in the 1950s, the challenge posed by housing today is put on a par with these issues. It is amazing that the NESC proposes the same course of action to deal with the issue of housing.After almost nine years of rule by the same Government parties and several years of major economic activity, the country is now awash with money and there is great opportunity in terms of expenditure. Senator Scanlon referred to various local authority schemes. In the past, the money was not available for these schemes but, thankfully, it is now available. This gives us real impetus in terms of how to progress a particular argument in favour of this issue or how various methods or proposals would be used in terms of trying to allay further decline in this area. Thankfully the money is there. A great number of negative effects have surfaced as a result of economic activity. For example, there are now twice as many homeless people as there were nine years ago. More families have been evicted in recent times than under British rule during the land war in the 19th century. That is an amazing statistic. We have seen the highlights and the reports, but these issues do not make the headlines. They do not make nice reading and do not sell newspapers. Therefore, not as much attention is paid to them in print or on the air as to other issues.We are now living in a society which has pushed generations of people into the commuter belts. We have created a new type of urban living, where people leave their homes early in the morning, get caught in gridlocked traffic and are out all day trying to earn the money to pay mortgages, etc. It is an anti-family existence.We have all passed through villages that used to have a small petrol station, shop and community fibre, but this is no longer the situation. There are literally blocks and blocks of apartments and houses on display and this has created a new type of pressure on people. All of this has come about at great expense, ultimately to family life. The quality of life is dying out and that is the major issue. Younger people in particular have been pushed into these commuter belts, away from the supports they are used to and that are needed, in many cases, in terms of the particular forms of child care required.That is an enormous cost to society, regardless of the economic benefits. The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is well aware of the house price problem, because he is a Corkman. I was in Kinsale last Monday on a leaflet drop. There are now at least three housing estates which were not there three years ago one of which is a fine development. When one considers the debate as regards unfinished housing estate developments, this is one which, thankfully, is finished to a high standard. However, houses in the front row are now costing €580,000 per unit.As one passes further west the prices go down, but there are generations of people in that town who cannot afford to either buy or build. There are people earning relatively good money who are living in very poor accommodation, namely, apartments owned by those who have invested down through the years. Such people, in terms of paying rent, running cars and coping with the normal costs that affect those in their particular category, are now faced with spiralling house prices. At one time one could nearly buy a small village for €580,000.That type of money is amazing. We are living in an area with all the benefits and attractions in terms of tourism and it is the place to be during the summer period. However, the reality is that there are people in those towns who will never even aspire to owning their own homes. Significantly, there is a major shortage in terms of the provision of affordable and social housing that could allay that problem.Were it not for the manner in which the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, dealt with the issue, we could have had almost 80,000 extra units to deal with this growing problem. Instead, he gave them back to the developers. It meant there would be more and more young people on housing lists, which have doubled in recent times.I take the point which was very well made by Senator Scanlon as regards the criteria that are applied in terms of getting someone onto a housing list. We all know of people on housing lists who need to get a council house, and why they are on the list. However, others are on the list because the scheme they want to apply to or avail of requires that their application for a house is submitted to the local authority. This is an administrative bureaucratic measure which creates a smokescreen and muddies the issue. It tends to hide the real number of people who are on the housing list to be housed, and not to satisfy a level of bureaucracy that applies as regards the administration of a different scheme by the local authority. That is a point worth making.The answers to the questions I raised are no mystery. In the past eight and a half or nine years, instead of pursuing policies that can allow people to own their homes at affordable prices, this Government has been intent on stimulating the property market, rubbing shoulders with the developers and speculators and forgetting about those who really suffer. Those suffering are younger persons with housing needs who are now being asked to pay exorbitant amounts of money to own their own homes. Ireland has one of the highest rates of home ownership in Europe. It has been a strong tradition that a person grows up, receives his or her education, becomes employed, starts earning, settles down and buys a house. It is one of the first steps that any young adult will take in this country.However, we are fast approaching an era where a majority of younger people in the mainstream, earning relatively good money, will still not have enough to pay the exorbitant prices needed for a house. There is one critical factor in this debate. The Government of the day is the one organ responsible for subscribing to that problem and allowing a situation to develop whereby people can no longer afford to buy their own homes. It has been in office for almost nine years to deal with the issue. There is no point in realising a year and a half from a general election — somewhat like the Tánaiste on the issue of health — that this has now become a problem. The Tánaiste has been a Member of the Cabinet for almost nine years, but only now realises the extent to which the health service is in absolute chaos. This issue is somewhat similar, where Ministers start to propose what needs to be done, barely a year and a half before a general election, having spent the previous nine years ignoring the problem.There have been conflicting views in terms of when the prices would start to drop, the crash begin or when house prices would revert to levels previously accepted as normal. Many such predictions were made, but none of that has happened. My party, particularly its spokesman on the environment, Deputy Gilmore, was very much to the fore as regards putting down solid proposals as to how this issue might be tacked. One of the proposals involved intervention. We were told by various Ministers that this was not possible, that the housing issue should be left to the market and that supply would increase and this would meet the demand. Thankfully, supply has increased and that is to be welcomed.The Minister of State can say in his reply that we have so many housing units. One does not have to be a second Dr. Peter Bacon to realise that this country is reaching unbelievable levels in terms of housing output. However, the real issue is the number of people who are not occupying these houses at affordable prices. There is a complete lack of coherent policy as to how the Government has tackled the issue. That is the real issue, namely, affordable and social housing, and the manner in which young people are being prevented from owning their own homes.House prices are now three times what they were eight years ago. Despite all the talk and gobbledegook about stabilising house prices, the latest figure from the Minister of State's Department shows that the annual percentage increase in new house prices is 11.8% nationally, 7.4% in Dublin and just over 10% for second-hand houses. That is enormous. For good measure, no pun intended, the Bank of Ireland states that prices will rise by 10% this year and rents are already starting to increase again. We argued for intervention in the past and we have repeatedly asked the Government to tackle this issue constructively. Unfortunately, those requests were not met by a proactive response, but rather by a type of absurd intervention.I can recall my earlier days in this House, in late 2002, when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government at the time was Deputy Cullen. He sat in that chair and had the cheek to hand back almost 80,000 affordable sites to developers because they had embarked on a type of social pleading with him and his colleagues, more than likely at the Galway races, although we will not get into that debate.In Christmas week almost 80,000 affordable units were handed back to developers and speculators. Some of those would have gone a long way towards sorting out the enormous housing problems in Clonakilty or Kinsale where prices have now reached unbelievable levels and where the supply of social housing is falling well behind because the local authorities have been starved of decent resources and funding to tackle the issue. Less than six months after the general election, having boasted about his exploits in Government during the previous five years, the Minister handed back 80,000 affordable sites. That was done when the Government dismantled Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was unforgivable. Eighty thousand units would have gone a long way to sorting out this mess, but they were not given to the young people who need them. Instead they were given back to the builders in Christmas week.Next, the Minister and his foot-soldier Ministers of State abolished the first-time buyer's grant. We were told at the time by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, that €3,800 was not much money. It may not have been to someone like Mr. McCreevy and his colleagues in the Government, but it is a lot of money to the many thousands of young people who could have availed of the grant. That was especially unforgivable. Another great measure was to reduce stamp duty for investors, designed to put pressure on the hard pressed young couple, along with the urban renewal incentives for new buildings.There has also been a huge increase in development charges and rural-based Members will know of this better than most. The development charges are there for the provision of public lighting, footpaths, roads and so on, yet none of these facilities have been provided in many rural areas, in spite of an increase in the charges. In one-off rural houses, this works out at around €2,500 per house, plus the cost of abolition of the first-time buyer's grant in the case of young couples who wish to build houses for themselves in rural Ireland.Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was botched in its inception, it was poorly thought out, badly introduced and abandoned in Christmas week in 2002. The Government abolished the first-time buyer's grant and increased development charges. I urge the Minister and his colleagues to take on board the recommendations of the NESC. We are 18 months away from an election and the thousands of young people in Ireland will not forgive the Government for the manner in which people have been pushed onto housing lists, pushed into poor standard rented accommodation and evicted from their houses. In the last few years, more people have been evicted from their houses under the watch of the Taoiseach and his Government than there were under British rule during the land war of the 19th century. That record is a disgrace to any politician who has the gall to knock on a door and look for a vote.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and I compliment him and the Minister for their work in the Department. I have listened carefully to many contributors this evening and I know some of them are young and have not been in local authorities. One does not have to go too far back before 1997 to realise the plight in which many people found themselves when waiting for housing. They often had no hope whatever in getting accommodation as lists were growing longer. I compliment the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Cullen, on the developments that have taken place.I wish to make a point about housing estates and private developments. Some developers are top class, some are average and some are very poor. The Minister should look at the planning conditions for housing estates. If someone gets planning permission to develop housing estates, they have five years to start or complete that development. In many cases, the estates have been built after 12 months. Unfortunately, some of the essential services are not in place, such as lighting and footpaths. I recognise that there are some very good developers who do an excellent job, but when private estates are given planning permission, that permission should ensure that the essential services are in place.I appreciate the Minister's announcement that three out of every ten houses in the State have been built in the last ten years. That is obvious, given the amount of excellent developments that have taken place throughout the country. In the past, people did not have the wherewithal to take on board the development of housing. House prices should be controlled in some shape or form. It appears that some of the developers advertise houses off the plans and as the first four or five houses are sold, the price is increased substantially because the demand is there. That is unfair as the cost of materials have not increased at the same rate that housing costs have increased. We must look at that issue.I would like the Minister to take on board the issue of the selling of local authority houses. With regard to tenant purchases, some people received houses in rural areas and were given a site by their parents for a nominal fee. After a few years, the family would wish to buy out the house. The council charges the full market value, including the price of a site, whereas in some cases those concerned had to buy a site and were entitled to do so. However, where the local authority gets the land for free or for a nominal fee, the sale price of the house should be reduced. I ask the Minister to have a look at that.I compliment the Department for making funding available for Traveller accommodation throughout the country, be it housing or halting sites. A lot of money has been made available. Unfortunately, many local authority members have failed in their duty to provide proper accommodation and money was sent back to the Department every year because we did not move on the issue.The Minister must take a stand with city and county managers and local authority members on the issue of transient sites. There are serious problems every year with a number of Travellers moving out of houses and into other areas. There is a responsibility to provide transient sites and the cost of doing so is not great. We should be able to do it reasonably quickly.Local authorities must move ahead with local area plans. In some counties, villages are being developed and that is to be welcomed. It gives an opportunity for people to live close to services such as the church, the shop, the school. People should not be forced to move out to rural areas and they should have problems with planning permission, with getting children to school and needing to get a second car. Local authorities should provide private sites at those locations, so that people will have an opportunity to buy land for development close to the services at a reasonable cost.Earlier, Senator O'Toole commented on the standard of construction of some of our housing stock. I wish to respond to this as I am reasonably familiar with the building trade. Undoubtedly, in some cases, it leaves much to be desired. In particular, he referred to cavity wall buildings. Such buildings may be insulated without any difficulty and can be executed to an extremely high standard. In terms of durability and strength, this must be balanced against timber frame construction. I have serious issues with regard to some timber-framed buildings under construction at present. While they may meet criteria with regard to insulation, they may fall short in other respects.As far as change is concerned, once planning permission has been granted for a particular type of structure, the Department is not in a position to force change on those who received it. The planning regulations which were the law of the land at the time when planning permission was granted remain in force until it expires. Perhaps I am mistaken and something may be done by ministerial order. However, my understanding is that if one receives planning permission for a particular type of structure, one is entitled to build it. Permission has been granted for quite a number of houses of the type to which Senator O'Toole referred and such buildings will continue to come on stream.This is similar to the introduction of affordable and social housing schemes into planning legislation. Such housing did not come on stream overnight either. When the schemes were introduced, everyone thought it was a great idea. However, because so many planning permissions had been granted previously, the benefits are only now becoming apparent. Such houses are coming on stream throughout the country and make a great difference to many young people who are able to purchase a house at an affordable price. The affordable housing scheme was an outstanding initiative on the part of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Before leaving the subject of housing construction, I wish to touch upon the standard of materials. Recently, I encountered doors which were being sold as solid doors but which left much to be desired. They contained a MDF-type material with a finish that appeared solid. However, if one put a socket through such a door, one realised that one was being had. Thousands of such doors are being installed throughout the country, as people look at them and believe them to be solid. Standards must be examined in this respect.Local authorities and the Department must be given credit for the standard of local authority housing under construction at present. Members may recall a time when white deal windows of extremely poor quality construction were installed. Now, one receives a house that is on a par with, if not better than, those constructed in the private sector. Much money is being spent in this regard, and rightly so, as one gets a house of high quality. When local authority tenants move in, such houses are painted, kitchen areas have floor tiling, double-glazed PVC windows have been installed and central heating is available. In some cases, features contained in local authority housing are not available in private developments.As far as two-storied dwellings in local authority schemes, particularly in our towns, are concerned, the Department has changed its policy in respect of downstairs toilet facilities. This a worthwhile change, which I hope continues, whereby if someone has the misfortune to be injured in any way, such facilities may be developed easily on the ground floor to avoid people trying to climb stairs.The changed circumstances of applicants has come to the fore recently at local authority level. Once, when people applied for local authority houses, it was par for the course that married couples had two or three children before they were granted a local authority house. At present, given the enormous amount of housing that has been developed, we find that single parents are able to get a local authority house, and rightly so. However, this demonstrates that we have come a long way.As far as both local authority housing and private developments are concerned, the developers and local authorities get away easily in their failure to provide some kind of children's playgrounds or facilities on the estates. Such provision is necessary and we should make changes to ensure this happens in future. Local authorities should take on developers, possibly by imposing a new charge or by using some of the existing charges to ensure that playgrounds are provided for children in such estates.The rental accommodation scheme to which the Minister commented in his contribution is a worthwhile initiative. Unfortunately, it is being abused up to a point as unquestionably, people have moved out of good accommodation in order to have their rental accommodation paid for.Local authorities should be obliged to provide more private site accommodation in our towns and villages. Often, the local authority may provide ten, 20, 30 or whatever number of such sites. While they may sometimes be disappointed that a smaller number of people apply for them, it is worthwhile to provide such sites.My final point concerns land banks for local authority houses. Some years ago, my local county council was forced to sell off land. It is important that local authorities provide a landbank for the future, because the demand for housing is ongoing and we will require a sufficient amount of local authority land. I thank the Minister and the departmental officials. Matters have dramatically improved in recent years.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome the opportunity to debate the housing issue. At present, we are building too many houses, of the wrong type, in the wrong place. Part of our current economic growth has something of the air of a mirage. One quirk of the statistical methods we use to judge our economy is that any activity is considered to count towards growth in the economy, regardless of whether, from a common sense perspective, it would be regarded as real growth or whether such activity is sustainable in the long term.When the present day is compared to the height of the Celtic tiger period, the periods differ in both the quantity and quality of growth. According to the figures, at present our economy is growing at a slower rate than it did during the late 1990s. However, an even more important change may be discerned when we consider the composition of the growth and its driving force. In the Celtic tiger period, growth was driven by our manufacturing and services outputs, which was reflected in the growth of our exports. In contrast, at present the two drivers of growth are consumer spending and construction activity. Our manufacturing is stagnant and there is very little growth in exports.This means that at present, our growth is of an altogether different type to that which we enjoyed previously. It is of intrinsically less value and in particular, it is less sustainable. In the long run, we cannot earn a living simply by taking in one another's washing. Our long-term prosperity and capacity for growth will depend on areas in which we are not doing well. The fact that we boast a statistically higher growth rate than the rest of the EU tends to mask that reality from us.One of the dangers of the housing boom is that it cannot go on. The number of houses we are building is ahead of demand. For many years we have been playing catch-up on providing houses, but those days are over. In five years we will not need to build the number of houses that we are now building. If we build that number we will have a glut of housing and the market will collapse through an imbalance between supply and demand. That issue is not of immediate concern because the market will look after it and builders will stop building as soon as the demand dries up. When that happens our economic growth as we measure it statistically will take a sharp fall. We need to be ready to respond to that correctly when the time comes. In particular, we should resist the temptation to prop up the construction industry with subsidies or tax reliefs just to keep the economic growth figures up.Although we can rely on an unregulated market to reduce the number of houses we build in the future, we cannot rely on it to control the kind of houses that we build and where they are built. One need only travel around the country with one's eyes open to realise that we have problems in both these areas.Despite the dramatic change over the past ten years, the balance between the number of apartments and houses is wrong. I do not have the figures but the proportion of Irish homes that are apartments is low by international standards. While I do not suggest we force people to live in a flat when they want to live in a house, there are certain family circumstances in which it makes more sense to live in a flat, for example, the large and growing number of people who live alone. We should, through planning and zoning regulations, make it easier and more attractive for people to live in apartments. Instead of allowing our cities to spread endlessly into the countryside, we should make a consistent effort to increase the density of our housing within the traditional city limits.If we do not increase overall housing density, the situation will deteriorate. Dublin has already sprawled to an unacceptable extent but this process will continue unless we set our minds to stop it. I was in Australia last week, where one can see just how bad this situation can become. Around some of their big cities the suburbs sprawl in every direction for up to 100 km. and more.We can control how the shape of our housing develops. The amount of housing we need depends on population demands, and there is little we can do about that, but we can control the kind of housing we provide and where it is provided. If we put our mind to it, we can stop the sprawl of our cities from getting worse. We cannot unbuild what we have built but we must learn to manage it.The Australian Government recognises the problem of sprawl and has started to address it. The future is still in our hands but we need the will to address the problem. As we look around the cities and see the number of new apartments, far more than 20 years ago when they were practically non-existent, we are inclined to think the balance is right. We have fewer apartments compared with homes than other countries. Traditionally 20 or 30 years ago everybody had a house with a garden but if we do not take a different attitude the urban sprawl will continue and we will not be doing the sensible thing for our population and the environment.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. When we debate this important topic in this House we generally have a widespread and reflective discussion and this afternoon's debate has been no exception. I thank Deputies Noel Ahern, Batt O'Keeffe and Roche for their attendance. I read the Minister's speech with interest. While he presented convincing figures on the strength of the housing market, its impact on the economy and the state of housing health as far as the Government is concerned, housing statistics can be twisted and turned in many ways.If we are to ensure that housing, which is a basic and absolute need for every citizen, becomes an entitlement, we must address certain issues. Some of my colleagues said despite the huge number of houses being built annually and over the past six or seven years, we still have an enormous waiting list for local authority housing. I appreciate that Deputy Noel Ahern has greater responsibility for local authority housing than the other Ministers and I am sure he is taking note. It is disappointing that with so many houses being built, the local authority lists at best remain static and in many areas have increased. We need a broad debate on that issue.So many housing issues must be addressed, such as quality and energy efficiency raised by Senator O'Toole, Senator Quinn's design arguments and the issues of affordability, shared ownership loans and local authority housing. It is surprising that after 60 or 70 years of our State we have never had a Minister or Department dedicated to housing. Housing is a crucial issue that affects our economy and society on an ongoing basis and requires particular political attention. While the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has always had a junior Minister responsible for the housing budget, for at least one Government term there should be a Cabinet Minister to look at the broad range of issues from a housing perspective.The many issues, for example, the issue of auctioneering which Senator Ross raises regularly, are dealt with in a piecemeal fashion but if we had the benefit of a dedicated Minister for housing for five or ten years he or she could begin to make a real impact. It is not just a question of building 70,000 or 80,000 houses per annum. For every house built we discover new problems because of issues that have not been addressed.The Minister made a passing reference to the rental market and spoke on the need to modernise and develop the rental sector. I agree, but nothing has happened in that area. We have not been able to move people from the concept that rental accommodation is second rate. That is an Irish and British view but not a European view. We should make it attractive for people to invest in providing top quality, affordable rental accommodation. If a person is lucky enough to have sizeable financial reserves and invests them in a shop, pub or hotel, he or she is generally considered a great pillar of economic activity. However, if he or she invests in private rented accommodation and makes eight, ten or 20 units of accommodation available for letting, we almost automatically question the motive.I would like us to have a fresh look at rental accommodation. It should be a very valid form of economic activity and social progress to invest money to provide rental accommodation, and our laws regarding landlords and tenants must obviously be reviewed. However, it should be proper to invest money to make rental accommodation available. On the other side of the equation, there should be absolute guarantees of security and fair rents for tenants. That is the one issue that we have never properly addressed. It will have to be part of the jigsaw of solutions that we require in a modern, more flexible society.When discussing housing in general in the House, we obviously speak a great deal about social housing, a very good concept that I strongly supported over many years as a member of Cork County Council. However, I am disappointed that we have not advanced the social housing project as far as I thought we could have done. I appreciate that, with the Part V procedures, houses are, in a sense, only beginning to come on stream. The Minister of State and his colleagues will have to drive that much faster and more strongly. There appear to have been too many cases of local authorities and builders taking for ever to decide to trip the Part V mechanism. With 50,000 or 100,000 people seeking housing, we must advance this one method of resolving their needs.On affordable and social housing in its broadest forms, shared ownership loans, something I very much supported in their early years when they were neither profitable nor popular as far as most people were concerned, have allowed many people to house themselves who otherwise could not have secured accommodation. We must examine the regulations concerning the shared ownership loans, the terms and guidelines, to ensure that more people qualify for such a loan. It is great when one is able to assist a person who had no great expectation of owning his or her own house to use the shared ownership system to enter the market, and we must expand that scheme.From the perspective of local authority house building, I appreciate that if the Part V procedure works well, local authorities will be building, individually or directly, fewer than heretofore, but they will still continue to build a significant number. One issue that always concerns me, and on which I spoke at local authority level, was the delay in initiating building projects. We received an annual housing grant, and it could be 18 months, 24 months or, in some cases, three years before the houses were built. We appear to take a very conservative view of housebuilding in this country. Local authorities simply would not consider fast-build methods such as timber-frame or steel-frame construction. We have a very reputable steel-frame construction company in Cork. I would like to see local authorities using their money in such a way that the housing stock is built more quickly than hitherto.Senator O'Toole raised very valid issues concerning installation, energy conservation and so on. Local authorities should take a lead in that regard. It is interesting that in Cork, the northern division of the county council, in conjunction with Blackwater Resource Development, the LEADER company, is conducting a pilot project on sustainable living. In the village of Lombardstown, which is not in my constituency, they are building 20 houses using a sustainable development concept, with all the necessary environmental measures, including solar panels and geothermal heating.Our local authorities should be pioneers in that regard. However, energy conservation and broader environmentalism should be taken on board. I hope that the Minister will request the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to provide grants in the budget for insulation and energy conservation in older housing stock. It is a necessity and will pay for itself financially and environmentally time and again. I ask that the Minister consider that suggestion.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I would like to share time with Senators Henry and Ross.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and this opportunity to speak on housing, an issue that we all know is among the economic challenges that continue to face us. The reason relates in part to those not able to afford a home of their own and who are reliant on local authority or social housing. There are also single people in jobs and young married couples who, because of the affordability issue, cannot buy homes in areas that they might have expected when growing up. We see ever more people forced to move further away from where they grew up in cities and towns and into country areas. Their moving away from home will create other issues in future.Local authorities should go out on the open market and buy houses throughout the country. They should not be tied to their own local authority area. Perhaps I might take Galway city as an example. There is no reason that Galway city should not be able to buy small numbers of houses in new developments all around the county, renting them through the social housing scheme to people on its housing list. When I left Galway City Council two years ago, the housing list had approximately 1,300 or 1,400 people on it. I imagine that it is now well past 2,000, owing to the changes that have happened.If we are to have any hope of housing those people within a realistic timeframe, we must do something radical and new. Regarding how we are to pay for those houses, I point out that we spend a fortune every week in this country providing rent allowance to private landlords. That rent allowance would pay back any mortgage gained on a long-term investment from the bank. If we had a method allowing the local authority to borrow the money from a bank or an Exchequer fund, paying it back with money already being expended on rent allowance, we would ultimately have people housed in accommodation and completely integrated throughout the whole country. No large local authority estates would be built to store up future social problems. We would have true integration and better housing stock throughout the country at no additional cost. I would like the Minister of State to take that on board.At a previous discussion in this House, I raised the issue of stamp duty, which I know does not come under the Minister's brief. I have stated before that no stamp duty should be paid on family homes or by first-time buyers. If I am in a family home but am moving to a bigger one or a different area, I should not pay stamp duty when I sell up. It is a tax on the family that should not be paid. One can quite justifiably increase stamp duty on second or third homes, progressively raising the rate. If people can afford to buy a second or third house, they should pay the tax that it is their duty to pay, and I apologise to no one on that account. However, there should be no stamp duty for first-time buyers or on a family home. If one has a family home and is moving to a second one, there should be no stamp duty.I would also like to raise the issue of Part V. It may not have been the best idea to allow developers to pay off their commitment under Part V of the planning process. I was disappointed when that changed. From the perspective of integration, I would much rather see one, two or three houses in all sorts of areas throughout the country available for people to buy under the affordable and social housing schemes.I am disappointed that happened but I recognise we have yet to see the full benefit of the scheme. We should examine it closely. A considerable amount of money is being made by people in the construction industry and property market and those who have benefited most are the property developers. The landowners who sold land have certainly been well paid therefor, but the land they sell is sold two or three times thereafter, doubling in value each time. This needs to be addressed and we need to say to developers that if they are to continue to make the money they are now making, they must pay their due back to society.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I thank Senator Cox for sharing her time. We are not taking enough interest in the social consequences of one-off housing and ribbon development outside towns. Such developments are fine when those who buy the houses in question are young, but as they get older the consequences of their being far from shops, churches, etc., can be very serious. They become totally reliant on cars. This should be factored in when planning permission is being granted.Developers still seem to be getting away with building more houses on a site than are allowed under the planning permission. I have recently received two such complaints, one pertaining to a development in County Wexford and the other to a development in County Kildare. In the case in County Kildare, it was only discovered that the detached houses in question were on smaller sites than they should have been on when there was a problem with the sewerage system. I would like to feel sure that the greatest possible care is taken to ensure developers comply with the planning permissions they are given.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I, too, thank Senator Cox for sharing her time. I agree with much of what has been said, particular by Senator Henry. The building, buying and selling of property comprise a big jungle of which people have a pretty ropy understanding. The system seems to suit the developers, sellers, landowners and everybody except the first-time buyer or the person who actually needs a house in which to live. It would be preferable if it suited the latter.The odds in this jungle are stacked very heavily not just against the first-time buyer but also against the person buying a home in which to live. I do not want to lay all the blame on the Government for the young first-time buyer not always being able to buy a property but there are circumstances in which it is obviously fair that the Government interfere in what is known as the free market. There are social circumstances in which this applies and it certainly applies in the case in question.Young people are finding it impossible to get on the housing ladder. The average first-time buyer's house in Dublin costs approximately €350,000, which is a very high price and unaffordable to someone earning an average income. There are ways of tackling this issue. It can be done on the supply side and the Government has had a go in this regard. It is not a matter of reducing stamp duty, as Senator Cox said. There is a bit of a myth about stamp duty as it is not a tax on the buyer but on the seller — nobody quite realises this. The former Minister for Finance was in full agreement with me in this regard, as he stated in this House not very long ago.Let me explain what I mean. If one buys a house and pays 6% or 7% of the cost as stamp duty, or 9% if one pays at the top rate, one must have the money to do so. One must have borrowed it or acquired it somehow and have it in one's back pocket. If there were no stamp duty, one would pay the same price for a house because the price would simply increase accordingly. The buyer, who would have the money to pay if there were stamp duty, would be prepared to pay the same amount if there were none. It does not matter to the buyer whether the money is spent on stamp duty or on the house and therefore the person who is actually getting less from this system is the seller. Stamp duty is therefore a tax on the seller although it does not appear to be so.What can the Government do to reduce prices? It is a very difficult question because there is a kind of conspiracy against the first-time buyer. It is not just the establishment that is involved — also included are auctioneers who conspire against the first-time buyer and enter a cabal to ensure that nothing works in his or her favour, as Senator Bradford stated. The banks are also involved because they are lending money recklessly, thus increasing the price of houses. They do not care about the consequences for the buyer. They are lending recklessly in a period of very low interest rates. This is fine if one wants to borrow a lot of money at present but it will be bloody murder when interest rates increase suddenly. I am not referring to the gradual increases which I suspect will occur next month or next year. When they increase suddenly, first-time buyers who have managed somehow to get on the property ladder by paying extraordinarily high prices will find they are being crucified by the same banks that have been so generous to them in the past. The consequence of this will almost certainly be a fall in the property market. The only question, as the economists' conference identified this week, will be whether the fall will result in a soft or hard landing. The social consequences will be such that houses will come on the market because people will not be able to pay for them, and there will be negative equity.The market is now a fairly depressing place for potential buyers and may prove to be such for those who have bought in recent times by borrowing very large sums of money. I would like to hear the Minister of State's response.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I thank the Members for their contributions. This is a time of enormous and unprecedented change in the housing sector. In that context, the Government has set very ambitious goals and is delivering. To realise the changes that have taken place, one has only to look at the results of the last census, which indicate that the population increased by approximately 8% in a six-year period. The number of people between 25 and 34 increased by 18%. People in this age group are the ones who are buying houses and forming new families and relationships. The statistics demonstrate the pressure on the market but we are meeting the demand and providing record levels of housing. Investments of record levels have been made in the social and affordable housing sectors.It is not just a matter of numbers as the quality of the houses developed is very high. As I stated previously, one third of the housing stock is very new, having been built in the past ten years. Not only are resources being ploughed into the construction of new houses but they are also being ploughed into older estates under the remedial works scheme. Some €35 million per year is allocated in this regard, and the investment in regeneration programmes amounts to approximately €130 million per year. Ballymun, Dublin's inner city, parts of Cork and Limerick and elsewhere have benefited in this regard. We started the central heating programme last year because approximately 45,000 local authority houses had no central heating. We are providing new houses and upgrading the existing stock.The allocations in last year's and this year's housing budget amount to €2 billion. I heard Senator Ulick Burke state there is a delay every year in respect of the local authorities getting their allocations. However, we have agreed five-year action plans with the local authorities and they can fast-track them if they like. They do not have to wait until March, April or May in any year for their allocation because we have made a five-year deal with them involving five-year capital envelopes. They can get on with business and therefore the excuse of there being delays has worn out.Part V has been mentioned. Its provisions have been slow to come on-stream but will be very important. Part V is delivering and will be a considerable source of social and affordable houses. I have heard different views on it in recent times but, regardless of these, it will be very relevant and successful.Senator Moylan spoke about the sale scheme and said that if a site in a rural area has been provided to the local authority for a house and that house is being sold 30 years later, it is not fair of the local authority to charge the full, open market price. If that is happening in Offaly or anywhere else, the local authority is wrong. The rules and guidelines from the Department are clear. If a site is given or sold cheaply to the local authority, when the house is bought out later the person must get a considerable discount. The calculation should be based on the house minus the price of the site. If any local authority is not adhering to the rules, it should be pulled up for it.The assessment of needs was mentioned. We carried out an assessment of needs some months ago but the figures are not yet ready. It is an extraordinarily tortuous job in conjunction with the local authorities but the figures will be released in the coming months. Regardless of what the figures are, everybody is aware that some people are on the local authority waiting lists in the hope that the ideal house will become available for them. There is want and there is need. Everybody on the local authority waiting list is not in immediate need. Most of them are living with families and there are 60,000 living in the best of accommodation on rent allowance. It is not the case that their lives are on hold if they do not get the ideal house.There was reference to the income limits for affordable housing. There are a couple of affordable housing schemes and the Affordable Homes Partnership is driving this process in the Dublin area. The overall income limits for the earlier schemes were adjusted in the summer of last year. We are working on these and expect to increase the figures again in the next few weeks. However, if the income and loan limits are increased too much, one ends up catering for a different cohort of people and forgetting the people at the bottom who need help as well. We must be mindful of the category of people we are trying to help.I do not have time to answer all the points raised. Broadly, however, we are doing a considerable amount of work. A sum of €2 billion is being spent per year on the housing budget alone. That is a fact. Members might rubbish that fact and say we can do more because there are still people on the lists. Of course, there are and we are doing our best to help them. The simple statistic is that we are spending €2 billion per year on social and affordable housing. Our record is a successful one. We are not getting complacent or suggesting there is nobody waiting for housing. We are aware of the realities. The issue is to continue what we are doing and to seek more finance to solve the problems of people who need housing, to upgrade the housing stock and make them sustainable and to make the communities that live in them more sustainable. Given the level of resources being made available, we will have further success in coming years.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I move:That Seanad Éireann concerned at the progress of the war in Iraq, and in light of recent revelations and admissions by the United States authorities:—condemns the use of chemical agents such as white phosphorus, MK77, by US forces;—expresses its revulsion at the discovery of 170 persons apparently victims of torture in the basement of the Iraqi Interior Ministry;—calls upon the Irish Government to review its policy on the use of Shannon Airport and to make a definite and credible statement concerning the nature of this traffic, in particular, the use of the airport by the Gulfstream Five jet aircraft which has been implicated in the policy of extraordinary rendition;—calls for restrictions on the international media in the reporting of the Iraqi war to be lifted and for full access to be granted to international agencies such as the Red Cross, Red Crescent, etc., in order to allow them to assess the impact of military operations on the civilian population of Iraq; and—calls for the establishment of an international inquiry into the attack on Falluja.I do not envy the Minister his position of having to defend an indefensible Government amendment. The reason I will oppose it so vigorously is that my motion was intended to cause discomfort to the American regime in its criminal activities. The Government's amendment is anodyne; it is an attempt to soothe the discomfort. I agree with the Dalai Lama that even though there is a great disparity between the size of a flea and that of a human, it is sometimes good to be the flea in the bed that keeps people awake and awakens their conscience.It is becoming clear now that, despite President Bush's vainglorious boasts during an electioneering stunt on board the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln on 2 May 2003 in front of a banner proclaiming “Mission Accomplished”, American and British troops have not prevailed in Iraq. The truth is as a correspondent in the British newspaper The Independent wrote on Monday this week: “The endgame in Iraq is nigh.” Some of us foresaw this. I was not alone in predicting that the Iraqi adventure would end in tears. Militarily, I believe the war is in the process of being comprehensively lost despite whatever face saving spin is put upon it. I take no pleasure in this for, unlike Bush and Blair, I do not gloat in death — the death of Iraqi civilians, the so-called insurgents or, indeed, the unfortunate and misled coalition troops.However, there is still time to rescue something vital from the debacle. I refer to those standards of decency and humanity that underpin the fragile moral order of the world and the two words that have been so violently misused by Bush and Blair, "democracy" and "Christianity".It is now a clearly established fact that the assault on Iraq was planned well before the attack on the World Trade Centre. The events of 9 September 2001 merely provided a convenient catalyst which could be supported by a tissue of lies about weapons of mass destruction and posturing about an interest in humanitarian issues. Indeed, the media driven emphasis on the al-Qaeda inspired attack on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon failed to put this in the perspective of the activities of Western countries, led by the United States in South America where death squads and torture were orchestrated by US operatives and in Asia where the wholesale employment of the chemical warfare weapon Agent Orange and napalm led to the annihilation of hundreds of thousands of neutral civilians in places such as Vietnam and Kampuchea.Did they think it would never come home to roost? Despite the appalling nature of the carnage in New York and Washington and the tragedy and horror visited upon the innocent victims, to whom my heart goes out, the number of casualties was but a pinprick compared with what has been done to the subjugated people of this planet in the name of the West. If the disaster of the war in Iraq can be said to have any positive aspect it is that it must force us to reassess and reassert our values in the face of those wicked leaders who have deliberately subverted them.It is ironic that last Sunday marked the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Nuremberg war crimes trials. The US played a righteous and leading role in this, contrasting dramatically with its current attempts to evade the remit of the newly-established International Criminal Court. We are repeatedly told that this war is being fought in the interests of Western values. My values as a Westerner do not include the waging of aggressive warfare, the wholesale use of torture, the bombing of civilian targets and the use of chemical weapons.We had many warning signals that we were on a moral slide, and some of us tried to speak out but we were not heeded. We witnessed the systematic undermining of the United Nations, the decrying of the Geneva Convention, the targeting of the independent news agencies — particularly troubling are yesterday's reports that Tony Blair had to fight hard to dissuade President Bush from bombing the al-Jazeera studios in Qatar — the killing of journalists, the embedding of reporters with armed forces to prevent independent reporting, and the defence of the use of torture, at first insidious and anonymous but now reaching to the very top through the discredited agencies of the law, right up to the leaders of the Untied States and Britain. All this has been accomplished to the accompaniment of a cynical abuse of language the like of which has not been seen since the Third Reich. I could give many examples of that but I will give only two. Extraordinary rendition, the euphemism to cover the kidnapping of individuals and the illegal transfer of persons to third states for the purpose of torture and interrogation, and the appalling concept of targeting human beings with chemical weapons such as white phosphorous, a corrosive substance that burns through the human flesh to the bone, in an operation described as "shake and bake".Nor will I be intimidated by those who would accuse me of being anti-American. In this morass the best friend America has is the person who will them the truth to their face and among those I number a former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, who stated:In recent years I have become increasingly concerned by a host of radical Government policies that now threaten many basic principles espoused by all previous administrations, Democratic and Republican. These include the rudimentary American commitment to peace, economic and social justice, civil liberties, our environment and human rights. Also endangered are our historic commitment to providing citizens with truthful information ...In this article entitled "This is not the country that I once knew", recently commissioned and published by the Los Angeles Times, President Carter continued:Of even greater concern is that the US has repudiated the Geneva Accords and supported the use of torture in Iraq, Afghanistan, Quantanamo and secretly through proxy regimes else where with the so called Extraordinary Rendition programme. It is embarrassing to see the President and Vice President insisting that the CIA should be free to perpetrate "cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment" on people in US custody.In light of these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the trial of Saddam Hussein can proceed. He is charged with waging aggressive war, using chemical weapons, involvement in torture and other human rights abuses. This is an exact description of what the United States and Britain have done in Iraq. How can they possibly be taken seriously when they accuse another of those crimes of which they themselves are guilty? This is just one of the ironies with which this situation is replete. The tyrannical monster, Saddam Hussein, may ultimately escape justice because of the moral bankruptcy of those forces led by Bush and Blair.Iraq under Saddam Hussein was a tyranny but it was functional. It was held together by a central authority. It now looks as if the outcome of the west's intervention will be to leave behind a fragmented and shattered society dominated by a religious clique whose strings are pulled from Teheran. Meanwhile, the people suffer ever more intensely. One hundred thousand civilians have been killed, according to figures published by the Lancet, which the British and American Governments dishonestly tried to undermine. The provision of electricity and sewerage services are worse than it was under Saddam, and the people are subject to terror not just from the allies but from roving bands of militia and death squads. It is a comprehensive reign of terror.I want to examine the question of the use of chemical weapons, which is a contentious issue. What is referred to here is a new generation of incendiary weapons code named MK77. These are the linear descendants of weapons widely used in Korea and later in Vietnam. Their use was denied last June in response to a question in the House of Commons by Mr. Adam Ingram, Defence Minister. However, later Mr. Ingram was forced to admit to Labour MP Harry Cohen that he had misled Parliament because he had been lied to by the US. He told Mr. Cohen:The US confirmed to my officials that they had not used MK77s in Iraq at any time and this was the basis of my response to you. I regret to say that I have since discovered that this is not the case and must now correct the position.I spoke last weekend to Mr. Cohen in Edinburgh and he confirmed these facts.In light of this and the American doctrine of plausible deniability, why should the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Foreign Affairs believe, for example, the denial concerning the Gulfstream V jet given by unnamed officials of unknown rank within the Bush Administration. I have since spoken to our Foreign Minister. It was not even at that level. It was junior officials in the American Embassy in Dublin.The 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons appears to permit the use of this kind of material but only for illumination purposes and only against military targets. MK77 is a napalm canister munition. The containers lack stabilising fins and consequently acquire a tumbling motion on being dropped that contributes to the scattering of the combustible gel over a wide area. Its use is a violation of the Geneva Protocol Against the Use of White Phosphorus "since its use causes indiscriminate and extreme injuries especially when deployed in an urban area". The effect of this material was certainly known to the United States army before its use. The Marine Corps Gazette, an official organ of the American army, contains the following description of so-called thermobaric or fuel air weapons:Such weapons on ignition form a cloud of violent gases or finely powdered explosives. This cloud is then ignited and the subsequent fireball sears the surrounding area while consuming the oxygen in this area. The lack of oxygen creates an enormous overpressure. Persons under the cloud are literally crushed to death. Outside the cloud area the blast wave travels at some 3,000 metres per second. As a result a fuel-air explosive can have the effect of a tactical nuclear weapon without residual radiation. Those personnel caught directly under the aerosol cloud will die from the flame or overpressure. For those on the periphery of the strike, the injuries can be severe. Burns, broken bones, contusions from flying debris and blindness may result. Furthermore, the crushing injuries from the overpressure can create air embolisms within blood vessels, concussions, multiple internal haemorrhages in the liver and spleen, collapsed lungs, rupture of the eardrums and displacement of the eyes from their sockets.This is the material that was used in Falluja. There is no doubt that it caused a holocaust. I would put those who deny it in the same category as those who denied the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews.It must be remembered that the United States and British Governments have steadfastly refused to keep or release statistics concerning the number of civilian casualties. Indeed, in December 2003, the Iraqi health Minister, under pressure from Washington and London, ordered a halt to the count of civilians killed during the war. Moreover, when United States soldiers stormed Falluja their first action was to seize the general hospital and arrest the doctors. The New York Times reported: “The hospital was selected as an early target because the American military believed that it was a source of rumours about heavy casualties”.Were civilians killed in addition to military personnel? We know that before attacking the city the Marines stopped men of fighting age from leaving. They were categorised according to age, not according to military occupation. In addition, many women and children stayed. A correspondent with The Guardian, for example, estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians were left.In the March 2005 edition of the American army magazine,  Field Artillery, officers from the second infantry fire support element boast about their attack on Falluja. It states:White Phosphorus. WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breaches and later in the fight as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes where we could not get effects on them with high explosive. We fired "Shake and Bake" missions at the insurgents using White Phosphorus to flush them out and high explosive to take them out.There is a further eye witness account by an embedded reporter, published in California's North County Times, which confirms the matter. I note in that account the use of the phrase “insurgents”. Who are these insurgents? I will give an example of the way this phrase is used.On 16 October 2005, a group of adults and children gathered around a burnt out American vehicle on the edge of the city of Ramadi. There was some horse-play from the children. The group was attacked by a US F15 fighter jet. Subsequently, the US military released a report saying it had killed 70 insurgents and knew of no civilian deaths. Among the "insurgents" killed were six year old Mohammad Salih Ali, who was buried in a plastic bag after relatives collected what they believed to be parts of his body, and four year old Saad Ahmed Fuad and his eight year old sister, Haifa, who had to buried without one of her legs as her family were unable to find it. It is very necessary although harrowing to put human faces on these victims, so easily dismissed as insurgents. It is also useful to remind ourselves that according to a 1978 United Nations General Assembly resolution, armed resistance in the case of occupation is legitimate. So insurgency is legitimate but what about the murder of children? Is that legitimate?We have, in addition, accounts from an embedded reporter, Darrin Mortenson, describing the firing of "round after round of high explosives and white phosphorus charges into the city of Fallujah Friday and Saturday never knowing what the targets were or what damage the resulting explosions caused". Another reporter, Dahr Jamail, reports speaking to a doctor who had remained in the city of Falluja and encountered numerous reports of civilians suffering unusual burns. One surviving resident of Falluja described "weird bombs which put up smoke like a mushroom cloud" and described watching "pieces of these bombs explode into large fires that continue to burn on the skin even after people dump water on the burn". A physician at a local hospital said that the corpses being brought in were "burnt and some corpses were melted". Further eye witness accounts include that of Jeff Englehart, a former marine, who spent two days in Falluja during the battle. He has since said in an interview:I heard the order to pay attention because they were going to use white phosphorous on Falluja. In military jargon it is known as Whiskey Pete. Phosphorous burns the body; in fact, it melts the flesh all the way down to the bone. I saw the burnt bodies of women and children.Moreover, even if one accepts an argument on technical and legal bases for the use of white phosphorous as an illumination, the United States army's own regulations, as contained in the US Army and General College Staff Battle Book indicates that its use as described above is illegal. Burster-type white phosphorous rounds burn with intense heat and emit dense white smoke. They may be used as the initial rounds in a smoke screen to rapidly create smoke, or against material targets such as class five sites or logistics sites. It is against the law of the land, however, to employ white phosphorous against personnel targets. Many of us were already worried about the use of cluster bombs, which particularly target children, and depleted uranium with its consequent impact on civilian health.With regard to torture, there has been a consistent attempt by the United States Government and its agents to legitimise the use of torture in a manner that has completely shocked most European nations. An enormous number of people have been arbitrarily detained. A Pentagon report released in the last week reveals that 13,814 persons are held in United States custody in Iraq out of a total of more than 80,000 detained in facilities there and in Afghanistan and Cuba since September 11 2001.One of the major problems in Iraq is that the coalition forces have largely abdicated the responsibility for policing in favour of local sectarian militias. The result has been the emergence of death squads and the phenomenon of disappearances. There have been repeated unsuccessful attempts to persuade the allies to investigate the persistent stories of torture being carried out under the aegis of the Minister of the Interior.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	173	It is an honour to second the motion. When I supported Senator Norris's recent call on the Order of Business for a debate on the situation in Iraq, I reminded the House of the iconic photographs of children in Vietnam burnt with white phosphorous and trying to flee. It was impossible for them to escape it, however, because this substance sticks to the skin. The world was appalled by those photographs. To see the United States army using such a weapon again in areas where there are civilians is dreadful. It is important to say that none of us believe the entire United States population supports such action. During a recent visit to Washington, I found that most people, many of them Republicans, are shocked at what is happening.The use of this agent is dreadful. Senator Norris has spoken in some detail about its effects and the illegality of its use. The inhalation of the smoke, from which people cannot escape, causes immediate scarring of the lungs and subsequent suffocation. The medical description tells us that the body is burned from the inside out. Persons who are struck by the smoke from white phosphorous are burned almost immediately and the effect is as bad as, if not worse than, that of napalm. The smoke affects not only the skin but also penetrates the subcutaneous tissues where it causes the person to be burned to the bone. Sometimes, extraordinarily, the clothes of the victim are left intact because they are not necessarily set on fire by the phosphorous.The March 2005 edition of Field Artillery describes how white phosphorous was used in what were the unfortunately named “shake and bake” missions to flush out insurgents. No consideration was given, however, to the so-called collateral damage done to civilians. Senator Norris has vividly described what doctors in Falluja saw of those civilians burnt by white phosphorous. Another attractive ingredient is now being added to these canisters in the “shake and bake” bombings. The addition of polystyrene pellets ensures there is better adherence to the victim’s flesh. It is impossible to remove them and prevent further burn damage. This is a new innovation.Reports from Iraq in the United States media give little idea of how life goes on there because many reporters are embedded with the military. I found it particularly sad in Washington to find no reports in the newspapers or on television about what is happening. There is nothing like the coverage we receive in this country. There were some reports on public service radio but that is listened to by less than 10% of the population. There is an extraordinary dearth of information in that country. If any of us ask our interns what they know about Iraq and what they have discovered since they came here, I am sure they will agree with what I have said.Nor is the situation for the civilian population being explained, quite apart from what is happening with the military. Some of the best of the services in the Middle East were those in Iraq, particularly prior to the imposition of UN sanctions. Saddam Hussein was a dreadful man but his people enjoyed a health service better than that in Saudi Arabia, for all its petrol dollars. This is evident from an examination of Iraq's maternal and infant mortality figures and the subsequent slide since the early 1990s. Its people must contend with a far worse situation since the occupation.Under the Geneva Convention, occupying forces are supposed to protect the civilian population. The United States Attorney General, Mr. Alberto Gonzales, has described the provisions of the convention as "quaint", an unfortunate description for the United States military who must go and fight there. If one does not intend to abide by the Geneva Convention, one cannot expect the opposition to give the benefits of that international protocol to one's own army.Going through Shannon Airport on several occasions recently, I looked with dismay at the unfortunate United States soldiers returning to Iraq. They all seemed to have been home for just 15 days. Some 40% of those National Guard members on duty in Iraq never expected to serve in foreign conflicts. A large number of them are college students who joined the military in order to get their fees paid and receive other supports in their study efforts. These are the people being put to war at the command of those very wicked people in Washington. As I observed them at Shannon, I realised that five of them would be killed each day. By the time I had returned from the United States, a considerable number of them would have been dead.Senator Norris spoke about the shocking outing to Falluja. The civilians who tried to get out succeeded in doing so. Men of military age were stopped and sent back, as has happened in other towns. Those who are old, infirm, pregnant or ill, however, cannot flee and it was their bodies that were found. People with diabetes and other chronic illnesses cannot flee. Large numbers of the population cannot do so. We have seen no photographs of the tent cities now in place outside Falluja because the building is proceeding at an extraordinarily slow pace.On 23 June 2004, during the Report Stage debate on the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Bill 2003, I said to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform:I wish to raise with the Minister a matter which has been of great concern to the House. Can he assure us that untried and unsentenced people are not being brought through Shannon from goodness knows where to Guantanamo Bay? We raised this issue in the House several times ... and it has been a cause of real concern to us because many Irish citizens would not like to think that was happening.The Minister said in his reply:Obviously, I have no notice of that issue, although, apparently, the Senator has raised it on other occasions in the House. Any person who is on the soil of Ireland is entitled to the protection of our Constitution. No person can be brought through the soil of Ireland in the custody of any other state except in accordance with international law. If the Senator has reason to believe any person has been transited through Irish territory, in unlawful custody, particularly to Quantanamo, I would be interested to hear it because I would respond to it immediately. We have our Constitution and the right of the freedom of the individual is not confined to citizens; it applies to all persons. Therefore, it would cause me grave concern if I thought people were being smuggled through Irish territory in circumstances that amounted to unlawful detention in Irish law or in international law for that matter.We have not made half enough effort to try to find out what is happening on those aeroplanes.

It is important that we address the matter of American troops in Shannon.

I do not know whether there is a connection between the two.We have seen fit to table a very long amendment to this motion. There is probably an esoteric political reason for this that escapes me as the motion is clear and apposite. It is not US-bashing, rather an important motion. It arose at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. Members of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and the Independents were there and no one had any difficulty with it, nor do I. I am very fond of the United States of America as it is a wonderful country. I even like its President, Mr. George W. Bush, although some people do not. This does not mean that I cannot criticise that country at any stage. I do not agree with everything America or President Bush do.If I have a good friend and he is guilty of a moral transgression, I surely have the right to remonstrate with him and still retain his friendship. Otherwise, he is not worth having as a friend in the first place. America's case is the same. It is a wonderful country but, in recent times, human rights have been overridden. There is no other way of putting it. US forces have used chemical weapons against civilians, which is appalling. It is a serious issue and I congratulate Senator Norris, his colleagues and supporters for moving this motion. One can pass and agree a motion such as this but does not need to disagree with America as a country, people or anything else. When we see wrong, we must stand up and say so, which is what the Senators are doing tonight. I cannot speak for Senator Norris but I believe this is what he is saying. When he speaks he is generally sincere and I believe this is a sincere attempt to criticise something being done by what in many ways is a great country as there are, or were, great freedoms there. It saddens me that we must make this criticism.Senator Henry mentioned Guantanamo Bay. The United Nations inspectorate will not be allowed to interview prisoners there on a one-to-one basis. We have spoken about the bay before. It is an appalling place. Can we imagine being taken from the wilds of Afghanistan, put in orange suits in our bare feet with something in our ears, mouths and eyes, placed on our hunkers and kept there? In my book, this is torture. I cannot think of any other word for it.I can appreciate the American point of view. Never before in the history of America did people fly planes into buildings and kill 3,000 people in one go. The US will not relent in its pursuit of terrorism, which I applaud. I also applaud the toppling of Saddam Hussein. It could have been possible to do so in a different way but the war was started and is continuing. It horrifies me that soldiers will be blamed for incidents such as this but they generally only do what they are ordered or permitted to do.

#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	185	If a blind eye is turned, it is a general who does so. Generals really only do what they are permitted by politicians. Blame should sit where it must, namely, with the people who give the instructions. America's Commander-in-Chief and Secretary of State for Defence are very strong and powerful roles. If one were to examine any army throughout history one would find very few mutinies. Soldiers generally obey orders and do not act on their own. However, I am not so naive as to believe that, in a war situation, soldiers do not sometimes carry out actions they should not.Young men from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Texas, Idaho and so on are frightened in Iraq. It is a shocking and incredible statistic that one US soldier loses a limb every four hours. A total of 100,000 Iraqis are dead and the country is in chaos despite elections and what they are trying to do. I do not wish to take away from this in any sense as the West must try to help Iraq establish a democracy according to its principles and ways, not ours. It must be given the freedom to do so. It has been rid of a tyrant but he should not be replaced by another tyrannical regime.The problem for the US in Iraq is that the situation is almost another Vietnam. I visited Vietnam a number of years ago and spoke with many Vietnamese who do not call it the Vietnamese War but the American War. Approximately 3 million Vietnamese and 66,000 Americans were killed. The figures were so great it does not matter. One incident saw Hue, a beautiful city that is now a UNESCO site, being taken on General William Westmoreland's order. Inside a week, 10,000 civilians were killed for nothing as today, the city is doing business with America, the state is communist but one can still practice religion and so on.The same is happening in Iraq. It is difficult not to have atrocities in a conventional war but we must never be afraid to speak out against them when we see them. I applaud Senator Norris and the Members who support him for doing so. I am afraid that the American forces will have trouble in this struggle, which is turning into a guerrilla war. The only way to win this type of war is with a massive sweep of men and resources, which the US does not have at present. The danger could spread into other countries, such as Iran and neighbouring states.We can support a motion such as this. I welcome that the amendment states it condemns the use of violence against civilians and chemical weapons in Iraq, although it does not say who uses them. We are using the phrase "Irish airport to transit prisoners for rendition purposes". "Rendition" is a great word but what does it mean? Does it mean torture? It should not be in the amendment. However, I support the amendment because I am supposed to but it goes against the grain. The motion is good and does not bash America but merely states a fact. In our country and our democracy we should be entitled to condemn this outrageous use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I am disappointed that the Government has seen fit to table an amendment to the motion in the name of Senator Norris and his colleagues as the wording of the motion is very balanced. More importantly, its unanimous approval by the House would give us a moral standpoint as to our position on the conduct of the Iraqi war.There were quite a number of debates in the House during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq and since then on the subject of the politics of the war, the politics of the invasion, its purpose and what would flow from it. Many of us differed in that broad debate but the House should now be in a position to fully unite behind this motion and its absolute and proper condemnation of the use of chemical weapons and our revulsion at the practice of torture in Iraq.I was interested to hear Senator Norris quote former President Jimmy Carter to whom I have often referred. It is commonly agreed that he is without doubt the outstanding ex-President of the United States. Since he ceased being President in 1980 he has done outstanding humanitarian work. I read his recent comments not just on the current situation in Iraq but on the broader state of current American political and military thinking. He paints a very depressing and worrying picture as to where America stands on a broad range of issues.When people speak of President Bush, they often refer to his apparent strong moral convictions which I do not deny he holds. However, former President Carter also held and holds very strong moral convictions. His autobiography called Keeping Faith is more a diary of his four years in office. It shows the lengths to which he would always go to ensure that a political decision was underpinned by clear, moral thinking. Coming from that background of strong personal morality, he has serious concerns about what America is doing not just in Iraq but in other parts of the world. We should give serious consideration to his views.The use of chemical weapons is indefensible. It is the ultimate irony that one of the supposed purposes of the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein was to ensure that chemical weapons would not be used against Americans and other people. However, chemical weapons or chemical agents, or whatever the correct scientific title is, are now being used.The use of white phosphorus is a chilling and horrific way of conducting warfare. Senators Norris and Henry have outlined in graphic detail the physical impact of that weapon or chemical agent. The House cannot but support what the Senators have said. Both this House and the Government must be very strong in condemning its use and make strong representations directly to the United States authorities to express our opposition to this activity. The issue should also be raised at European and United Nations levels.We must be equally strong on the issue of torture. Even the strongest opponents of the war in Iraq would have conceded the widespread use of torture under the regime of Saddam Hussein but it is immoral to replace one regime of terror with another. The full facts of the case referred to in the motion are not clear nor are the facts relating to the use of torture on Iraqi prisoners but the discovery of 170 persons in a basement requires immediate investigation and we need to know the facts.The strength of the United States down the years has been that it showed a high moral purpose. Its finest hours were in coming to the aid of Europe during the First and Second World Wars and coming to the aid of Europe in assisting the ending of the Cold War and the unifying of the continent. All its finest moments came when it acted with clear moral authority. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about its activities in Iraq. The United States is devaluing itself in the manner in which it has conducted its activities in Iraq.The House debated and divided on the issue of the invasion of Iraq but to make matters worse, what has happened since the invasion presents a very negative view of the United States. As a result, we are all reduced and the United States itself is reduced. We must be very clear in making our feelings known. As Senator Lydon stated and as Senator Norris said on many occasions, highlighting these issues is not damaging in any way to the relationship that exists between the United States and the Irish Republic. We are duty bound as a people very closely connected to the United States to highlight where it is going wrong and it appears to be going spectacularly wrong in Iraq.I support what has been said about the reporting of the war. Senator Henry referred to the lack of coverage of the Iraq war in the United States. It is a given that television and radio in the United States is so commercialised and so geared towards a commercial pop agenda that current affairs are never a number one on the best sellers charts. It is disappointing and it should be noted that there appears to be a deliberate effort to ensure that the war in Iraq and its profound failures to date are not receiving in the United States the media attention or debate they deserve.I note the Government amendment, parts of which I agree with. We welcome the referendum and the Security Council resolution and we hope they will in some small way lead to progress. However, the issue is for this House of the Oireachtas to be clear and unanimous in its condemnation of the use of chemical agents and weaponry. We must clearly demonstrate our most strident opposition to the use of torture, whether in Iraq, Guantanamo Bay or elsewhere. We must state loud and clear that these activities have no place in a civilised world and should not be practised in any form by a country such as the United States which for generations was the leading voice of human rights but now, sadly, is reducing and devaluing itself by the carrying out of these activities and these atrocities.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. In preparing for this debate, I undertook an exercise which has served me well on previous occasions. I rigorously examined all my previous contributions in the House on the topic of Iraq and in light of current events. That re-examination led me to an uncomfortable weekend as long-cherished assumptions about the war in Iraq were placed under the spotlight and if not found wanting were at least found to be overoptimistic, which is an understandable human failing.Just 12 days ago, many in this country remembered the armistice of 87 years ago which ended the Great War, a war that participants believed would be over by Christmas, and would end all wars. Alas, seldom can one predict the course that conflicts will take. Helmut von Moltke once said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but it is obvious now that the rapid defeat of Saddam Hussein's regime was not the Godsend that many people hoped it would be, myself included, but was a precursor to a bitter struggle for democracy.My own words of 21 March 2003 resonate strongly today. I stated:"In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, all are losers." So said Neville Chamberlain in 1938. As a former United Nations peacekeeper, I can only concur with those sentiments. War and its aftermath are never pleasant. Death, destruction and destitution are the inevitable lot of the so-called losing side. War, terrorism, genocide, mass murder and injustice are all evil. All are human acts, committed by mankind. We live in an imperfect world run by imperfect people making imperfect decisions.I repeat these words not in a sense of vindication but rather with a sense of sadness that these things have come to pass and that ordinary Iraqi citizens have suffered and continue to suffer today. I also repeat these words and speak of the suffering of the Iraqi people because the motion put forward by Senators Norris, Henry and O'Toole, while well meaning, suggests little to ease those sufferings. Condemnations of the use of phosphorus and torture apart, it should be calling on the Government to do all that it can in support of United Nations Resolution 1637 and to remind Britain and the United States of their international obligations to help rebuild Iraq's shattered society.Since joining the United Nations in December 1955, this country has endeavoured to uphold the ethos and support the work of that organisation. I cannot imagine this House, this Government or the Irish people turning their backs on the UN when it calls on, "the international community... to support the Iraqi people in their pursuit of peace, stability, security, democracy, and prosperity".While we are a small country, we have a distinct voice in the world and have taken a position of leadership in areas like human rights, conflict resolution and peacekeeping. To close Shannon Airport, or indeed Irish airspace, to United States military flights would do little to help the human rights of ordinary Iraqi citizens. It would do little to resolve conflict and bring peace to that far-off land. In effect, it would be an abdication of the role we have played for the past 50 years, a role that has seen us give assistance to whomever has desired it, regardless of colour or creed.

I wish to quote from Senator McCain, who is far more eloquent on the subject of terrorism and torture than I could ever be:The enemy we fight has no respect for human life or human rights. They do not deserve our sympathy. But this is not about who they are. This is about who we are. These are the values that distinguish us from our enemies, and we can never, never allow our enemies to take those values away.Turning again to Iraq itself and the use of phosphorus and the discovery of tortured detainees in an Iraqi Interior ministry building, the use of extemporised phosphorus munitions against insurgent units in civilian areas of Falluja must be condemned out of hand, as should the detention in the Iraqi Interior ministry building some 170 Sunni detainees. However, we must retain our focus. There is a growing campaign in Britain and the United States to bring home the troops. Despite daily bombings aimed at inciting civil war, discouraging Iraqis from joining the security forces and stifling the political process, the insurgents have not won. To prematurely bring home troops would be to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

I have often stood here before or after Senator Minihan, and we have both, in unequivocal terms believed in the value of condemnation. This is the belief that it is important that small countries take a position based on morality. As I understand Senator Lydon's honourable position on the issue over a period of time I will restrain myself in that respect. This is a serious issue, and I wish the Minister of State had even an inkling in realising that we are talking about the murder of innocent children by somebody that this Government calls a friend. I would appreciate if he removed the grin from his face and showed some indication that he is taking the matter seriously.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I would appreciate if he gave the indication that the issue was serious.Effectively, control of Iraq has been handed over to a Shi'ite militia in Shi'ite areas, to a nominal Iraqi army under the control of many of the militias fighting the insurgency and to a Kurdish army in the areas of Iraq which have a Kurdish majority. It is impossible to see the purpose served by the forces of occupation other than hiding the political embarrassment of the President of the United States. Iraq is not under the control of its own government, it is not under the control of the occupying forces and it is instead under the control of three different ethnic or sectarian groups — the Shi'ites, the Sunnis and the Kurds.The role of the United States is to hold on to some semblance of public credibility in a position where it has no real influence. Of course there were elections and a referendum, and there will be more elections. The three sectarian groups, for reasons of their own, want them. The Shia militias and the Kurds will ensure that people can vote during a referendum while, yet again, the Sunni provinces will have a low — close to zero — turnout. This has happened repeatedly. It gives the semblance of democracy because it suits to do so. However, when I hear competent journalists say that women are being shot in Shia areas because they are not wearing appropriate dress and that there is no Western journalist able to go anywhere outside a couple of areas surrounded by American troops — when I know all that — I know we are living in an world of illusion.I wish to refer to extraordinary rendition. Whatever I might think of the present US regime, the US is and ought to be a symbol of the best of what the world should hope for in terms of freedom and democracy. The problem with war, terrorism and the wrong response to the terrorism is that they insulate or anaesthetise us against any sense of morality. That is what this motion is concerned with and why the amendment is so unsuitable. George W. Bush could vote for the amendment without any problem. Tony Blair would vote for it enthusiastically — he might even toughen it up a bit, because he thinks everybody else is bound by a morality that he does not have to address. Tony Blair will not even say how many civilians his Government believes have been killed in Iraq since the invasion. Apparently, they do not count.Every one of the innocent civilians killed by terrorists counts. If one wants to take the position that we are concerned about attacks on innocent civilians, then all innocent civilians count: the innocent civilians shaked and baked by high explosive and phosphorous; those left in the wake of murderous attacks such as that on Falluja; those bombed at a marketplace in Baghdad during the war, when we never heard the outcome other than through an attempt to defame one of the best and bravest journalists writing in the Western media, Robert Fisk; those killed when a wedding party was attacked; or those killed last week when understandably terrified young American soldiers opened fire on a car.All of those innocent civilians are equally as innocent as the unfortunate people bombed on the London Underground. That is why this issue is so serious. It is not about George Bush's politics. It is about whether this country, having lived through and learned of the contaminating, corrupting nature of the belief that civilians are legitimate targets, is now walking away from a position just because our friends in Washington would be upset. That is the real debate around this issue: the fact that we do not want to upset those friends in Washington. How far do they have to go before the Irish Government will say that something is unequivocally wrong?Some 20 years ago, when Ronald Reagan was exercising himself in Central America, Irish Governments were prepared to say that what was being done was wrong and immoral, and they took the side of the people who demanded that human rights be respected and upheld throughout Central America. Something has happened since and we have walked away from that position. There is no doubt that a Gulfstream jet which was used to transport people to be tortured, if not killed, was facilitated at Shannon Airport. The evidence for this is overwhelming and is believed by competent people in the US, Sweden and elsewhere. We know of this, yet some member of the Government said it had received repeated, high level assurances. When the New Yorker magazine was endeavouring to write a piece about extraordinary rendition, nobody in the US Administration was prepared to talk to that major US magazine. However, apparently, they are all prepared to talk to the Irish Government.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Of course not. We are prepared to nod and wink to each other, and say: "We won't ask and you won't say. We won't let on and you won't pretend, and, hopefully, you won't embarrass us." It is getting to a stage where some civilised country in the Western world must stand back and say that the whole Iraq project has failed.There is no stable Government and no security in Iraq. Some 85% of the people of Iraq now regard the US and British armies as forces of occupation. Barely 10% see them as liberating forces. That is statement enough. Given the increasing desperation, the increasing attrition against civilians and the lie we always suspected we were told about Falluja, the moral position of this country on international affairs demands something more than an anodyne amendment to a reasonably moderate motion — an amendment that could have been written in the White House or at 10 Downing Street.It is shameful that we could not at least get a Government amendment that addressed the specifics. Who is in favour of using chemical weapons? Nobody, but the problem is that one country has used them. Who is in favour of massacring civilians? Nobody, but the problem is that two countries have presided over a regime under which civilians have become easy targets. Members should examine the entire amendment. Nobody is in favour of any of the practices the Government amendment condemns. What we are concerned about is one country acting in a way that is profoundly and morally wrong and that will cause decay.Let us remember that the relationship between Turkey and its neighbours is still, 100 years later, tainted by the massacre of Armenians. Let us remember that our relationship with the neighbouring island is still influenced by what happened here over 85 years ago. These events do not go away. Not only, therefore, are we not achieving any political or military purpose, or progressing any strategic interest of this country, we are conspiring to sow the seeds of hatred and division that will last for another 100 years.

I always enjoy coming to the House, for which I have the utmost regard. I take its Members, its motions and its business very seriously.I know that there is a real sense of concern in the House at recent developments. Attention has naturally focused on the series of disturbing allegations of human rights abuses and on the terrible daily toll of human suffering wrought by shooting and bomb attacks against ordinary civilians. This Private Members' motion raises important issues. The amendment submitted by the Government addresses these issues and places them in context.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	212	No, it does not.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	213	There can be no sense of complacency about the situation in Iraq. It is a country blessed with the richest of natural resources and has a vital role to play in ensuring stability in the Middle East. Most importantly, however, it is a country whose people deserve a better future following years of brutal and corrupt dictatorship, three major wars and international economic isolation. Iraq remains a key foreign policy issue for Ireland and for our partners in the European Union. Our priority must be to support the Iraqi people as they attempt to build a society based on democracy and respect for human rights against a background of widespread and often indiscriminate violence.In addressing our shared concerns, which mostly relate to the security situation, it is important that we recognise the substantial progress made by the Iraqis themselves in the political reconstruction of their country. The Seanad last debated Iraq in May last, almost one year after the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1,546, which set out a path for political reconstruction. Immediately following the adoption of this resolution, the Iraqi Interim Government took over from the Coalition Provisional Authority. Elections for a national assembly were held in January last, and an elected Iraqi Government, with representatives from all communities, was appointed in May last. In recent months, the parties in the assembly have drawn up a new constitution for Iraq, which was approved by the people in a democratic referendum on 15 October. New democratic elections for a fully sovereign Parliament and Government will be held under the constitution on 15 December next.It is incumbent on all of us, as democrats, to recognise that these are impressive political achievements. Even before the December elections, for the first time in its difficult history, Iraq has a democratically-elected Government which represents the majority of its people.We do not underestimate the challenges ahead and we are all keenly aware of the principal outstanding political issue. It is essential that the Iraqi Government and the international community work together to involve the minority Sunni community in the political process. That community for years provided the ruling elite in Iraq. It had very real difficulties with the current constitutional arrangements. Nobody would now wish to see the former marginalisation and disaffection of the majority Shia and Kurdish communities replicated as regards the Sunni community, which makes up about 20% of the country's population.The constitutional referendum in October last highlighted the clear divisions in Iraqi society. Although members of the Sunni community voted strongly against, it is important that they cast their votes. They did participate. We welcome the stated intention of the Sunni parties to participate in the December elections next month. All the parties have agreed that there will be a short period of review of the new constitution following the elections to try to accommodate Sunni concerns once again.Following courageous efforts by the Arab League, led by Secretary General Amr Moussa, it also looks likely that a national reconciliation dialogue meeting will be organised in Iraq early in 2006. A preparatory conference involving representatives of all communities has been held in Cairo in recent days. It produced some notable gestures of reconciliation. In particular, President Talibani stated clearly that he was prepared to talk to representatives of the insurgent groups. It is too early to predict success, but again I believe it is important that we recognise and encourage the courageous efforts of Iraq's political leaders to maintain the unity of their society and of their country.The motion tabled by the Independent Senators rightly raises a number of extremely serious issues as regards the conduct of the Iraqi security forces and of the multinational force in Iraq. It would be inappropriate for us to debate these issues without also recognising the very real dangers facing ordinary Iraqi people, and the horrendous daily toll of civilian casualties inflicted with deliberate, brutal cynicism by groups seeking to foment division and chaos.In this month alone, by the most conservative estimates, over 200 Iraqi citizens have been murdered in indiscriminate bomb attacks on markets, mosques, funerals and other public gatherings. The intention of the attackers is to cause the maximum number of deaths and injuries to innocent civilians. Given our experience of sectarian violence, I think it is only right that the motion which the Seanad passes should clearly recognise and condemn that wanton violence.However, terrorism does not provide any excuse for those in authority to inflict further suffering through the abuse of human rights. There can, for instance, be no excuse for the conditions in which some 170 detainees are reported to have been found by US troops in an Iraqi Interior Ministry building. There appears to be clear evidence that at least some of the detainees had been very severely beaten and maltreated. There are also wider concerns about due process for persons detained in Iraq, admittedly against a background where the courts and legal practitioners are themselves targets for attack. I want to be clear in stating that our Government strongly condemns human rights abuses of this kind in Iraq and everywhere they happen in the world. We have done so consistently in every forum available to us.There have been reports that the situation arises in part because of the incorporation into the security forces of units of Shia militia which are not under the effective control of the central government. It is essential for the future of Iraq that the new democratic Government and its forces demonstrate clearly that they have made a break with the past and will not allow the continuation of the human rights abuses inflicted on their people by previous Iraqi regimes.The Government of Iraq has announced a full Investigation into the case of these detainees and we must await a more clear report of what actually occurred. However, our Government supports the call by the UN Commissioner for Human Rights for consideration by the Iraqi authorities of the possibility of an international inquiry into the wider problems of detention and the treatment of prisoners in Iraq. Considerable concern has been expressed in recent days about the reported use of white phosphorus munitions by US forces in Iraq, especially in the attack on Falluja last November.There have been numerous media reports, not all of which may have been fully accurate. The US authorities have admitted that in their initial reaction to the reports, inaccurate information was given to journalists.

We also strongly oppose the use of any conventional weapons in a manner which is contrary to international law. When he became aware of the recent media reports, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, another Louthman, had immediate inquiries made with the US Embassy to ascertain the actual position. The US Embassy confirmed that US forces had used white phosphorus munitions in Iraq, both to create smokescreens and as incendiary weapons, against defended positions.

It does not regard it as a chemical weapon as defined in the chemical weapons convention. Subsequent international comment and analysis has tended to support this view. A spokesman for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which polices the chemical weapons convention, has been quoted in media reports as suggesting that the weapons concerned were not prohibited by the convention.

Since incendiary weapons achieve their intended effect through the release of thermal energy or heat, they do not fall within the purview of the chemical weapons convention.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I want to make a point of order or a point of information. The Minister of State has unintentionally misled the House. I know this report from the chemicals weapons convention. It is not forbidden when it is being used for illumination purposes only.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I come with the facts as available to me and I communicate them as best I can.While this clarifies the international legal position on the status of white phosphorus, it does not, of course, alleviate concerns about the use of conventional munitions, including white phosphorus, in areas where civilians are present. This Government has clearly and consistently expressed the view before, during and after the events in Falluja, that every possible effort must be made to keep to a minimum the use of force in built-up areas and to avoid civilian casualties. That has been made clear by us on several occasions. The Government of Iraq has now announced that it is sending a team to Falluja to investigate the circumstances in which incendiaries were used in that battle. We look forward to the outcome of that investigation.Other than during large-scale fighting, I am not aware of reports that the Red Cross, Red Crescent, or international media, have been prevented by multinational forces, from entering areas of Iraq. Unfortunately, it seems rather to be the case that potential attacks and kidnappings by insurgents have largely confined them to areas where they can be protected. We in Ireland are very aware of the dangers facing journalists following the kidnapping last month of Mr. Rory Carroll. A free media is an essential element to a democratic society, and it is important that we express our strong support for the courageous and determined efforts of both Iraqi and international journalists——

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The Government and the wider international community, believe that there should be no delay in creating the circumstances under which the Iraqi authorities can take full responsibility for security in their country. The current situation is that the presence of the multinational force in Iraq has been authorised by the UN Security Council through Resolution 1,511 of October 2003, and Resolution 1,546 of June 2004. The mandate was further extended by the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1,637, on 8 November last. The multinational force is legally present in Iraq, under UN mandate, and at the request of the Iraqi Government. Whether we like it or not, it is clear that the Iraqi authorities do not yet feel they are ready to ask for the immediate withdrawal of international troops. A week ago, President Talibani stated that all Iraqis looked forward to the departure of foreign troops and that he hoped for the start of a phased withdrawal before the end of 2006. That is positive and we hope that everything goes well. He also stated that withdrawing now would be a catastrophe and would lead to civil war in Iraq.This is the context for the continuing presence of US forces in Iraq. In March 2003, the Dáil approved the Government's decision to continue the long-standing practice of allowing the use of Shannon by US aircraft. The use of Shannon continues to be in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, which include the request that members of the United Nations contribute assistance to the multinational force, including military forces.Separately, and not directly related to the situation in Iraq, the Government has made it clear that it does not and would not permit the use of any Irish airport for the transport of prisoners without due process of law — a practice which has become known as "extraordinary rendition". Concerns raised about this issue, including by Members of the Oireachtas, have been raised regularly with the US authorities. They have given express assurances to the Government that Irish airports have not been and are not being used for this purpose.

He has mentioned Shannon as one of a number of airports which might have been used by CIA aircraft in some capacity. The references to Shannon, however, do not appear to be any more precise or substantive than similar references on previous occasions. Nevertheless, the Government would be happy to offer all possible assistance to any further investigation by the Council of Europe. I spoke there myself last week. I reiterate the Government's complete opposition to any actions which are contrary to international law, but we have received the clearest assurances from the US authorities in this regard.I am grateful for this opportunity to outline the Government's approach on these extremely important issues regarding Iraq, and to place them in their political context. I commend the Government's amendment to the Seanad.

I read it on a number of occasions and found that it was very balanced. The words used were moderate. For that reason, I am surprised that it needed an amendment. The words could have been accepted by the Government and I must express my disappointment that it did not do so. I also wish to express my admiration for the manner and the tone of the words used by Senator Lydon.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	243	He did so in a balanced way. He was obliged to support the amendment, but I got the impression that he did not do it with enthusiasm. It is fair to say that the motion could have been accepted without an amendment.I would like to make it clear that I take part in this debate as an unashamed friend of the United States. When it comes to friendship, this country should have no hesitation in counting itself on the side of America. The strength of our long-established links — both on an economic and on a personal basis — demand no less. So it is as a friend of America that I support this motion before the House. I do so in the belief that one of the purposes of being friends is that it gives people the freedom to speak frankly to each other. Being a friend does not mean that one must always agree on everything. Being a friend does not mean saying that the friend is always right. In an ideal world, people should be ready to receive criticism from a friend and accept that it is well meant and is grounded in affection.One of the things I like about this motion is that it is focused on the present. It does not seek to rehash the arguments about whether the US should be in Iraq in the first place, or whether the American Government wilfully twisted and misinterpreted the intelligence it used to base its case for an invasion. These are very hot areas of controversy within the US itself at the moment and it is right that they should be so. It is important that they examine that situation but equally, as outsiders, there are other areas that it makes more sense for us to focus on.Whether one is justified or not in getting into a war in the first place is one thing; how that war is conducted is a totally different thing. I would like to say, as a friend, that when America goes to war it must do so from the moral high ground. If it does not do that, it loses any authority it may claim as a defender of freedom and as a champion of democracy. If it does not do that, it cannot hope to maintain the support and respect of its friends. As we know only too well in this country, one has to defend freedom and democracy with one hand tied behind one's back. In other words, in fighting one must respect the very principles that one is defending. If that is not done, one's defence becomes a meaningless sham and the fight degenerates into a power struggle in which might becomes right.This is why I believe that any freedom-loving democracy — whether it is the Irish State, the British state, or the American state — simply cannot afford to fight except by the rules that give its existence its moral authority. A freedom-loving democracy cannot afford to indulge in dirty tricks, regardless of what its opponents may do. We experienced this in Ireland in the past. If it is tempted to do so, it should hope that its friends will be quick to point out where it has lost its way.There are some who laugh at the idea of rules of war, because they see war as a total conflict where anything goes. Others argue that it is ridiculous to bind oneself to rules that are not respected by those against whom one fights, but that is precisely the burden that must be carried by those who would defend what they see as a civilised way of life. If one believes in principles, one must live by one's principles even as one defends them against somebody who does not share one's beliefs. This is why it is with a very heavy heart that I watch how the US is carrying on its struggle in Iraq. One does not have to be against the invasion in the first place, nor harbour any feelings that in some respects the Iraqis were better off before the invasion, nor does one have to be an opponent of the United States, to see clearly that the dirty tricks they are using cannot be justified under any circumstances.This applies to the abuse of prisoners in Iraq itself and in the offshore prison the Americans keep in Cuba, to say nothing of the proxy prisons it apparently operates clandestinely within the borders of the EU. It applies to the use of chemical agents such as white phosphorus referred to in the motion before us. It applies to the condoning of inhuman acts by those Iraqis who now control the Government there. It applies to all these things that we already know about, as well as to the perhaps even worse things that we have not yet found out about. In this situation, it is the duty of a friend to point out that the boundaries of acceptable behaviour have been breached. I believe a friend should persist with that message, even if we get nothing but abuse for doing so.There is another practical dimension to this issue that is referred to in this motion, namely, the use of Shannon Airport. I do not object in principle to allowing the Americans to exercise the traditional rights we have granted them for more than half a century, especially since they now operate in Iraq under the aegis of a UN resolution we are legally bound to support. However, that does not mean we should close our eyes to the possibility that our hospitality has been and is being abused. This House has tried to find the truth about that. The Leader of the House put down a motion on the Adjournment to determine whether that hospitality was being abused, but she was unable to get the answer to it. In normal times, a friend takes the word of another friend without question. However, when that friend has been discovered in repeated acts of deceit and has then tried to lie and bluster its way out of things, then simple prudence surely demands that we at least take the trouble to count our spoons after the guest leaves. Friendship is based on the assumption of good faith between those friends. When we have good reason to doubt that good faith, as I fear is all too clearly the case here, common sense suggests the need to pull back somewhat from a position of total, unquestioning trust. Certainly it is no part of the role of a friend to cover up a friend's wrongdoings. Unfortunately however, that is exactly the impression that our Government has sometimes risked giving in this matter. This is particularly true in respect of the amendment tabled by the Government parties. I hope that even at this late hour, the Government Members will reconsider whether it is required.Our Government must consider carefully what it says and does on this question, both in private and public. If the United States loses the moral high ground in Iraq, it has lost everything. My fear is that out of lack of courage and a misguided sense of what friendship means, our own Government and people would allow themselves be dragged into that same morass. I believe there is a strong case to be made and we should examine its wording carefully. I urge the Minister of State to rethink the requirement for an amendment. I believe the motion tabled by the Independent Senators is worthy of support.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate. Like other Members, when this matter was discussed briefly on the Order of Business last week, I condemned the use of chemical weapons in Iraq and I am glad the Government amendment refers to that issue.It is ironic that the issue which Members originally debated, namely, the reason for the invasion of Iraq, pertained to weapons of mass destruction. Senator Norris referred to the invasion ending in tears and I agree that this is what happened. However, the irony of the American forces using such weapons as they looked for chemical weapons of destruction which never existed is not lost on Members. I am proud that the Seanad has discussed this matter a number of times and the Minister of State noted that this House has had this debate. The issue has also been debated in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.I am concerned by what has happened in Iraq and wish to discuss a few issues. While this may have been mentioned earlier, Deputy Quinn has circulated a letter which highlights the grave plight of Iraqi Christians in two respects. First, people who are obliged to try to leave the country must literally bribe their way out and, second, those who remain must pay protection money. While this has not been reported extensively in the media, I am glad it has received some attention from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.Similarly, the so-called oil for food programme was lauded as one which helped Iraqi people to survive and we only found out subsequently that there was a major scandal associated with it. However, when I visited Iraq almost three years ago, people were proud of it. I met families who spoke about the security they enjoyed under the programme and who were concerned as to what would happen should it break down. We have seen what happened. It has been noted that as far as that programme is concerned, matters are now worse than they were under President Saddam Hussein. The same is true of Iraqi Christians, who are worse off now than they were under that dictator. This is a sad matter to contemplate.I cannot see much hope at present. I am aware that education has received a high priority and I welcome that investment. However, I am still concerned about what I have heard concerning health services and even basic provisions such as water and sewerage facilities, which have not received the expected investment. I agree with the Minister of State's comments in respect of supporting the Government of Iraq, which has been democratically elected. Although others might disagree, I believe that one must accept the elected government of any country. I also agree with the Minister's points concerning a phased withdrawal before the end of 2006.Members should discuss the question of human rights for Iraq's citizens. As the Minister of State noted, I am amazed that there are so many instances of suicide bombing. They take place at funerals — which is appalling — in markets and where people are being recruited into the police force or local government services. I want to know more as to why no security exists there. Regardless of whether the suicide bombings take place in the Middle East, Iraq or any part of that region, all Members abhor and condemn them.I also support the comments made concerning the Arab League, as some hope for the future exists in that respect. It is always positive when countries near Iraq are willing to help out. The same could be said of the peace process in Ireland where, in the main, we deal with our neighbours. When the invasion of Iraq was mooted, I believed the Arab League and Iraq's neighbours would work on the problem more quickly. Much pressure could originate from such sources. Unfortunately, however, the invasion took place, supported by the American and British Governments in particular, as well as by other countries. All Members now know that it was illegal and immoral, as the United Nations resolutions were completely irrelevant when it came to making the decision to invade. Nevertheless, the Arab League has a role to play, which I hope it will do more fruitfully in the future.The Minister of State also referred to the situation regarding journalists and to the experiences of Rory Carroll. It is extremely difficult for the media and anyone else who tries to report on events in Iraq. I was taken by the killing of one of the Iraqi people's greatest friends, Margaret Hassan. Such killings have demonstrated that human rights do not exist there and that law and order has broken down completely.Many issues pertaining to Iraq must be discussed further. While we can discuss motions and amendments in this House, ultimately we wish to see a resolution. We also wish to see elections take place, as well as a phased withdrawal of the troops from Iraq. It is a country which is blessed with natural resources and which has a great future. It should be given a chance to hold those elections and to be free from other countries' interference in its affairs. I again thank the Minister of State for his contribution and hope that Iraq has a brighter future.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate my colleague, Senator Norris, for tabling this motion. I apologise for my absence from the House for almost all of this crucial debate. However, some issues should be put on the record and examined. I regret that the amendment was tabled, as it does not deal with the issues. The Government and the Minister of State's party has always taken a brave line on issues such as Palestine and other unpopular issues. This is a time when we should stand out and there was an opportunity to take a stronger position on this issue.When the Minister of State and I were of school-going age, every second topic debated in the school debating society, whether as Gaeilge nó i mBéarla or whatever, pertained to the contribution which small nations could make to world peace. This was important in the development of all the organisations such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, the Council of Europe, etc. Members have missed a great opportunity to put our position more firmly on the record. We can do that without losing friends. Criticism of George W. Bush's appalling policies is not criticism of the American people, as Senator Norris said in the first debate on this issue over 18 months ago. It suits the people around George W. Bush to portray criticism of him as anti-Americanism, which it is not and will never be. This is the biggest difficulty in this debate.This war started because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Only one person still claims there are hidden weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We went to war without justification. After the war had proceeded for some time Fianna Fáil Senators, including Senators Ó Murchú and Hanafin, said they had been misled. The British Parliament and the American people were misled. The facts are there.We can argue whether the inflection on one part of the argument was different from another, but the reality is that people were misled. When al-Jazeera was available on Sky, I often watched it and admired the channel's courage. It maintained ethical standards and refused to be the creature of al-Qaeda or any other group. It acted as fairly as possible and was an Arab voice giving an important view to the Arab people and the Islamic nations. However, as it was treading a fine line, al-Jazeera was as unpopular with followers of al-Qaeda as with those of George W. Bush.The only outward sign of that was when the American Government closed down the al-Jazeera head office beside the United Nations building in New York. This was an attempt to muzzle a media entity that was doing no harm but trying to bring the truth further. We read in The Guardian yesterday that George W. Bush proposed and considered bombing al-Jazeera’s headquarters. Is there any reason the Irish Government could not say “If that is true, it is wrong and we want to distance ourselves from it”? We must have ethical standards in our global contacts. I ask the Minister of State to discuss that suggestion in his Department. I do not suggest anything that would bring the Irish Government into deep international problems but somebody has to shout “Stop”. We lost the opportunity with the debate on weapons of mass destruction. We were misled but the debate has moved on. This is today’s issue and we should recognise it.Another issue is the question of white phosphorous. Imagine if we discovered that Saddam Hussein, al-Qaeda or another repressive regime used it. There would be outrage and we would condemn it. There is something completely wrong about it. Nobody can justify it. Why can this Government not say conditionally that if America used white phosphorous, it is wrong and contravenes a million international conventions? We should set the standards, even in conditional terms. Let others argue whether it took place or not. We will have established our position without passing judgment. This way we would establish what is wrong before we know who did it, rather than vice versa. Surely our diplomats can take us down that road.The Minister has travelled all over the world. The biggest issue, and the reason we are missing an opportunity here, is that we are polarising the globe. Islamic society is developing a deep hatred for Western beliefs, idioms, morality and culture and in the West we are developing a deep hatred for Islam. This is utterly wrong on both sides but it is being inexorably inculcated into our psyche.We are dividing the world into "for" and "against". A pro-Zionist Israeli educationalist has done a huge study on the attitude, culture, background, beliefs and drives of suicide bombers. He has followed and studied every one of them and their families. It is frightening to read it because these people feel as justified as Tomás Aghas or Terence McSwiney when they went on hunger strike. Senator Norris has said in this House that suicide bombing is wrong and that the leaders of the societies and political systems in the Middle East that are producing suicide bombers should make that position clear. All sides must show leadership, take responsibility and mark the boundaries of acceptability.The fact that people are locked up in Guantanamo Bay is a blot on our understanding of Western culture. They have been disgracefully treated. Their holy books, icons and beliefs have been disgracefully treated. People who have condemned Guantanamo Bay have suffered attempts to blacken their names and break up their private lives. It usurps the most basic right of habeas corpus on which all Western legal systems are built. I can use only broad brushstrokes but I hope the Minister will take something from this and begin a debate in his Department.

I have often said I am a friend and supporter of America and I have availed of American hospitality many times over the decades. Today I am deeply ashamed of America. What it is doing offends my sense of morality and I must speak from my heart. I return to the first shrieks we heard from the "shock and awe" invasion of Iraq. At that time I said it was immoral, illegal and totally unjustified because it was based on a wrong premise and was against the wishes of the United Nations. America and its few allies have damaged the credibility of the United Nations forever. In their subsequent actions, they damaged their own credibility. I have no doubt that young Americans in years to come will feel exactly like young Germans after the Holocaust. I have already seen the reaction to them. I hosted people from Canada and the US in this House in the early stages of the Iraqi invasion. They asked me the straight question of why Ireland was anti-American. I remember subsequently meeting a young couple from Clonmel who attended a funeral in Ireland. They asked me exactly the same question. I said that Ireland was not anti-American, but that enough Irish people and sections of the media were not prepared to accept what was happening, since it was an abhorrence. All that can flow from it is further inhumanity throughout the world.We need not wait to learn about the use of chemical weapons, since I do not believe the Americans any more. It is as simple as that, and that is the saddest part. I do not accept it when they tell us that they made a mistake by saying that they were not using such weapons, nor do I accept the spin that they now put on it. They are trying to split the definition of chemical weapons. All that I know is that white phosphorous was very graphically explained today. We have all read similar reports and seen pictures of its results. The victims were not just insurgents, since we have seen the marks on children. It can burn human bodies indiscriminately. Let us all ask ourselves whether we would like our children or grandchildren to be on the receiving end of that weapon. We would not be splitting the definition if that happened, and it is happening.

The only reason that it has been admitted and exposed is that the perpetrators had no choice but to own up to the fact that it had happened. Can anyone here stand over a captive being treated in that manner, when for several decades we have been trying to bring about a world order that will ensure that what happened in the past never recurred? The very people to whom we looked for guidance and support are those who now, for whatever political reasons, are at this point in history doing exactly what they themselves condemned in the past. I am very sorry that I must say this, and I feel that today I have a split personality politically. My heart is with the motion tabled in this House. Senators will know from the Order of Business that, week in and week out, I have made exactly the same statements——

It is not possible for me to stand up and say the opposite.The other side of my personality is the political one, and with a heavy heart I will have to vote for the Government amendment. However, I will have it clearly on the record that the day that I believe we are making progress is when the Government does not table an amendment to a motion of this kind. What would the consequence be for our Government to do what Senator O'Toole said? It would be a very difficult one, but I said the other morning on the Order of Business that the biggest difficulty I see is not the barbarity of which we now hear from both sides but the impact that it will have on world order in the long run.It is happening because most nations, who are part of a fraternity, are not able to step aside and give an independent view. If we acquiesce in what has happened, the world order will be changed in such a way that there will be no security and no safety. Ultimately, there will be terrible suffering. We keep hearing about another world war. In a way, it is happening all over the world at present.One can see the terrorism being spread. I would like to put a question on the record. Is there any difference between the terrorism of the insurgents and that of the multinational force? The only difference that I see is that they have the power and the might. I have never seen any moral distinction between the big bomb and the small one. As far as I was concerned, it was not a matter of how one did it. Let us recall the night we watched what people did not then regard as horrific pictures — the shock and awe tactics. We felt as if we were inside a cinema watching a film, but I kept thinking of children on the ground, the elderly and invalids wondering why the world was doing that to them. Their lives were absolutely and utterly obliterated, while the Americans played political games.I have listened to Donald Rumsfeld without being able to understand what the man was saying. He was talking a jargon meant to be English, but I could not understand. What I did know, however, was that at the end of that jargon was human suffering. He was part of the regime trying to perpetrate that suffering. It had nothing to do with the attacks of 11 September 2001. They were abominable acts against a freedom-loving people. Friends of mine were caught up in that terrible tragedy. However, the invasion of Iraq was on the cards before any attack. It is no longer a secret that the Americans regard themselves as world police. I regard them as domineering people trying to impose their will on everyone else. If they do not do so militarily, they will do so economically.At the moment, I see hopeful signs that the Americans themselves are reacting and responding. I speak not only of former Presidents but of the media and everyone. Let us consider what happened in Vietnam. One was regarded as a traitor for several years for suggesting that what was happening there was totally and utterly wrong. Subsequently, everyone jumped on the bandwagon, and everyone agreed that killing 3 million Vietnamese, with the barbarity and cruelty inflicted on them, had no justification. We are in exactly the same position today, and unless we all put our shoulder to the wheel and push that other bandwagon a little faster and more strongly, we only delay the opportunity to bring some semblance of sense to events.Our difficulty is this. We look back at the invasion and see where we are now. It is strange to say that the invaders went in because they said there were weapons of mass destruction but that now they cannot get out because there might be civil war. There is no rationale to that argument. I know that efforts are being made to talk to the insurgents, but they are not strong enough. They had better talk to them and work on the basis that there is no place for America, Britain or any of those other forces in Iraq in the long term.I accept that we must respect the fact that elections have been held and what is happening with their constitution. However, it will not work in the manner that America envisages. The only thing that will force America to revert to the previous situation is the political climate within that country itself. That is changing very fast, and one need only look at George Bush's ratings to realise that he has made a mess of this. However, to make matters worse, they are eyeing Iran and North Korea. At this stage, they are eyeing the entire world, and it is not too much to say that what is likely to happen there is that they may need another conflict.Senators know that there is a kind of gung-ho attitude with most powers. Exactly the same thing happened with Maggie Thatcher in Britain. If their boys are in trouble or having difficulty, they feel that they must respond. I am afraid they might create a situation that will start the whole wheel turning again. I will support the Government amendment, but I must compliment those who tabled the motion. I compliment them on the sense behind their contributions, particularly the graphic descriptions.I am convinced that might should never succeed over right. In this regard, I refer to the rights of the individual, particularly the most vulnerable people on this earth. Our first task must be to support them. If one considers the history of Ireland, one will note it has always been regarded as an honest broker, as having integrity and as peace-loving nation prepared to send peacekeepers all over the world. We must use this position and not allow it to be diluted. Above all else, we must keep debating this issue in the House.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I distance myself from the remarks made by Senator Ryan and exonerate the Minister of State for any inappropriate attitude. I did not attack him personally but simply placed a factual legal matter on the record of the House. It would be easy for me to try to embarrass my colleagues on the Government benches but I will not do so. Instead, I salute them on their moral courage in saying what they said. I am proud of them and thank them from the bottom of my heart for the position they have taken. My colleague, Senator O'Toole, made the very good suggestion that this matter be taken back to their party for discussion — that is the democratic way to do it. I am not bothered about the vote. It is now perfectly clear that it is a farce because the House has spoken with a unified voice, which is terribly important.I pay tribute to the decency of some of the American troops. It was as a result of their activities in searching for a missing teenage boy that the torture victims were found beaten and starved in an Iraqi Government bunker last week. We now know that 173 detainees were arbitrarily arrested and held without charge in the basement of the Interior Ministry building, after which they were held in an underground bunker. The sectarian nature of the detentions is clear from the fact that all the detainees were Sunni Muslims. Mr. Abdul-Hamid, head of the Iraqi Islamic Party, said in a statement, "According to our knowledge, regrettably all the detainees were Sunnis. In order to search for a terrorist, they used to detain hundreds of innocent people and torture them brutally."Reports printed in reputable newspapers such as The Guardian include the information that, in addition to live persons, mutilated corpses — including some with electric drill holes in their heads — and torture instruments had also been found at the underground bunker. Another paper of record, The Observer, stated that its reporters had seen photographic evidence of post mortem and hospital examinations of alleged terror suspects from Baghdad and the Sunni triangle which demonstrates serious abuse of suspects, including burnings, strangulation, the breaking of limbs and, in one case, the apparent use of an electric drill to perform a knee capping. This is all part of a pattern.One could take the case of an imam, Mr. Hassan an-Ni'ami, at a suburban mosque in Baghdad. He was arrested by paramilitary police commandos and taken for interrogation. His capture was reported on television as that of a senior terrorist commander, which was untrue. Twelve hours later, his body was in the city morgue. The Observer states:What happened to him in his twenty four hours in captivity was written across his body in chapters of pain, recorded by the camera. There are police-issue handcuffs still attached to one wrist, from which he was hanged long enough to cause his hands and wrists to swell. There are burn marks on his chest as if someone had placed something very hot near his right nipple and moved it around.A little lower are a series of horizon welts, wrapping around his body and breaking the skin as they turn around his chest, as if he had been beaten with something flexible, perhaps a cable. There are other injuries: a broken nose and smaller wounds that look like cigarette burns.An arm appears to have been broken and one of the higher vertebrae pushed inwards. There is a cluster of small, neat circular wounds on both sides of his left knee. At some stage an-Ni'ami seems to have been efficiently knee capped. It was not done with a gun — the exit wounds are identical in size to the entry wounds, which would not happen with a bullet. Instead it appears to have been done with something like a drill.This kind of behaviour happened under the gaze and with the tacit complicity of elements within the coalition forces. One international official stated:What is so worrying is that allegations concerning the use of drills and irons during torture just keep coming back. And we have seen precisely the same evidence of torture on bodies that have turned up after they have been arrested. There is a dirty counter-insurgency war, led on the anti-insurgency side by groups responsible to different leaders.America is at last waking up to this horror. It is for this reason that Republican Senator John McCain made an amendment to a military spending Bill in the Senate in which he proposed prohibiting the use of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by US personnel anywhere in the world. The amendment was passed — 90 voted in favour and nine against. It was then incorporated into the Senate Bill, which was eventually passed with some other modifications. However, the House of Representatives passed its own version of the Bill in the past week, without any of these provisions relating to the treatment of detainees. Vice-President Dick Cheney has recently spent a great deal of time lobbying Republicans to make an exemption from the McCain amendment for the CIA. On top of this, President Bush has come into the open, supported torture tactics and threatened to use his presidential veto to strike down any proposal that includes a blanket ban on mistreatment.It is a matter of shame that the Irish Government, despite repeated questions from me, the Leader of this House, members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and members of many parties in the Lower House, has made no qualification on the use of Shannon Airport for military traffic of all kinds. The Minister for Transport is responsible for civil aircraft while the Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for regulating the activities of foreign military aircraft. The carriage of weapons and munitions on civilian aircraft requires an exemption from the Minister for Transport. Up to and including 17 November 2005, a total of 1,287 exemptions had been granted by the Minister for Transport. Up to 31 October 2005, the number of US military troops passing through Shannon was 268,963. This makes us shamefully complicit in the waging of an illegal war.A deeply worrying question arises regarding the Gulfstream V jet aircraft that has been permitted to continue using Shannon Airport's facilities. Other countries are not so pusillanimous and some ban the flights. Denmark denies access, and Austria had fighters intercept a  suspect aircraft and escort it out of its airspace. Hungary searches the aircraft on the tarmac.Some time ago in this House I was able to demonstrate, by an analysis of replies given in the Lower House, that American officials had lied to the Minister, leading him to misinform the House that these flights had ceased. The CIA had merely changed the registration number of the plane. This plane is known to have been involved in extraordinary rendition — it has done nothing else. Why should one believe it is taking tourists through Shannon Airport? By extraordinary rendition, I refer to the kidnapping and transfer of suspected persons to third countries for the purposes of torture. On 21 May 2005, the foreign service of The Washington Post stated:Stockholm — the CIA Gulfstream V jet touched down at a small airport west of here just before 9 p.m. on a subfreezing night in December 2001 . . . Swedish officers watched as CIA operatives pulled out scissors and rapidly sliced off the prisoners clothes, including their underwear ... At 9.47 p.m., less than an hour after its arrival at Bromma Airport, the jet took off on a five-hour flight to Cairo, where the prisoners, Ahmed Agiza and Mohammed Zery, were handed over to Egyptian security officials.The Taoiseach, in a reply to Deputy Michael D. Higgins last week, quoted an unsourced Human Rights Watch report, which is itself the subject of serious doubt, to suggest that it is unlikely that a major civilian airport would be used by the CIA for this traffic. However, the BBC radio programme "File on Four" broadcast a report from Stephen Grey which states:This is Dulles Airport, Washington, within easy reach of both the Pentagon and the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Our flight logs showed that on almost every occasion when the Gulfstream jet leaves America, it passes through this airport.The report further states that the Gulfstream jet also passes through Glasgow, Prestwick, Queen Ali International Airport in Amman, Jordan, and Kastrup Airport in Copenhagen. I am aware that citizens of this Republic have reported their suspicions and the detailed evidence from outside the State about the purposes to which this aircraft is put. The Garda has refused to take action and notification of these facts has been routinely ignored. As a result, I have written to Mr. Noel Conroy, the Garda Commissioner, as follows:Dear Commissioner,I am writing to you as a citizen and as an elected public representative to draw to your attention the fact that there is a clear prima facie case that a crime may have been committed by the landing of gulf stream jet, call sign N3 79P, at Shannon airport. I am also aware that a number of citizens have made complaints of a detailed nature to the police authorities in Limerick to no avail.The aeroplane concerned has certainly been used by the American authorities for activities which are considered illegal under international law i.e. extraordinary rendition. You will be aware of the fact also that the Minister for Transport unintentionally misled the Dáil on the basis of misinformation supplied to the Government by unnamed American officials. You will be aware also that through the evidence of Harry Cohen MP the American authorities lied about the commission of parallel crimes by the employment of white phosphorus in Iraq a situation which led to Minister Adam Ingram MP misleading the House of Commons and having to admit this fact subsequently.I have discussed this matter with members of the House of Commons at Westminster who are in possession of an opinion from international lawyers that the landing of such a plane if it is being used for such a purpose constitutes a crime under international law.Ireland has already been reported because of this matter to United Nations Sub Committee for investigation. I am making this formal request that you fully investigate the matter and that this aeroplane is routinely subjected to garda investigation if and when it lands at Shannon airport. I should advise you that I will be making the contents of this message available to the international investigating authorities in the belief that further inaction by the garda authorities would be seriously regarded. I await a speedy reply.Yours sincerely,Senator David NorrisI encourage every Member of the House to write a similar letter to the Garda Commissioner. American public opinion is changing. No longer will people tolerate the bluster of Dick Cheney, who never served in Vietnam because he was able to pull strings and achieved no less than five draft deferments, infamously saying that he had "priorities in the sixties other than military service". He was content to send other people's children out to die. For a man such as that to accuse others——

It is significant that Representative John Murtha, a known hawk in defence matters, has stated that the war had obviously been a mistake and that the American people were misled because intelligence reports had been exaggerated. Having been labelled by the Administration as a defeatist, he received enormous support from the American public. He told NBC's "Meet the Press", "It is not me, it is the public that is thirsting for answers."I am proud of this House tonight because of the decent behavior of my colleagues on the Government side.

That is a listed building built in the 1300s and restored in the 18th century by the Earl of Dunraven who, in 1807, gave the building to the Church of Ireland as a place of worship for the community of Adare.The existing St. Nicholas's national school is part of and adjacent to this church. The board of management has acquired a site from the Dunraven family for a proposed new building project. Fund-raising is ongoing and the community supports the project. I ask the Minister of State to take all the circumstances into consideration and ask the Department to fund this new building project to meet the needs of our community in Adare at this historic location.

It has an enrolment of approximately 65 pupils and staffing of a principal teacher, two assistant teachers and a resource teacher.As the Senator is aware, my Department is moving towards a model of devolving funding, responsibility and authority as appropriate for building projects directly to school management authorities. Devolving of funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.This particular devolved initiative was originally introduced on a pilot basis for 20 schools in the 2003 school building programme and, due to the positive feedback from schools, was extended in the school building programmes of 2004 and 2005. While appropriate for many schools, the Department is aware that the devolved initiative is not necessarily suitable for all national schools seeking to refurbish their school building or to build new accommodation. It is not the intention of the scheme to leave schools with massive fund-raising requirements. Rather, the level of funding should determine the scope of works undertaken. In some cases, however, the school site or building can be problematic. In others, the extent of the required work is too extensive for the funding available under the initiative.In such situations, schools have a number of choices. They can reduce the scope of intended works, fund-raise to cover the shortfall or withdraw from the scheme and be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project's priority band rating.This school was offered a grant of €350,000 under the devolved initiative in 2004 to provide new accommodation. The board of management accepted the grant offered and proceeded with the architectural planning of the project.The type of building that the board of management can construct is determined by the sensitive location and nature of the site. The school has received planning permission for a new school building subject to a number of conditions, including the requirement for all works to be supervised by a conservation architect and that a suitably-qualified archaeologist has to monitor all site works. The architectural planning of the building is currently at an advanced stage.It is clear from the information supplied by the school to officials in my Department that the grant of €350,000 will not be sufficient to construct the building as currently designed. Officials from my Department met with the school authorities on 17 November to discuss this difficulty. The school has formally lodged an appeal for additional funding and officials from my Department will be in contact with the school shortly on this matter. I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter in the House.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Many Bulgarian nurses work abroad. Bulgaria is a poor country and they go abroad to earn money to send home to their families. In particular, they travel to the Middle East and north Africa.I wish to refer to what was initially a group of about 40 nurses who worked in the children's hospital in Benghazi, Libya. In February 1999, they were arrested and charged with intentionally infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV. It was never made clear to me or to anyone, and I have asked the Libyan ambassador to the European Union in Brussels about the matter, why anyone would want to deliberately infect children with HIV. Eventually the group held under arrest was reduced to five nurses and a Palestinian doctor and these unfortunate people have either been in jail or under house arrest since 1999. Some claim to have been treated very badly while they were in prison. Indeed, two of them claim to have been raped but the people who were accused were acquitted of any wrongdoing.International medical experts have testified that the Benghazi HIV outbreak began two years before the foreign nurses and doctor were employed. As we know, HIV outbreaks have occurred in most parts of the world and poor hygiene and lack of knowledge of risks are the most frequent causes. It was felt in this case that the use of unsterilised needles and HIV contaminated blood transfusions were important in Benghazi, as elsewhere. When I met the Libyan ambassador to the EU, I pointed out that we had similar problems here. They have occurred everywhere. Some 40 children have died and their parents, as well as public opinion in Libya, must be placated. It seems the cases against these nurses and doctor are the required sacrifice.The accused have been through the legal system and have been sentenced to death. Their final appeal against this sentence took place on 15 November but a decision has been postponed until 31 January 2006. It is claimed that some of the accused gave confessions under torture, an action that was taken to aid the prosecution case. President Gaddafi has said that if confessions were procured under torture, that evidence would not be admissible. He will not intervene in the case, however, saying that the courts must decide. The suggestion has been made that $3 billion in compensation should be paid to the relatives of those who died in the outbreak, a similar sum to that given by Libya to the relatives of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing. This cannot be agreed, however, because it would be an admission that the nurses and doctor deliberately infected the children, which they did not.The Bulgarian Government did not initially seek publicity because it believed a quiet approach to the Libyan Government was the best option. However, it is now desperate for help. The Irish Government has been helpful in the past and the EU and United States Government have spoken out. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take any action he can to aid the relief of these people. An imaginative solution is needed. I have asked members of Sinn Féin who have had relationships with Libya if they can do anything. The situation is so desperate that we must all consider any action that can be taken. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, will convey this message to the Department of Foreign Affairs.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	263	The Government fully shares the concern of Senators for the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical workers who have been imprisoned in Libya for more than six years and under sentence of death for the past 18 months. I assure the House that the Government has expressed its concern directly to the Libyan Government and has been active in maintaining attention on the issue at EU level. We continue to be very supportive of Bulgaria's efforts to impress on Libya the urgency of a positive outcome to the case.The Government welcomes the continuing interest of Members in the situation of the medical workers. I understand the Bulgarian ambassador held a useful meeting on the case with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs earlier this year. There had been a real sense of hope that the Libyan Supreme Court would act to resolve the issue by granting the appeal against conviction of the medical workers. A decision on the appeal was expected last week, on 15 November. Instead, however, the court postponed its judgment for the second time, until 31 January 2006. It is appropriate therefore that we now signal clearly our continuing strong concerns about this case.In May 2004, after five years' imprisonment, five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor were convicted of deliberately infecting 400 children in Benghazi hospital with HIV. Based on the reports of the trial by EU observers, the Government and our partners in the EU took the clear view that the conduct of the trial was unfair and that the convictions were unwarranted by the evidence. Libyan medical staff accused of the same offence, and the Libyan police accused of obtaining confessions by torture, have been acquitted or had their cases dropped.The infection of the children in hospital is an appalling tragedy that has naturally caused outrage among the Libyan public. Qualified international experts testified at the trial, however, that the infections were caused by faulty and unhygienic practices at the hospital. They also testified that, in many cases, the infection had occurred before the convicted staff had even arrived in Libya. The Government's view is absolutely clear, therefore, that the convictions should be set aside and the prisoners released.This view was conveyed in the strongest terms to the Libyan Foreign Minister by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, at a Euro-Mediterranean meeting in Dublin in May 2004, during Ireland's EU Presidency. He spoke to the Minister on the day the verdict and sentences were pronounced. Following the conviction, I understand the physical conditions of detention of the prisoners have improved somewhat. However, they are now in their seventh year of detention and are under sentence of death. There are very serious concerns about their psychological health.As the appeal process has unfolded, Ireland has actively supported Bulgaria's requests for EU assistance in resolving this matter. The EU has stated firmly, in Council statements and in direct approaches to the Libyan authorities, that the convictions were unsound and should be reversed. The EU has also specifically stated that a positive resolution of this issue will be an important factor in permitting an overall improvement in EU-Libya relations, a development both sides wish to achieve.The Government will continue to maintain attention on this important issue. It was discussed most recently at the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs attended in Brussels on 21 November. We are convinced that, building on our bilateral protest, common EU action is the best way to proceed. Bulgaria has advised us that the Libyan Court of Appeal has adopted a new procedure and will allow a new hearing of the case at the end of January. Bulgaria is hopeful this may prove a positive development. The Government naturally shares this hope and will continue to follow the situation closely in co-operation with the Bulgarian authorities and our EU partners.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	267	For the past seven years, there have been rumours about the replacement of the existing facilities at St. Brendan's Hospital, Loughrea, County Galway. In the recent past, it housed and provided facilities for some 220 patients. However, given that its buildings were old, with many narrow stairs and so on, health and safety concerns necessitated that, over the years, when patients vacated upstairs facilities, their beds were removed and not replaced. There are now some 120 patients in the hospital and the proposal is that it will, in future, provide facilities for 80 patients.The hospital has a waiting list of 28 female patients and 25 male patients. Some of these are waiting up to 16 months for access. The physical environment of the hospital makes it difficult for the staff to deliver a quality service. Against all the odds, however, the nursing, medical and other support staff have delivered a first class service as a result of their commitment and dedication to the needs of the elderly patients. Of those elderly from neighbouring areas who have availed of the day care centre adjacent to the hospital and part of its complement of facilities, many want to remain there as full-time patients. It is sad that they cannot get such access.When the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children visited the hospital recently, she expressed her concerns about the physical conditions and the difficulties under which the staff must work in order to maintain the quality service. She immediately requested that the plans for the hospital be sent to her as she had not seen them. This was two months ago. Action was taken last Friday in order to move the planning process forward to some degree. At what stage of planning and financing is this project and when will the work commence? This is the bottom line. As far back as 1998 we were promised a modern and comprehensive community-based hospital for the elderly in the hinterland of east County Galway with full facilities, including step down facilities, and support mechanisms in terms of staff and so on. With the exception of physiotherapy, none of these are available. There are one or two respite beds in the hospital.The urgency of this matter cannot be emphasised enough. Senator Kitt will agree that, while health and safety was a concern of the people who worked in those conditions and allowed the situation to develop, something has gone wrong given the decrease in patient numbers from 220 to 120 without alternative accommodation for them. I want to see this situation rectified urgently.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I thank Senator Ulick Burke for sharing his time and the Minister of State for attending this debate. The Senator said there is a great need for beds for the elderly, to which the waiting list alone is testament. The reduction in the number of patients from 220 to 80 is significant. The Minister of State will probably say in her reply that Ballinasloe has been earmarked for another centre, perhaps a smaller one than the 80-patient unit in Loughrea.Significant work has been done in St. Brendan's Hospital in Loughrea. A certain stigma might have attached to it in the past but everyone now speaks about the good level of care provided for the elderly there under very difficult circumstances. It was announced in the Estimates that funding was available but I do not know whether the funding was just for Loughrea or east County Galway. The Minister of State might be able to clarify the matter.There is a waiting list and we have heard talk about two new units in Loughrea for seven years, as Senator Ulick Burke pointed out. It would be timely to start on the centre in Loughrea in the context of the current Estimates. Will Ballinasloe be included? There is a need for a number of centres in east County Galway to provide the service given in difficult times by the lay and religious at St. Brendan's Hospital.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I thank Senators Ulick Burke and Kitt for raising this matter and welcome the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. Significant capital funding for the health sector has been provided since the commencement of the national development plan in 2000. Total expenditure for the period 2000-03 was approximately €1.7 billion.Considerable progress has been made in addressing the historical deficits in health infrastructure and improving the standards of facilities required for quality, modern patient care. The NDP provides considerable capital funding for services for older people. On a national basis, this will enable a comprehensive infrastructure of community nursing units and day-care facilities to be put in place as well as the refurbishment of existing extended-care facilities and the replacement of old workhouse type accommodation. Older people deserve first-class facilities and we intend to provide them in appropriate locations.As the House will be aware, the Health Act 2004 established the Health Service Executive which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the proposed developments at St. Brendan's Hospital, Loughrea. The HSE, western area, has stated the project planning brief for the development of a 40-bed community nursing unit in Loughrea with expansion to 80 beds was signed off on 17 November 2005. It will now go to tender for the appointment of a design team.Approval has been granted to bring the project to the design stage. The HSE has advised that the local multidisciplinary team, which will advise on the design, has been appointed. This proposal is included as part of the HSE's capital investment framework for 2005-09. The HSE has outlined that the replacement community nursing unit will be located on the grounds of the St. Brendan's Hospital campus and will be used to facilitate the transfer of residents currently placed on the upper floors of the original building. As responsibility for the development of health services now rests with the HSE, any decisions relating to this project will be a matter for it, having regard to its overall capital funding priorities.
