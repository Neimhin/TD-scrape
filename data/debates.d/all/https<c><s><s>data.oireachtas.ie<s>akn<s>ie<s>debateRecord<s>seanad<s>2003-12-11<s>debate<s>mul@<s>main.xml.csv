#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Bradford that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to intervene with the appropriate authorities concerning the case of Mr. Roger Collins who has spent 25 years on death row in Georgia, United States.I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the regulations entitled European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2003, which she intends to bring forward shortly, are in line with the spirit of EU Directive 2001/29/EC of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion, to be taken without debate, whereby the subject matter of No. 13 on today's Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Health and Children for consideration. The Health Insurance (Amendment) Acts 2001 and 2003 include provisions relating to the introduction of a risk equalisation scheme. It is now considered necessary to make amendments to two of the definitions contained in that scheme; No. 2, a procedural motion agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the attendance of Seán Ó Neachtáin, MEP, in the House this afternoon, with the arrangements as outlined in the motion; No. 3, a procedural motion agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the attendance of Avril Doyle, MEP, in the House this afternoon, with the arrangements as outlined in the motion; No. 4, a procedural motion agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the attendance of Brian Crowley, MEP, in the House this afternoon, with the arrangements as outlined in the motion; and, No. 5, Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 – Report and Final Stages to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business, to conclude no later than 1 p.m.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The two issues I wish to raise relate to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the first of which is the independent report by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority on insurance costs. Any of us would be shocked, given lower insurance and litigation costs, that the Irish motorist is still fleeced. Given that there are only eight insurance companies in the Irish market it is difficult to reconcile the differential between quotes of €1,100 and €6,000. I appreciate the Minister has instructed people to shop around and that is good advice. I ask her also to intervene with the insurance industry to ask them to at least pass on the savings made to the consumer.The second point I wish to raise has the potential to be a time bomb in 2005. There is a huge problem in regard to the shortage of nurses, particularly in the intensive care units of our hospitals. More than 5,000 nurses have come from overseas, 90% of whom are Filipino. In the Mater Hospital, 80% of the nurses in the intensive care unit are Filipino. They have become a vital component in the health care industry here and are employed on two year contracts. Given the tight budgetary constraints of health boards, the contracts are renewed on a three monthly or six monthly basis. Many of the nurses are based in Dublin and have no living-out allowance owing to the high rental costs in Dublin. When their husbands come here, they are debarred from being considered for work permits. In the context of the health care industry, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment must look at this issue because these nurses are attracted to countries such as Australia. They can even go to Belfast where they can get a permit for their husbands if they decide to work there. They have been attracted to the United States where they undergo an examination. In 2002, the three year diploma course became a four year degree course. In 2005, no Irish nurses will come on stream from the hospitals and we will face a potential time bomb. At present, approximately 1,600 Irish nurses come on stream each year. I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to look at this issue and do something about work permits with a view to our being compatible with other overseas countries. I appreciate I have been allowed considerable latitude on this issue. There was a tragedy recently in Crumlin Hospital due to a lack of staff in the intensive care unit. This could happen in other hospitals and the Minister for Health and Children should remove any impediments to the recruitment of nurses.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Yesterday was International Human Rights Day but we did not mark it in this House. I ask the Leader if we could mark it with discussions on a series of human rights issues. To mark the day yesterday, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties organised a lecture by Mr. Mike Posner from the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in New York. It was very interesting and would have been useful in the context of the debates we have had in this House because he spoke from inside America about the erosion of human rights by the Bush Administration and the impact that has on other countries which imitate it. America celebrated International Human Rights Day by killing another six children in Afghanistan to add to the nine it killed the previous day. The Israelis are consistently involved in similar operations.We should place in that perspective our own performance of our duties towards our citizens, particularly regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the constitutional requirement on the State to vindicate the right to life of its citizens. That was not done. I ask for a debate, in the context of human rights, on the Barron report. Among other points, there are reproaches in it of the Oireachtas and, in particular, of the Government of the time for not pursuing the information it clearly had and for not vindicating the human rights of the ordinary citizens who were going about their business in the city of Dublin and the town of Monaghan. It may have been a political decision and it may be that it was an "appalling vista", to quote the late Lord Denning, but appalling vistas must be faced sooner or later. If they are avoided, they just become worse. I call for a debate on human rights generally and also a separate debate on the Barron report.We should discuss electronic voting before we finally cross the legal hurdle and sign a contract. Deputy Seán Power, who obviously is not anti-Government, has come up with interesting information about the possible technical dangers of electronic voting, the degree of error and the lack of a paper trail. It would be worthwhile to examine the issue. Ireland is different from countries like Australia, where there are massive distances to be confronted, or America, where there are massive populations to be confronted. Before we spend €50 million on installing a system that may not be appropriate for this country, we should examine it in detail.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I agree with the points made yesterday about the reaction to the Barron report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. We should not rush to judgment but it is imperative that both the British and Irish Governments take the lead in terms of where we go next. What is the next step? We owe this not only to the victims, but to their families and the survivors who suffered such grievous loss on that fateful day 29 years ago.Electronic voting was discussed at the meeting of the Committee on the Environment and Local Government. I was not at the meeting because I was engaged in a debate in this House, but expert advice revealed a degree of doubt about the electronic voting system. A number of academics, including a PhD student, were present and they were well versed on the issue. They pointed out flaws in the system. The chairman of the committee, Deputy Seán Power, is writing to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to convey the committee's reservations. It is imperative that the Minister looks at what we now know about electronic voting and considers ways to resolve difficulties with the system. The local and European elections are in June 2004 and a substantial amount of money is being spent on electronic voting not just on implementing the system, but on advertising it. It is imperative that it is examined and I ask the Leader to convey that message to the Minister and get a response.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Insurance was mentioned again this morning, an issue that has been raised in this House many times. The comments by the Tánaiste that people should shop around have been widely remarked upon in the media. Good news should also be put on the record. For the past couple of years, for small businesses, the arrival of a renewal notice heralded higher prices. This morning, however, my renewal notice arrived and the cost has been reduced from €16,000 to €9,900 as a result of shopping around. Instead of waiting for the Government to act, we can shop around and it will lead to cheaper policy costs. I reduced my car insurance this week from €1,310 to €868 by shopping around. All Members should advise the public to shop around.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The IRFU has presented its plans for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road as a national stadium. Could the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism come to the House as soon as possible to indicate what the Government proposes to do about the development of a stadium? The Government scuppered the FAI's plans for Eircom park, which would be up and running now if it was not for the promise of the Bertie Bowl. There are now plans before the Government and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism should tell us what decision has been made as soon as possible. This is of paramount importance when we consider forthcoming soccer and rugby internationals.There was a death in Waterford Regional Hospital last year from legionnaire's disease and the report of the inquiry was published yesterday. It stated that the air and water quality in every hospital should be examined. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to explain what steps he is taking to ensure action is taken on the findings of the inquiry as soon as possible?
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I support Senator Finucane's call for a debate on insurance and on other sectors. I take on board Senator Morrissey's point that there is an onus on consumers to shop around and, thus, generate the competition that leads to best prices. The Central Bank, however, issued a report yesterday that showed that interest rates on both deposit and loan accounts are not as favourable here as they are in other euro zone areas. The Tánaiste's investigation into dentists, doctors, solicitors and other professions indicates that we should have a debate on price control. The Tánaiste opposes price controls – she supports market forces – but where there is an obvious failure, the State has a duty to intervene to ensure consumers get value for money. People are now going to Northern Ireland to get dental treatment at a fraction of the cost of treatment here. I was in the North recently and I came across people who were there for that purpose. It highlights our failure to achieve competitive prices. The debate should also cover non-productive areas, such as barristers' fees, that are fleecing the productive sector of the economy and affecting economic growth. The Leader might get ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to look at the mechanisms for public hearings by committees of the House. The non-compellability of witnesses is a fundamental flaw in the apparatus and operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas and it does not appear to be addressed at all. It is not a matter for Government but for the Houses to take the initiative in this regard. Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad might do this and in conjunction with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the Dáil take legal advice and come to some conclusions.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Some months ago when the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was in the House I pointed out that it had been brought to my attention that there were very serious difficulties regarding the supervision of children in the care of the State in some areas. We read in newspaper reports yesterday and today that two very young girls in the care of health boards are pregnant. I do not know if these pregnancies occurred before the children went into the care of the State but there are serious difficulties in finding adequate and well-trained staff to supervise them. I have talked to the Minister of State outside the House too about this but I would like the Leader to invite him back so that we can address this very serious issue because if we take children into our care we all have a responsibility to ensure they are adequately supervised. I am very slow to criticise the health boards because they have serious problems trying to find staff to deal with these children. Nevertheless we must address the issue because they are some of the most vulnerable children in the State.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I support the proposal by Senators Norris and McCarthy for a debate on the report of the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. It is very important that we analyse this detailed report in the new year and hold a discussion with maybe an opportunity for the families to respond to the report, through the Seanad. I ask the Leader to provide for a detailed debate on this in the new year.

I was listening to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government yesterday and two Labour Party consultants suggested that one in 1,000 results might be inaccurate. As the advertising for the National Lottery says, "It could be you". There are over 1,000 candidates standing in the local elections and 500 candidates for the general election and such inaccuracy would be intolerable. We need clarity on this because it is far too serious in a democracy to have a hitch that might technically prevent a government taking power. It could have many very serious consequences. Even at a local level one inaccurate result would be wrong.Can the Leader also please organise a debate on the professions in the new term? This should refer particularly to monopolies, restrictive practices and self-governance.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	67	A commitment was given in the 2002 election on the Irish language. On the other side of the House Senator Ó Murchú is a persuasive advocate for the language but it is not recognised officially at EU level. We should keep our eye on the ball regarding a vote that is coming up at EU level at which we will have an opportunity to make Irish an officially recognised language. There are three important aspects to this issue. First, if an Irish applicant were to apply for a job at European level, he or she would need two languages. However, Irish is not recognised as a second language in that context and such an applicant would need to have French, Spanish, German or some other European language. Addressing this issue would present an employment opportunity for Irish citizens to work in Europe. Second, it is a matter of national pride that Irish should be recognised as an official language. We have been negotiating for such recognition since 1972. In 1972, under a Fianna Fáil-led Government, the ball was missed. Fianna Fáil is good at going back 30 to 40 years in regard to Fine Gael. In 1972, we had an opportunity to make the Irish language recognised at European level. I am not a politician who tends to go back that far—

In 1972 we missed the ball in this regard and we should not miss it again. There are up to 20 or 21 other recognised European languages and even accession states are being earmarked as countries whose languages will be recognised at European level. Is the Government not interested in the Irish language?

As I said on previous occasions, a debate on this issue would be helpful. I could return the compliment to the Senator on his advocacy of the Irish language. I have heard him contribute to debates in support of it on many occasions. It would be helpful if we could establish unanimity within the House on this issue. There is a case for Irish being recognised as an official language in European affairs.On another issue, the Taoiseach was correct in his comment on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings when he said, time does not dim the requirement for answers. Anybody watching the misfortunate families on television would have seen that their grief is still palpable. They are looking to us for protection and representation. The suggestion that in some way we should keep the lid on this horrific issue lest we might offend our nearest neighbour, Britain, is not tenable because it is a sovereign Government, subject to the requirements of compliance with human rights and international law.

As that report has shown, there are wide variations and huge discrepancies in the premiums quoted by various companies. As has been said by many speakers, including Senator Morrissey, shopping around is essential. It was good to hear Senator Morrissey's good news story, but many people would not be as versatile or as much on the ball as he was. I think the Tánaiste would like to take an interest in this, perhaps through some agency. It should not be the case in this small market that there is such wide discrepancy and variation. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate, as was called for, on this important subject, as well as bringing it to the attention of the Tánaiste.I support the many speakers, including Senator Hanafin, who raised a question about electronic voting. It is open to—

It was a sad occasion. It highlighted the indifference of our political leaders at the time to the suffering caused and to responding to the biggest single bombing at any time during the 30 years' war in the North. There needs to be a Hutton style inquiry before which people such as former Prime Ministers, Foreign and Justice Ministers will have to appear to explain why—

Files are missing in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is a serious matter.Last Friday in Dublin Castle the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, said that one of the priorities of the Irish Presidency will be driving the EU initiative on the reform of the United Nations. I said previously that we should have a debate on the reform of the United Nations. To me, the United Nations is a group of allies, but unfortunately the latest development in American imperialism of the current US Government is its declaration that it will not allow France, Germany and Russia to tender for contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq. The US Government is forbidding three members of the United Nations Security Council to tender for contracts worth some $18.6 million because they did not agree with its position on the war in Iraq.

I draw Members' attention to this latest development by the current Administration, which does not reflect the views of all American people or politicians. It is very serious and we cannot be indifferent to it. We cannot let it pass over our heads as happened in regard to other events. The subject of the Barron report was left to somebody else to get to the bottom of. We have to react.Halburton, the company of the United States Vice-President, Dick Cheney, is getting twice as much money per gallon of oil from Kuwait into Iraq—

The day of the long counts should not be allowed to continue. It is not a spectator sport for candidates.Senator Norris raised the matter of the Hospital Sweepstakes earlier in the week and I support what he said, but the Tánaiste provided a financial package to some of the workers. I have been making the same point for many years regarding farm labourers who worked under the Land Commission. The Leas-Chathaoirleach knows that in his own county and in County Cavan, parts of the Land Commission remain. There was an appalling situation for farm labourers who got virtually nothing when the Land Commission closed down. A committee of this House should consider a package for them, similar to what other workers received. I would like the support of the House in this matter. I hope we will have a debate in the House or that the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food would consider the matter.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I commend the patience of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.Senator Finucane, the acting leader of the Opposition, noted the report of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and asserted that Irish motorists are being fleeced due to the disparity in insurance rates. The Senator also raised the urgent issue regarding Filipino nurses whose spouses are not allowed Irish work permits and who must subsequently leave their nursing jobs because both partners cannot work. Such joint employment is possible for these people in Northern Ireland. Senator Finucane also noted that because of the changeover to the four year degree in nursing, there will be a year in which the colleges of nursing will have no graduate output. I am sure the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, are considering this matter.Yesterday was International Human Rights Day. Senator Norris spoke of the killing of children in Iraq and suggested we look at the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in the context of human rights. He and Senator McCarthy also raised the issue of electronic voting.The Barron report will be considered by a joint committee, some members of which sit in this House and will constitute a strong presence. Any Senator can attend joint committee hearings and any Senator who is a committee member can contribute as can attendees.

We can get further clarification if needed, but I understand that any Member of this House can attend the sub-committee meeting. It is important that as many of us as can attend do so, particularly on the days when evidence is being taken. I spoke to members of the Taoiseach's office who recommend that we do not discuss the matter in either Chamber of the House. I can speak only for this House. The Taoiseach does not recommend a discussion on the matter prior to the completion of the hearings and the issuing to both Houses of the report. We can then discuss the matter freely. I recommend that anyone who wishes to attend meetings of the sub-committee should do so, take notes and reflect on the matter. The bombings were dreadful. As Senator Ó Murchú said, time does not dim what happened, but rather accentuates it. Where do we go to next? This question was raised on "Morning Ireland" this morning in an excellent programme which presented every point of view. The course we take now is the business of the sub-committee, which will look into the matter comprehensively.As Senators Norris and McCarthy noted, the misgivings expressed by the committee considering electronic voting are justified. I hope the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, will address the issue in this House in the next session.Senator Morrissey brought good tidings of great joy prior to Christmas. His savings on his business and car insurance were amazing. We would like to hear later how he secured these rates.

The Senator also drew attention to the sad death from legionnaire's disease of a female patient in Waterford and asked that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, comment thereon.Senator Jim Walsh raised various issues including insurance rates, bank interest and loan rates, and price controls for the medical, dental and legal professions. He made the fair point that the non-productive segments of life are overwhelming the productive segments with costs. That is a fair point. Senator Walsh also asked if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could look into the compellability issue and he has made a formal request about this. Senator Henry noted the potential dangers for young children in care. The health boards act in loco parentis for all of us. I do not know the circumstances of the cases involving the two young girls mentioned by the Senator, or when and how they became pregnant. I will ask the relevant Minister to attend the House to provide some clarification of these sad events.Senator Leyden spoke of the Barron report. With his colleague Senator Feighan he also took up the cudgel on behalf of Boyle's claim as a town suitable for the decentralisation programme. Senator Leyden spoke of being muzzled but I will not go into that.

This House did great work on the insurance issue during this term, and we should take some credit. We had a very full debate on the matter. It was also raised during Private Members' business. We had before us the Tánaiste's Bill on the matter, which is only now going before committee. We worked hard to get the Bill before the House in order to debate it thoroughly and not be rushed into it in half a day's sitting next Thursday. We exercised our minds greatly on insurance matters and I hope the proof of that will be seen in the type of dramatic results Senator Morrissey has noted.Senator Hanafin commented on electronic voting and echoed Senator Walsh's call for a debate on the monopolies and restrictive practices of many professional bodies. The position of the Irish language in the EU was adverted to by Senators McHugh and Ó Murchú. The point made was a fair one. We regard Irish as our national language and it should be similarly regarded at EU level. As the Senators said, it is a matter of national pride.Referring to the Barron report, Senator Ó Murchú said we should not seek to brush matters under the carpet but bring them into the open, no matter who may be at fault. Senator Coghlan noted the substantial differences in insurance costs. Senator While called for a Hutton-style inquiry following the Barron report, as well as for a debate on the reform of the United Nations. She pointed out that only businesses in countries which supported the American war or invasion effort in Iraq are being allowed to seek the rebuilding contracts on offer there.Senator Glynn called for a debate on the proposed press council. We had a very good debate on that matter this week, and as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, attended the House just yesterday for three hours, I will not ask him to do so again in the near future. He spoke at the outset of the debate and at its conclusion, and made sound sense.Senator Glynn was very vehement on the subject of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I can only repeat again the wise advice I received from the Taoiseach's office.

Senators expressed a view that the postponement provisions were too restrictive in that they may only apply after the employee has availed of 14 weeks maternity leave, not less than four of which are taken after the date of confinement.During the debate on this issue the legal reasons behind this restriction were outlined. In view of the comments made, I understand the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, undertook to look at this matter again to see if anything could be done to improve the situation. Unfortunately, having examined the matter again, the situation is unchanged. European Court of Justice case law is categorical on this issue. In the case of Margaret Boyle and Others  v. the Equal Opportunities Commission, the European Court of Justice stated:Article 8 of Directive 92/85 provides that the period of maternity leave provided for therein must be at least 14 continuous weeks allocated before and/or after confinement.It follows from the purpose of that provision that the woman cannot interrupt or be required to interrupt her maternity leave, return to work and complete the remaining period of maternity leave later.In light of the provision of the directive and European Court of Justice case law, there is absolutely no discretion to make provision in national legislation for the postponement or splitting of maternity leave at any stage during the first 14 weeks of maternity leave or during the four weeks post-confinement period. Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment tabled by Senator Tuffy and her colleagues.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I thank the Minister of State for examining this issue. This is the third or fourth time we have received this advice from the Attorney General's office and from the EU Commission. If a child goes back into hospital before the mother has taken her 14 weeks maternity leave, the legislation takes away from her right to maternity leave. If the child is hospitalised the mother could go back to work for five or six weeks and resume her maternity leave afterwards. This provision minimises her rights.While I understand that it may not be possible to change the legislation to take account of that fact, the Minister should raise this matter in Europe so that the directive can be amended. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, observed during the debate on Second Stage that a right is not a right if no one wants it. We cannot make things less fair for women. That would be the case if a baby was in hospital for a number of weeks and the mother could not take maternity leave when he or she was discharged. She would than have to take parental leave, which she may want to use at a later stage in the life of her child. I urge the Minister of State and his Department to continue to fight this case at European level to ensure that women's rights are of benefit to us.

The amendment was proposed because the Minister of State, during the debate on Committee Stage, undertook to examine the matter again. I hope the matter can be reviewed before the Bill goes to the Dáil. If not, Senator Cox's suggestion that the matter be raised at European level is the right approach.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I second the amendment. Has the Minister looked at EU Directive No. 92/85 on pregnant workers? Where a mother or child falls ill during the maternity leave or the additional leave, it is unfair that the leave should be cancelled. She is then forced to use sick leave or parental leave.

In page 9, lines 17 and 18, to delete "(other than the last 3 classes in such a set)".It is wrong to exclude the right to leave for the last three antenatal classes. For example, if the last three classes are held before the employee takes maternity leave, she would not have the right to attend them. This is an unfair restriction.The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, stated that this is the arrangement negotiated with the employers. It seems to be an unfair restriction and goes against the spirit of the legislation. We ask the Minister of State to support the amendment and to remove the exclusion of the last three classes.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I second the amendment and I support it. I cannot understand why the last three classes are excluded. It does not seem to make sense, unless the Minister believes the mother will already be on maternity leave. I would like to hear the Minister's view. If the mother is still at work, she should be allowed attend all the classes.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Section 8 of the Bill seeks to implement the recommendations of the maternity working group on providing entitlement to attend antenatal classes. In the case of a pregnant employee, the Bill provides for time off from her work without loss of pay for the purpose of attending one set of antenatal classes other than the last three classes in such a set. As stated on Committee Stage, this recommendation is the result of a compromise between members of the working group.The implementation of the recommendation has a direct cost implication for employers. As part of the compromise reached during negotiations, employers' representatives agreed that the legislation should provide that employers pay employees for time off to attend a full set of antenatal classes except for the last three. Section 8 reflects this agreement. Time off to attend the remaining classes will be at the employee's own expense unless the employer agrees otherwise. This recommendation is part of a composite set of recommendations made by the maternity working group following negotiations between the social partners and Departments.I assure the House that these agreed recommendations were the result of considerable debate, negotiation and compromise reached between the members of the working group. Each of the participants made concessions to reach agreement on as many issues as possible so that the group could put forward a set of realistic and viable recommendations to significantly improve and strengthen the existing maternity protection legislation.I am of the view that to deviate from the group's recommendations would be a breach of the partnership process through which mechanism employment rights have been enhanced in many ways in recent years. I thank Senator Tuffy for raising this matter. However, for the reasons outlined, I cannot accept the amendment and I do not propose to make any changes to the provision in section 8 for attendance at antenatal classes.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I direct these remarks to the officials in the Department. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, undertook to examine this issue again and it is obvious that he has done so. However, the points raised on Second and Committee Stages are still valid and need to be reiterated. The Minister of State made a significant and very welcome change with regard to the timing of maternity leave by allowing women the choice to take only two weeks leave before delivery as opposed to the four weeks which was previously stipulated. That has created a change in the time women remain at work before they take maternity leave. Most antenatal classes take place in the latter two months of pregnancy. If that is the case, a woman is attending antenatal classes during the time she is still working. I made the point on Committee Stage that in the Western Health Board area, the set of antenatal classes provided by the board consists of four sessions in four weeks. This legislation discriminates against those women because the last three classes are not covered, that is, three quarters of the course is not covered.I understand ICTU and IBEC were very involved in the partnership approach to this legislation. If the issue was revisited by the working group there may be some solution which would not increase the cost by a significant amount. It is accepted practice that most employers pay for the entire time off to attend antenatal classes. That is the case in my business where women are never deducted the time off for attendance at antenatal classes, despite what is stipulated in the legislation. We must be very careful to ensure that this does not cause discrimination. I hope there will be an opportunity to examine this issue again before the Bill becomes law.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I fully support the views expressed by Senator Cox. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that one of the main provisions in the Bill is the provision for expectant mothers to attend one set of antenatal classes without loss of pay. I regard it as misleading if the legislation states that the mother cannot attend the final three classes of such a set. I ask the Minister of State to consider this issue further and to provide that a mother should be allowed attend the full set of antenatal classes.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I was indulgent and allowed Senator Terry to speak a second time in view of her interest in the topic. I invite Senator Tuffy to speak if she wishes.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I thank both Senators for supporting the amendment, which I intend to press because the point is sufficiently important. It seems so unnecessary to exclude the three classes. I can understand that employers might have concerns about the cost to their own businesses, but many employers would not deduct pay if a pregnant employee attended antenatal classes. It is in the interest of their businesses to facilitate expectant mothers and mothers generally as much as possible and, therefore, I wish to press the amendment.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 11, to delete lines 13 to 17.This amendment was also tabled on Committee Stage when we sought to oblige employers to provide facilities for breastfeeding in the workplace. This amendment does not go that far but we feel it is wrong to state that the employer does not have to provide such facilities. We had a detailed discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. It is obvious that it would be more difficult for employers to provide breaks for nursing mothers than to provide breastfeeding facilities. Employers should examine the possibility of providing such facilities. Section 8(1) introduces an unnecessarily negative tone since the legislation places no obligation on employers to provide breastfeeding facilities. If the particular subsection were absent, the legislation would be silent on the matter and, thus, there is no way the Bill could be interpreted as stating that employers are obliged to provide such facilities. Employers are obviously not so obliged because there are two alternatives. In light of this, subsection (1) should be removed. Legislation such as this Bill should aim to provide breastfeeding facilities for nursing mothers. It is in the interests of employers to provide such facilities, including crèches, which encourage family-friendly practices in the workplace and facilitate employment generally.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I second the amendment and support Senator Tuffy's remarks. The subsection is negative and lends nothing to the legislation. Its removal would render the Bill silent on the issue but its inclusion will mean that employers shall not be required to provide breastfeeding facilities. We are trying to encourage employers to provide such facilities, yet in this legislation we are telling them they do not have to do so. We are in the business of encouraging employers to provide all types of facilities for working mothers and parents generally, but this subsection strikes a negative tone. Its inclusion in the legislation will give a bad impression to employers that the Government is not encouraging or placing an onus on them to provide these facilities. It would be a good day's work if the amendment were accepted.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	137	As outlined on Committee Stage, the provisions contained in section 9(2) reflect the Supreme Court ruling on the Employment Equality Act 1996, that one can only place social obligations in the public interest on private property owners where no more than nominal costs will be incurred. The legal advice available to me is that it is necessary to use this particular construction in the Bill. Rather than removing a perceived negative aspect of the Bill, as suggested on Committee Stage, omitting the reference to nominal cost would remove the clarity this subsection adds, which is that the employer may not be required to spend more than a nominal amount on breastfeeding facilities in the workplace. Furthermore, the maternity working group, which had time to examine this issue in its entirety, recognised the necessity to include a reference to a nominal cost limitation and made explicit reference to this in its recommendation. While I thank Senator Tuffy for having raised the issue again, I cannot accept her amendment for the legal reasons I have outlined.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Amendment No. 10 is an alternative to Government amendment No. 9 and both may be discussed together by agreement.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The purpose of amendment No. 10 is for clarification. A similar amendment was tabled on Committee Stage but it has been changed to facilitate the Government because the current wording of the section goes beyond what it should. My understanding is that the way the section is currently worded means an employee who is breastfeeding and who has not taken advantage of the provisions of the section, would have to notify her employer in writing that she has ceased to breastfeed. I may be wrong but that is my reading of the section and, if this is so, it would be absurd. I know it is a matter of interpretation but that is the meaning of subsection (4) as it is currently framed. It should be amended by the deletion of the words "to whom subsection (1) applies" and the substitution of "who has exercised an entitlement under subsection (1)". In that respect, the obligation to notify the employer that breastfeeding has ceased would only apply if the employee had taken advantage of the provisions to apply for time off work or for breastfeeding facilities. I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on that point.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	140	My understanding is that Government amendment No. 9 addresses the issue Senator Tuffy has raised. In theory, therefore, it achieves what would be intended by the Labour Party's amendment No. 10.

I was prepared to accept the Senator's amendment but following consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I am advised that the wording she proposes requires a minor drafting alteration to adhere more closely to drafting convention. Consequently, I have moved this amendment to address the matter.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Government amendment No. 11 has already been discussed with Government amendment No. 2.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, for coming to the House to take the Bill. I realise this is the Final Stage and it is difficult to get a handle on it when one has not been involved from the outset. Generally, I am happy with the Bill. We have made improvements and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, for bringing forward those proposals.Overall, we still need to do much more for working parents, particularly working mothers, including mothers who are breastfeeding or those who have a very young child. It is extremely difficult to go out to work when one has a very young child and some mothers have more than one. We need to do everything in our power to assist parents in that position, make family friendly policies and have family friendly workplaces. Those facilities, particularly crèches, are still not available to parents. We, the Members of the Oireachtas, should be giving the lead to other companies and we are falling down by not giving that lead. It is essential that we provide a crèche in Leinster for the many parents – I speak for men and women – who work in these Houses. That would give a lead to the other Departments in this city and throughout the country which should provide such facilities. I am aware some local authorities are improving the position in that regard, but it is time we came into the modern world.We have encouraged women into the workplace, but we owe it to them to make their lives a little easier. Having a crèche in or adjacent to their workplace would make life much easier for parents and children because visits can be made at lunchtime and for breastfeeding purposes. I hope the Minister of State will consider that idea and use his influence to implement such a facility at the earliest possible opportunity.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the time, attention and interest they had in this area and the fact that they listened to all our comments. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said on Committee Stage that he enjoyed the debate. He should be commended because he took on board many of the suggestions made and came back with significant changes.I welcome the effect of debate on legislation in this House, which is the reason we are all here, particularly the parental leave legislation which was passed by this House. It was the input and suggestions of the female Members of the House that made a significant difference in terms of the practical issues. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who is substituting for him today.I am delighted Senator Terry addressed the issue of justice, equality and law reform because creating a framework of support and protection for women and children is vital. We are working to that agenda with the introduction of parental leave, etc, but many more initiatives need to be taken. In coming years I hope to see the provision of some form of parental leave payment. We have brought in parental leave, which is welcome, but we now need to provide for some form of benefit. As with maternity benefit, we should provide for parental leave benefit and I hope our social welfare system will support that in time.On the area of child care, the issue does not only involve crèches. Many proposals need to be brought to the table in the partnership type discussions that take place. Encouraging job sharing, for example, is a matter for the Department of Finance in terms of revenue taxation or whatever, but we need to put in place the structures and create tax incentives for companies to provide crèches, car parks and so on. I realise it is not an issue for that Department but there is no reason we cannot provide double allowances in terms of payment for job sharing. It is more expensive for employers to have two people doing one job. We need to recognise that in the taxation system and provide incentives. Nothing will incentivise an organisation more than the possibility of reducing costs to provide facilities. Job sharing and special hours for mothers are initiatives that make companies, organisations, semi-State and Government bodies more child friendly and they are vital.My main issue, for whatever length of time I remain in this House, is the question of maternity leave for politicians. I say again to the Minister and his officials, whom I know are sick listening to me although I make no apology for it, that until women Oireachtas Members at national level, local government members and those involved in politics at all levels have the right to appropriate maternity leave and to have their rights as politicians protected, and until regulations are introduced to allow them cast their votes while on maternity leave, we will never have true equality. That is what this is all about. If we do not believe in equality for the people who are running our country, we are fooling ourselves. There is no equality agenda.I have had two babies during my time as a Member of this House and on both occasions, on a point of principle and not because I would not have been facilitated – I have no doubt that would have been the case – I did not avail of a right that I did not have. That is not fair. If we are to have any type of equality, it has to start at the top as well as the bottom. I ask the Minister of State to take on board the thoughts we shared with him today in any discussions he might have. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, had the benefit of those on Second and Committee Stages, as did his officials.I hope that before I leave this House we might see some changes in this area. At that stage I might even be happy to retire and either not have any more babies or stay out of politics – I am not sure which – but I thank the Minister and his officials for their attention and hard work. I thank all the Senators for the progressive, informative and beneficial way we have worked together on this legislation. It is a proud day for this House and I am proud to be part of it.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I thank the Minister of State and I welcome the legislation, which is positive and represents progress. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and his officials for their work on the legislation. I also thank the Senators present for their contributions, including Senator Henry for her contribution earlier and Senator White for her contribution on the previous occasion. I particularly thank Senator Cox for all her work in this area over the years. She has a good deal of knowledge about the issue, much more than me.I want to pick up on the point made by Senator Cox about the need for further action in terms of women politicians. I agree with that but it has to be done in a broader context. It has to be about families, which I referred to on the previous occasion. It is not realistic for a woman politician to stop keeping up her profile because she has had a baby. There will be huge demands on her to continue her activities after she has had a baby. Obviously, maternity leave and benefit will be the priority but there should be some other form of leave available, based on maternity leave, which either the father or mother can take at various periods. It would be good, for example, if the husband or partner of a woman politician could take some leave during the period after the birth of a child as it would relieve some of the pressure on her. This is the next area which needs to be developed because we are a long way behind other European countries in terms of leave entitlements for fathers.We discussed the proposal for a crèche in Leinster House the other day and the issue was raised again this morning by Senator Terry. I made inquiries to ascertain what progress had been made on this proposal, which was supposed to form part of a larger plan to provide various facilities in Kildare House. I understand the matter is now up in the air. While I do not know if they were factual, suggestions were made to me when making inquiries that interest in a crèche facility was insufficient. This is not acceptable. The facility must first be provided before people will avail of it. Crèches should not be operated on the basis that children must always be present. Parents who wish to use the facility should be allowed to do so in the periods they require it.One does not often see children in Leinster House, yet there are many fathers and mothers employed here – obviously the number of fathers is higher. I am sure many of them would use a crèche facility if it were provided. Given the way in which Leinster House operates and that staff experience the same demands and must work the same hours as Members, the facility should be flexible and available to Members and staff. We should not allow this issue to be put on the long finger. I apologise for not being sufficiently prepared for this debate.Given that there is not much difference between amendments Nos. 9 and 10, the Government should have accepted my amendment. While I realise and welcome that it accepted the point the Labour Party was making in its amendment, it is as good for the Opposition as for the Government to have amendments accepted. It would have been a welcome gesture by the Government to accept my amendment and, given the similarity in wording, I do not understand the reason it did not do so. Despite this, I thank the Minister of State for accepting the point of my amendment.

I am pleased it was possible to accommodate on Committee Stage some of the issues raised by Senators on Second Stage regarding compulsory pre-confinement maternity leave and breastfeeding provisions.The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 represents a significant development in our maternity protection legislation. Its timing could not be better as it coincides with the highest ever participation of women in the workforce. I understand from recent figures released by the Central Statistics Office that the number of women at work last year was more than 678,000, an increase of nearly 175,000 on the 1996 census figures and more than twice that recorded in the 1981 census.The provisions of the Bill will, once enacted, strengthen and protect our maternity protection legislation and provide working women with greater flexibility in managing their individual circumstances and achieving a balance between their work and life commitments. I will take on board the points made about a crèche in Leinster House and examine what can be done.

Mr. Ó Neachtáin has represented the constituency of Connacht-Ulster in the European Parliament since July 2002. Prior to that he was well known as a local politician and for his commitment to working on behalf of Gaeltacht areas.

Tá sé de phribhléid agam ionadaíocht a dhéanamh ar thoghcheantar Chonnacht-Uladh agus tá mé ag dúil go mór le hionadaíocht a dhéanamh ar thoghcheantar i bhfad níos mó, ceantar an Iarthair agus an Tuaiscirt, a chuireann Condae an Chláir isteach le Connacht-Uladh.I thank the Members of Seanad Éireann for inviting me to talk about my work in the European Parliament and to discuss the future developments of the European Union from an Irish perspective. One of the ongoing issues of concern to many people is that it is difficult to explain what the institutions of the EU are doing. Inviting Members of the European Parliament to the Seanad to explain our work and our specific roles within the European Parliament is a constructive exercise. I hope this means there will be a greater level of interaction between Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Seanad into the future. This is important because Ireland's future rests politically and economically within an ever-expanding EU. Indeed, these are challenging times for the EU as it seeks to modernise its decision-making structures to accommodate the ten new member countries which are set to join the Union from 1 May next.Before speaking in detail about my work in the European Parliament, I have a few comments on the negotiations for the new EU treaty. In 1957 the European Economic Community was founded and decision-making procedures were put in place for a Community of the six founding member states. Now we live in a Community of 15 member states, comprising 375 million people, and in a little less than six months' time we will be living in a Community of nearly 500 million people. If the EU is to remain effective it must modernise its decision-making system.If there is agreement on a new EU treaty over the coming days another referendum will be held in Ireland. This is a legal requirement that has been in place ever since the Crotty judgment of the mid-1980s. This means we will be voting for the sixth time on a new EU treaty since 1987. This should be seen as an opportunity for a broader debate on the work of the EU's institutions and the role Ireland is playing within this evolving political and economic entity. However, I do not agree with the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, who recently stated that countries which did not support a new European treaty would have problems continuing their membership of the European Union. Mr. Prodi's warning shot to EU Governments and citizens is a highly unwelcome development and should be criticised in its entirety. It does not contribute one iota to the positive role of the debate that is taking place about the future of the EU.Much progress has been made on the need to ensure that the citizens of Europe fully understand how the Union carries out its business. Governments set up the structure of the EU Convention along the same lines as the National Forum on Europe in order that proposals could be brought to EU Governments about the future operation of the Union. I pay tribute to Senator Maurice Hayes for the important role he has played as chairman of the National Forum on Europe. EU leaders are meeting this week in Brussels to discuss the broader proposals for a new EU treaty. That does not mean that different Governments and people in Europe do not have concerns about certain proposals being discussed. I do not believe that taxation matters, for example, are best left as the preserve of individual member state governments and local authorities. I fully support the retention of the unanimity requirement for taxation decisions to be taken by the EU. It is not in the best interests of the citizens of Europe to allow the EU to take decisions on taxation matters through a majority voting system alone.We must recall that even now there are more than 50 different areas where the European Parliament has power of co-decision with the governments of the EU concerning a range of economic and social policy issues. The European Parliament has power of co-decision concerning environmental issues, social and employment matters, consumer protection, promotion of public health, allocation of Structural Funds, to name a few. In the context of the future make-up of European institutions, it is important that smaller member states are effectively represented at the top table of the European Commission. There must be equality of representation on the European Commission between smaller and larger member states. The European Commission is a very important institution and manages EU competition policy and many of the practical aspects of the running of the EU Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy.Within the European Parliament I serve on the fisheries committee and on the industry, external trade, research and energy committee. My membership of the fisheries committee has come at a time of reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, which is critical for the future of the Irish fishing industry and at a time when there is an unprecedented need to protect the interests of Irish fishermen, their families and the coastal communities to which they belong. The Common Fisheries Policy must be geared to keeping alive regions that depend on fishing rather than making it a battlefield between states. Fishermen share common interests. They all need fishery resources to carry on their activity. There are problems with fish stocks at this time. We have an obligation to be serious about fisheries conservation and sustainability of fish stocks. However, recovery plans for fish stocks cannot disregard the social and economic consequences. I regret the current unsatisfactory state of fish stocks and am in favour of conservation. Since day one I have been adamant that highly sensitive areas must be protected. This is particularly true of the fishing area known as the Irish Box. I had the privilege of being appointed rapporteur by the fisheries committee in the European Parliament on this sensitive issue of major importance to Ireland. Time and again I stressed that the area known as the Irish Box was a rich fishing area with a high concentration of juvenile fish and spawning grounds. I stressed it was critical that the EU applied restrictions on fishing efforts within the area and vital that the Irish Box be maintained as the biologically sensitive zone in the interests of sustainability of stocks.Earlier this year the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted for my amendment, detailing the need to protect the Irish Box, by a massive majority. In so doing it voted to protect the legitimate interests of Irish fishermen. I have insisted continually that fishermen and their representative organisations must be allowed greater participation and involvement in the decision making process of the Common Fisheries Policy.In the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the European Commission has finally agreed that fishermen and their organisations must and will be more involved in the future. I welcome the proposal from the European Commission to create regional advisory councils which will include fishermen and their organisations for the first time in the decision making process. The European Parliament has now been formally invited to draw up a report and give its opinion. Once again the fisheries committee has nominated me to draft the report on this important matter. I will consult widely with fishermen and their organisations before drafting my report.The setting up of the regional advisory councils is a constructive policy issue and must be supported. It can only be successful if it is properly financed and resourced. As a member of the industry, external trade, research and energy committee of the European Parliament I deal with a wide ranging set of policy issues, which are implemented at EU level, concerning the operation of commerce in the European Union. At present the European Parliament together with the European Commission and the EU governments are working strenuously to implement the Lisbon agenda. This agenda aims to make the EU the most competitive region in the world by 2010. To ensure the European Union becomes the most competitive and knowledge-based economy in the world, there must be investment in human capital, innovation, research and development. The advancement of the Lisbon process has also been rightly set out as a key priority for the Irish Government during the forthcoming Presidency of the European Union.Specific attention must be devoted to the needs of innovative small businesses in peripheral regions. One area of particular interest relates to the future operation of the telecommunications industry in Ireland and in the European Union. We live in a new information society where peripherality need not be a drawback. If the right infrastructure is put in place, notably broadband, and if adequate investment is made in providing skills training, regions such as the west and north-west can compete on a more equal basis with central locations. The benefits of new and evolving technology, such as broadband are more important now than ever to the Government given that the Minister for Finance has announced his plans to decentralise many Government offices. My constituency of Connacht-Ulster is an Objective One region and will continue to be until 2006.I urge the Government to ensure between now and 2006 that the counties which have Objective One status are guaranteed a package of financial incentives for new industries setting up in these regions. The western and north-western regions of Ireland were accorded Objective One status in an effort to ensure balanced regional development is promoted. If Objective One status is to be successful, we must ensure that a new infrastructure, a modern telecommunication network, is put in place in these areas in order that indigenous and foreign direct investment can locate in the west and north-west.I also take a particular interest in agricultural issues. The Common Agricultural Policy is still more important to Ireland per capita than any other member state. I have regular contact with farming organisations in Ireland. Recently I have had particularly close contact with farming organisations concerning the latest changes introduced on the future operation of the Common Agricultural Policy. I welcome the Government's decision that all direct payments for cattle and sheep premia be fully decoupled from production as and from 1 January 2005. Decoupling will present a clear opportunity to eliminate red tape which has been too much to the forefront of the practical implementation of the CAP in recent years. Decoupling is a big change for Irish farmers but it is one that will bring much needed stability and economic security to the sector which, in recent years, has experienced much uncertainty. In addition, farmers will be free to focus more sharply on the market and on the demands of the consumer. In turn, this will provide a firmer basis for a competitive food industry. The shift in focus of the EU Common Agricultural Policy towards the needs of the small farmer is a welcome development.I represented the European Parliament at the WTO talks in Mexico. While, unfortunately, no deal was reached it is important that rules are agreed at a multilateral level for trading operations. The talks are of great significance to us in Ireland. We export 90% of the beef produced here and as a result we have a real interest in ensuring that an orderly set of rules is in place to govern trading relations between different countries.I stated at the beginning of my contribution that these are challenging times for the European Union. However, it is fair to say they are exciting times as well. We look forward to Ireland assuming the Presidency of the European Union in January, which presents us with a challenge of overseeing the enlargement of the Union. It is a great opportunity for us to market our country on the international stage. Enlargement is an opportunity for us to strengthen our links with the ten new countries joining the European Union. New markets for Irish exports in these countries will guarantee more jobs at home.Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom lua go bhfuil tábhacht mhór ag baint le caomhnú ár gcultúir agus ár dteanga.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I welcome Mr. Ó Neachtáin to the Chamber. It is very clear that since becoming an MEP he has immersed himself in all sections and aspects of the European institutions. He will certainly be an MEP again after the elections at the end of June next year. He talked at length about how he is protecting Irish fishermen and their representative organisations and agricultural policy for the west. I will leave it to my colleagues from that area to ask questions on those aspects.He referred to taxation in his presentation but does he see any problems arising on this issue as we near completion of the draft constitutional treaty? Is there a danger that the concept of subsidiarity may be diluted in the context of taxation? The public is concerned about this issue.Will the European institutions be able to cope with the problems posed by the diversity of location, language, culture and economies when the Union enlarges to 25 members? We are doing everything in our power to inform the electorate about the workings of the institutions and we appreciate the role of MEPs and their communication with us. I am grateful to the Leader for organising these visits of MEPs to the Chamber because they give us an insight into the workings and complications of the institutions. It is easy for us to live in another world and not to reach out to the citizens of Europe, but we are reaching out in the National Forum on Europe, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, and through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. There is no substitute, however, for the presentations here. In preparation for the constitutional treaty referendum this visit is a golden opportunity for us to reach out to the public. I wish Mr. Ó Neachtáin every success in his campaign.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I join in welcoming Mr. Ó Neachtáin. I presume it is his first time addressing the Oireachtas and his contribution has impressed us. He has been a good pupil to learn so much so soon. Politics notwithstanding, we wish him well in the remaining months of his term and hopefully onwards from there.His constituency, formerly Connacht-Ulster and soon to be Ireland-West, is the most peripheral region of the European Union and has always suffered from various degrees of disadvantage. It has also benefited greatly from Ireland's membership of the Union and there has been a very significant transfer of funds into Mr. Ó Neachtáin's European constituency. He noted that Objective One status remains until 2006 but in the coming years, as we see beginning already, Ireland will go from being a net beneficiary of European aid to being a net contributor. What impact will that have on his constituency? He mentioned the forthcoming constitutional treaty referendum. In recent years we have had several European referenda and, for better or for worse, one of the issues highlighted was that Ireland had benefited so strongly economically from the net influx of funding. Mr. Ó Neachtáin's constituency is home to many people who would be concerned that the impact of the new Europe and the new financial arrangements might disadvantage them further. What type of impact will that have on a forthcoming treaty referendum in his area when people become aware of our new role in Europe and the new financial commitments we must make? Will it be a negative impact?I commend him on his efforts on behalf of the fisheries industry. I am a rather distant observer of the politics of Connacht-Ulster, but I can see that through his commitment to it he is strongly associated with the industry. Looking back on our entry to Europe in 1973, all sides now concede that to a degree we neglected fisheries. In his work as a rapporteur to the fisheries committee in the European Parliament is he able only to stem the tide or is there any realistic prospect of trying in some way to redress the balance? In other words, is his job a case of preventing a worsening of the situation or is it possible to improve the livelihood of our fishermen and is there any way in which more people can be attracted into the industry?What is Mr. Ó Neachtáin's view of the Parliament as a political institution? Does he feel that he has a role and that people are listening in such a large forum? Here and across the country we feel very distant from the politics of Europe and from those of the European Parliament. What type of role can he play as an MEP from a small country? Is it an effective role that allows him to make a point and to have that point and argument taken on board by the higher powers in Europe?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I thank Mr. Ó Neachtáin for coming here. At the end of his speech he mentioned his belief in the Irish language as a national identifier, particularly within Europe. This morning we had a small debate on that issue involving three or four members who said that while we recognise it as our national language, in Europe it is not so recognised. The present incumbent in the Chair, Senator Ó Murchú, has spoken to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, about it. Can Mr. Ó Neachtáin see how this might develop in the future and how we should go about ensuring that the language is given the significance in Europe which we ascribe to it?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I welcome Mr. Ó Neachtáin to the House and thank him for his thoughtful and stimulating address. He follows in a long line of illustrious former Members of the European Parliament who were appointed following the resignation of a Member of the European Parliament. I am thinking of Chris O'Malley who was appointed when Richie Ryan was appointed to the Court of Auditors and Des Geraghty who was appointed when Proinsias De Rossa resigned.What is Mr. Ó Neachtáin's perception of the way in which we appoint a Member when a Member of the European Parliament resigns? Does he consider the manner of such appointments is a handicap? It clearly is, given that he was not elected in the popular sense of that term. Does he consider that is the way to proceed or that it should be done by way of a by-election, as would happen if a Member of the Dáil was to resign? We have such debates on Europe on a regular basis, but I am interested in Mr. Ó Neachtáin's perception in this regard.I wish to follow up on a point made by Senator Bradford. Mr. Ó Neachtáin has been a Member of the European Parliament for some months and he is one of 600 such Members. While the two biggest groupings, the Social Democrat grouping, and our grouping, the Christian Democrats, divide the house in terms of their numbers, is it his perception that being a member of a smaller grouping gives him influence as an Irish Member of the European Parliament? Do his colleagues act in a party or a country sense? I have put this question to other Members of the European Parliament. I would be interested to get his perception of that issue. When candidates are elected to the European Parliament there is a view that they simply act in accordance with their broader European party grouping or is it the case that Members very much respond to their national calling? As a member of a minority grouping in the European Parliament, does he believe that within that group he has influence to make an impact on behalf of his constituents?
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I join in welcoming Mr. Ó Neachtáin and compliment him on the great work he has done, particularly in the agricultural area and in fisheries. He is an MEP for Connacht-Ulster. I hope the people of Clare will not let him down next year in the newly realigned constituency in which it will be difficult for Members to retain their seats. He will need the physical health he has to represent the people there.I was delayed at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and missed the start of Mr. Ó Neachtáin's address. At that meeting we talked about the landslide in Derrybrien in south Galway. As the late Tip O'Neill used to say, all politics is local and I suppose European politics is also local. Members of the Derrybrien group asked me if our MEPs could examine the environmental aspects of the landslide in Derrybrien and take up the matter with the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Ms Margot Wallström. I urge that this be examined. I support windfarms, as do the people of Derrybrien, but they do not want them located on top of slippery mountains. That landslide is a good marker for any other developments that might take place in that area.Mr. Ó Neachtáin mentioned the Border, midland and western region. We got Objective One status on the basis of information we had regarding the west and monitoring development in that area should be continued.Tá ceist amháin eile agam faoin teanga. Fáiltím an méid a dúirt Seán Ó Neachtáin mar gheall uirthi. Fuair mé litir ó Chonradh na Gaeilge a dúirt go mbeadh 20 teanga oifigiúil ag an Aontas tar éis Bealtaine an bhliain seo chugainn. Ba mhaith liom fiafraí, cosúil leis an Cheannaire anseo, cén fáth nach mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil an bhliain seo chugainn? Cén fáth nach féidir é sin a dhéanamh? An bhfuil sé praiticiúil é sin a dhéanamh? Sin iad na ceisteanna atá agam. Mo mhíle bhuíochas aríst don Fheisire Eorpach, Seán Ó Neachtáin.

Is mian liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis as ucht bheith ina Bhall de Phairlimint na hEorpa le bliain go leith anois freisin. Chun an fhírinne a rá, tá clú agus cáil bainte amach aige. Dár leis na tuairiscí, bíonn sé an-ghnóthach sa Pharlaimint ar son na tíre agus ar son mhuintir Chonnachta agus Uladh.

Mar sin, tá cúpla ceist agam.Maidir leis an mbunreacht nua – ceist a d'ardaigh Baill eile cheana féin – atá á chur le chéile nó á reachtáil i láthair na huaire, cad iad na deacrachtaí, na dúshláin agus na deiseanna is mó don tír seo i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta, polaitíochta agus sóisialacha taobh amuigh díobh sin atá luaite ag an Fheisire? Mar a dúirt an Ceannaire agus an Seanadóir Kitt, sheas an Feisire an fód i gcónaí ar son na Gaeilge, nó ar son na Gaeltachta, mar a dúirt an Cathaoirleach. Tá díomá in Éirinn nach bhfuil stádas oifigiúil á thabhairt don Ghaeilge sa bhunreacht nua atá le cur le chéile nó á chur le chéile i láthair na huaire. Tá díomá orainne. Cad iad na cúiseanna atá taobh thiar den chinneadh sin, más cinneadh atá ann? Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé glactha fós, ach tá sé beagnach ina chinneadh. An féidir an cinneadh sin a athrú roimh chríochnú agus fhoilsiú an bhunreachta, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Kitt? Munar féidir, cad ina thaobh nach féidir?Dúirt an Feisire go raibh meas aige ar an éagsúlacht agus gurb é tríd an éagsúlacht a thiocfadh an t-aontas.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	158	A number of Members are offering and I would like to give everyone an opportunity to speak. Members are aware of the time constraints, although that is no reflection on the previous speaker. I will call on Mr. Ó Neachtáin to respond to the questions and we must conclude this segment at 2 p.m. I call Senator Moylan.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I welcome Mr. Ó Neachtáin and compliment and congratulate him on his work as an MEP. My experience of having served with him on the Committee of the Regions in Europe was that he was committed and dedicated to what was best for this country.I listened to some MEPs speak here about the raft of legislation with which they are dealing that will affect this country. Does Mr. Ó Neachtáin consider that members of the Committee of the Regions, who are members of local authorities and represent local authority areas, could play a role in regard to legislation and directives, which, when transposed into Irish law, have caused major problems in certain areas? I refer in particular to the wildlife habitats directive, an impact of which was that some areas were designated as NHAs and SACs without sufficient consideration being given to the concerns of the landowners affected. I mention in particular areas where certain farmers had substantial areas of eskers with gravel in them, which were rezoned and which has left them almost useless financially for those concerned. Perhaps Mr. Ó Neachtáin would comment on this as it has been a very serious concern for many people. This was people's pension and the future for their families in terms of financial gain at a later date. With the stroke of a pen in Europe, by means of a directive, that disappeared.The constituency I represent, Laoighis-Offaly, got into the BMW region as part of it is included in the disadvantaged area. Any assistance Mr. Ó Neachtáin MEP could offer to the disadvantaged BMW region would be appreciated.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I join my colleagues in welcoming Mr. Ó Neachtáin, MEP, to the House, particularly as County Clare becomes part of the north-west constituency for the next election. Mr. Ó Neachtáin does not currently have to represent Clare, yet he does so and has spent a considerable length of time in the county over the past few months. He has been very effective there.The WTO talks have been of considerable concern to farmers in west Clare. Notwithstanding the changes made in the mid-term review, concern continues among farmers as a result of the WTO talks and their collapse in Cancún. Mr. Ó Neachtáin was a delegate at those talks and he might give us his views later on what he thinks the outcome may be. There are clear concerns about who the Commissioner might be and what other elements may arise for discussion.I wish Mr. Ó Neachtáin well in his endeavours. Considering his understanding and his great ability, I have no doubt he will find it relatively easy to be re-elected. As Senator Moylan pointed out, Mr. Ó Neachtáin has a considerable amount of experience in Europe through his membership of the Committee of the Regions. It has struck many people with whom I have come into contact that during his visits to Clare, Mr. Ó Neachtáin has shown a good grasp and understanding of the issues and is able to deal with them.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I warmly welcome Mr. Ó Neachtáin. I will pose a more political question. The number of Irish MEPs is to be reduced from 15 to 13. It is even more important in those circumstances that we are able to punch above our weight. We are currently fortunate in that one of our MEPs is President of the European Parliament. The group in which our MEPs operate is one of the smaller groups but is part of what one might call a coalition majority and, as we know domestically, smaller groups can exercise just as much influence as larger groups.Various people in this and other countries will be putting forward Eurosceptic views. They will be opposed to the EU constitution; they probably opposed every previous EU treaty. Every country has battles to fight inside the European Union, but considering those who are prepared to fight battles from within, Mr. Ó Neachtáin, MEP, might reflect on whether there would be any advantage to Ireland in having more Eurosceptics elected North and South, where they would find themselves and whether it is really easy for people like that who are not committed to the European project to exercise worthwhile influence on behalf of Ireland.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak. I am pleased to see in the House my colleague, Mr. Ó Neachtáin, MEP, who comes from what is now being somewhat strangely referred to as "the west". I apologise for not being in the House when Mr. Ó Neachtáin arrived. I was attending a meeting of the National Forum for Europe, which I know Mr. Ó Neachtáin would also have been attending but for his commitment in the Seanad.I endorse what I heard outside the Chamber and since I entered. I have no doubt that the hard work Mr. Ó Neachtáin has been doing will bring returns. That work is not necessarily exclusively in the public eye, but among potential voters and indeed within the Fianna Fáil party, if I may make that political point following the political point made by my colleague, Senator Mansergh. I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil initially, and then hopefully the wider electorate, will respond positively to the very significant contributions, especially in the fisheries area, made by Mr. Ó Neachtáin since he became an MEP. The fisheries area has no doubt been touched on. It was one where in effect, Mr. Ó Neachtáin singlehandedly fought the Irish case very well. Those of us who know him would not have been surprised at the manner in which he was able to network in that area as a result of his experience as a member of the Committee of the Regions.I will pose a question which is perhaps in the same family of questions to which Senator Mansergh's query belongs. Within the European Community or among its parliamentarians, does Mr. Ó Neachtáin have any sense that this great European project is stumbling? I will not say faltering, but stumbling. A deep cynicism now exists among the people of Europe. My colleague, Senator Ormonde, has regularly noted in this House and in the National Forum on Europe that – if I have correctly interpreted her remarks – we are moving beyond the people and need to return to them. The Euro-barometer statistics published in the past two days indicated a very deep anti-European Union feeling, if not a Eurosceptic feeling, although Ireland and Luxembourg scored highly in the mid to high seventies in terms of approval for the EU. It is interesting that these are two small countries. That may be significant. As an MEP, is Mr. Ó Neachtáin getting a sense of all this in his dealings with other groupings and EU parliamentarians? I do not know the answer, but it seems there is a separation in that a European intellectual elite operates within the constitutional process, while other people are left outside.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I know it will be quite a challenge for Mr. Ó Neachtáin, MEP, to respond in less than ten minutes to the fine and relevant questions asked.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Go raibh maith agaibh, a chairde, agus gabhaim buíochas do na Seanadóirí ar fad a chuir ceisteanna. I will try to respond to the questions as far as possible.Senator Ormonde raised the taxation issue. As I said there should be unanimity on taxation because it is at the core of the scepticism referred to by Senator Mooney. The feeling is that Europe may get ahead of itself in dealing with issues which are not in the broader EU remit, issues best left to individual member states. When the agreement in Laeken put together a convention, it was clearly stated that it should differentiate between the competences best looked after at European level and those best dealt with at national level. As we currently know it, Europe is only in its embryonic stage of development. In a very short time it has managed to arrive at a level appreciated by the people of Europe. It is very important, however, that Europe would not rush ahead into competences that do not belong to it at this stage. With agreement, that may broaden in the future. On taxation and on other issues which are of concern to member states, there must be consensus.I have been struck by the effort being made to bring about conciliation and consensus. All legal progress in Europe contains within it the bringing together of different opinions and we are capable of doing it. That format must remain for the foreseeable future. Otherwise we will go too close to the apprehension of the early part of the last century when Europe descended into the turmoil and devastation of two world wars. If Europe has learned anything, it is to be on the side of consensus and conciliation and to move forward on that level. The institutions of the European Union need to be revised and their legal base broadened to cope with enlargement. On a practical level, I believe that will happen.Senator Bradford spoke about Connacht-Ulster as a peripheral region and about the future of Objective One status. When the current Objective One agreement concludes in 2006, I hope there will be a transition period, as we now have for the south and east. It would be a mistake to go from a situation of positive support to one of no support. There should be a continuation along current lines. That decision has not been made yet, but I hope it will be a favourable one.We did not cover ourselves in glory with regard to the fisheries agreement. The fishery spoils were divided in accordance with the stakeholders' ability to fish and we accepted that at the time. Relative stability was accepted and we must live with it. Nevertheless, every time our Minister goes to a fisheries summit in Brussels, he comes back with an enhanced performance. I was encouraged by the recent vote in the European Parliament in Strasbourg which showed that MEPs are on the side of conservation. They realise the danger to sustainability of fish stocks and they want to continue the efforts to improve the fishing industry. The Spanish delegation, of course, tried to block my amendments to maintain the Irish Box as a conservation area.Senator Brian Hayes asked whether a small group has influence in the Parliament. The Union for Europe of the Nations put forward those amendments and we got support across the political front. Members of the European Parliament do not work primarily as individuals or as members of their groups. All MEPs think in national terms. The Spanish did so when they broke the whips of their respective political groups. That is encouraging. We are not tied to a political group. We can go out and garner support individually. Early in my European parliamentary career I was encouraged by the vote of 3 June 2003. It was an example of what can happen.The Parliament allows one to make a positive approach. We have the same opportunity as any of the 632 Members. I am encouraged by the willingness to allow for each shade of opinion. We work within our political groups, even within small political groups, and encourage support from other groups. There are many factions within the bigger groups, such as the socialists and the Christian Democrats, and we can find common ground with them at all times. I have been encouraged by the way the Parliament works. It is democratic and I praise it for being so. The political system gives one an opportunity to express one's opinion.Senator O'Rourke raised the question of the recognition of the Irish language. From the beginning the status accorded to the Irish language was not sufficient. Irish is an official language of the European Union, but not a working language. That was not highlighted until the ten new member countries demanded that each of their languages would be a working language. Malta has requested that Maltese, with a speaking population of 300,000, be a working language. There is no benefit in returning to the mistakes of the past but if we were now entering the European Union, we would certainly demand that our language be a working language of the Union. If our Government demands that status for Irish it will be forthcoming. That is the solution and it will be important for our ethos and for our future aims for Europe. Diversity is the basis of unity in Europe. This is an encouraging aspect of the European project.

The list system is different in other member states but it deals with the appointment of a replacement if a Member resigns. I am happy that it has been statutorily approved.

I visited Derrybrien. The mistakes made there must be acknowledged and I hope they will be.I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his words as Gaeilge. I think I have answered the questions on the teanga raised by him and Senator Kitt. I will always support the Committee of the Regions. It is where I got my European political training. I am encouraged by balanced regional development. The Committee of the Regions should be used in matters such as the habitats directive. It is a pity the habitats directive was not discussed publicly before decisions were made.When one signs on in Europe, one does not really have a chance to revisit a decision. It is therefore important and forms part of the new treaty that this is discussed at local, regional and national level before it becomes an implemented part of European policy.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	171	On behalf of Seanad Éireann I welcome Ms Avril Doyle, MEP, to the House. Ms Doyle was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 to represent the constituency of Leinster. She has extensive political experience. She entered local politics in June 1974 and became a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1982. She is a familiar figure to the Members of Seanad Éireann, having been elected on the agricultural panel in 1989 and in 1997.During her term as a Member of Dáil Éireann she was Minister of State at the Department of Finance, with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and the environment from 1986 to 1987. She was Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Transport, Energy and Communications from 1994 to 1997. She has also been a very formidable and effective shadow spokesperson on agriculture, the marine and the environment. She is an eloquent and well-briefed speaker and we look forward to hearing her address the House. I believe Ms Doyle always fancied being in the Minister's chair in Seanad Éireann.

I wish to inform the Leas-Chathaoirleach that I was in this chair as Minister of State on many occasions. Those Members who have served as Ministers of State will be aware of the "rent a Minister syndrome" as I termed it. When the Cabinet Minister was not available, some unsuspecting Minister of State would be grabbed, a brief thrust in his or her hand and he or she would be sent to the Seanad with orders to sort them out.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I changed that when I was a Minister of State because I thought it rather disrespectful to this esteemed Chamber.I am delighted to be back and I thank the Cathaoirleach for the invitation to address the House. I recognise and accept that I am not much of a novelty in this House; it is little over a year since I departed this hallowed Chamber. I always enjoyed my time in the Seanad and I always enjoyed the debate in Seanad Éireann. I acknowledge that Dáil Éireann is the seat of power but in terms of quality of debate or debating specific policy issues or parsing, analysing and teasing out legislation, this House wins hands down in terms of the work done. I say that with a little bit of experience behind me.I was three times a Member of the Dáil, twice a Minister of State in two different Governments, twice a Member of this House and am now a Member of the European Parliament. I have experience of all sides of the publicly elected democratic process.I have been a Member of the European Parliament since 1999 in the EPP group, which is the largest single political grouping in Europe. The group has approximately 230 members although this number fluctuates occasionally as members come and go. In a Parliament of 624 members, a by-election or a changing of personnel is not unusual. Four or five changes occur every month. Many MEPs in continental Europe are called back to national parliaments. The list system means that an election is not required for them to be recalled. They are brought back at the whims of various political masters and there is a constant turnover in the number of seats in all the political groups. It is more obvious in the larger groups.The four Fine Gael MEPs and Rosemary Scallon are members of the EPP group. For my sins, I am leader of the Irish delegation in the EPP group in the European Parliament. I am therefore involved in another layer of meetings and official processes. It was a very steep learning curve because I knew very little about Europe. I barely knew what EPP-ED meant and how it related to the other parties in the Parliament. After four and a half years, I am now familiar with the process. It takes at least a year to get one's feet under the table and to understand how such a significant project, the European project, can work democratically.Draft directives and proposals from the College of Commissioners go to the relevant committee for first reading. They are debated and amended or rejected there and sent on to the full plenary session for the vote. They are first examined by the political group to determine what will be the political stance. It is similar to the Whip system in the political parties in the Houses of the Oireachtas. My group does not have a very strict Whip system but each political group takes a position before the first reading in plenary session. Following a plenary vote, a proposal is sent to the Council of Ministers. Where there is co-decision on legislation, the Parliament has equal say with the relevant Council of Ministers on the outcome. Where there is no co-decision, the Parliament is still consulted and the measure is still debated at committee. It can be amended and rejected but without co-decision, the Council of Ministers has the complete say on the final shape of the legislation or directive.Agriculture has virtually no co-decision mechanism and this is a significant lack. I am a substitute member of the agriculture committee, together with my colleague, Mr. Liam Hyland, MEP, who is also a substitute member. I suppose it makes its own statement that for the first time in years there is no Irish full member of the agriculture committee.

We work like full members and we are always present when critical issues are being discussed. We take note of issues of particular interest to Ireland. We may not follow the debates on olive oil, cotton and tobacco and other such products, but when it comes to agricultural issues pertaining to the northern hemisphere, we are both extremely active. As rapporteur, I have had many reports from the committee.I am a member of the environment, public health and consumer affairs committee and this is my main committee. Other MEPs may have explained this process to the House.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Every MEP, when elected, must choose membership of a number one and a number two committee. All the work of the MEP is then honed through those committees. One only works on the tranche of legislation that comes to that committee from the Commission. One can discuss it with one's political group and when discussing the business of other committees in plenary session, but the working week comprises one's specific committee duties. Thus, the work is very much committee oriented and from that one gathers a general body of expertise in particular areas. I have been involved in many environmental issues, including the EU's framework water directive. I batted virtually single-handed to obtain the derogation for Ireland on domestic water rates. It is very hard to get our European colleagues to understand why nobody pays for domestic water supplies in Ireland. It is difficult to defend on environmental grounds or on the basis of any other sustainable argument one may wish to make. I had to explain what a political issue it is for us here; how Dáil seats have been won and lost over water rates and how Governments have come and gone on that basis alone.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	184	That is right.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Political considerations have to be weighed up with all the other arguments and in the long term it will be hard to sustain the defence of our position. At the time the framework water directive was going through the European Parliament, it was still a big political issue for Ireland but that will lessen in time and there will be a greater understanding that there is no such thing as a free lunch. There will be an acceptance that service charges generally comprise a payment for services, as distinct from taxation contributions to the central Exchequer to run the country. I know there are difficulties with refuse collection charges and various other issues – although not in my constituency, I might say – which form part of the same debate.My work is done through the European Parliament's environment, public health and consumer affairs committee. My group, the EPP, which is the largest in the Parliament, has 22 members on that committee. The seats on each committee are filled according to the d'Hondt system devised by a Belgian mathematician. The system ensures that relative to the number of seats, or votes in some cases, one gets one's share on each committee. The number of committee seats is very carefully worked out and offered on the d'Hondt system, including for delegations and trips abroad. My group gets most of the seats as it is the largest, while the Socialist group is the second largest, followed by the Liberals. There are six political groupings and one technical group in the European Parliament.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	186	How many members are on the environment, public health and consumer affairs committee?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Approximately 60, of which the EPP has 22. Mr. Jim Fitzsimons and Patricia McKenna are also on it. That committee is the most active in terms of the number of hours it sits and the amount of legislation with which it deals. The committee services all the proposals from DG5 under Commissioner David Byrne. In the last four years, he has proposed 90 legislative proposals concerning food, so I have had much interaction with him. There is an interesting working dynamic because, while a Fianna Fáil-PD Government represents the majority result in the last general election, in the European Parliament we have no government or opposition, just the different groups. I am member of the largest political group. Therefore, if the Government, departmental officials or the permanent representatives want to achieve something of particular Irish interest, they must have the EPP group on board in order to have the critical mass of votes on plenary stage. As leader of the Irish delegation in the EPP group, I do a lot of tick-tacking with Government officials and the permanent representatives who represent different Departments. There is, therefore, an interesting Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael dynamic that is not obvious initially.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Yes.

If I can persuade my colleagues, however, in theory I can bring 232 votes, although nobody ever brings their entire group along and, in any case, there is never a full attendance. The average plenary attendance is 525 out of a total of 624, due to absences through illness and for other reasons.

Much as I would like to pretend otherwise, none of my European colleagues can really understand the difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. I have tried to explain it and I am fairly vigorous in my efforts. It is difficult, however, to try to explain how we organise our political system to European politicians who have a right-left divide in their politics. I am sure some Senators have experienced that over the years.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I am interested in Seán Lemass, who was against neutrality. He is rather an interesting person if one investigates what he said on the record.I will provide a practical example of how the dynamic works between the permanent representatives, the officials and the Government in order to get things done in Europe by co-decision. We have had a huge battle over the veterinary medicines directive, which is part of a pharmaceutical package together with the human medicines directive and regulation on the EU Medicines Evaluation Agency, which is located in London and maintains law and order in this area. I am sorry to say that, yesterday, at COREPER, the Council of Permanent Representatives, we lost our Irish position on veterinary medicines. There will be a vote next Wednesday in Strasbourg but we will not have any success with it.At European Council level, the Minister for Health and Children is leading this package because human medicines will be the lead directive. Notwithstanding the gallant efforts of our permanent representatives out there and the officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food here, we had very little support to continue with our veterinary regime in this country, which has been superb. The British, who basically have the same regime, supported us. The Dutch and Portuguese said they would support us at the Council of Ministers but did not speak up, while the Swedes traded our support on an environment amendment for backing us on the issue of prescription-only medicines. From 2006 onwards, all veterinary medicines in Ireland will need a prescription. It is a serious animal welfare issue because a ewe would not be worth the cost of calling out a vet plus the prescription and veterinary medicines involved. Therefore, because they cannot afford to do otherwise, farmers will leave such matters until the last minute or will destroy the sick animal themselves since it would not be worth the cost of the treatment involved. There are all sorts of other issues, including iodine for the navel and teat dips, which are simple, routine farm medicines as distinct from antibiotics and steroids which are only available on prescription and will remain so. There is no argument about the latter type of drugs but the routine animal husbandry we all use will have to be obtained on prescription from 2006.The Department of Agriculture and Food did its best, battling valiantly on this issue in which I was very much involved, but it will now have to change our veterinary culture. Domestic law will have to be changed in this area. We will have to do what the French have done, even though they fought a hard battle against this change. The French have a system whereby the vet makes an annual call and provides a script to farmers who can then do what they like for the year. I do not understand how that can be in the best interests of the food chain, compared to our strictly regulated position whereby a veterinary prescription is only given on case by case basis following a clinical diagnosis. While that procedure should continue, it would effectively bankrupt our farmers. Therefore, we will have to change to the much looser continental system, which is not in the interests of veterinary medicine. To be honest, it is not in the interest of our vets and I doubt they will be pleased with it. The problem will then arise that if the vet gives a prescription and medicines are only available on prescription, does the vet have the monopoly on the supply of the drugs. The view of the pharmacists and the co-operatives, which are now involved in this area, will be that in practice, if not in theory, we are handing over a monopoly on the supply of veterinary medicines to the veterinary practitioners, all of whom have shops. In Denmark, a veterinary practitioner who gives a veterinary prescription is now allowed to have a retail outlet as part of his practice. We are opening up a whole new, difficult cultural area, therefore, and that is not in the best interests of our excellent veterinary practices.The permanent representative and the Department of Agriculture and Food officials laboured for a year and a half to get the Irish-British position accepted, even by way of derogation. I had long chats with the permanent representative, going back and forth, until very late last night and I regret to say that only yesterday, we lost the battle at COREPER and in the EPP group, which is my group. Mr. Philip Whitehead, who was battling to preserve the Irish-British argument, lost the battle in the Socialist Group. There is a compromise amendment which we reckon will have the numbers to get through plenary next week.Even though my amendment of two weeks ago on the environment committee was supported by 41 votes for, one against and only six abstentions – that was all of the 60 who were present on that occasion – there was an overwhelming majority to preserve the Irish-British position on prescription only medicines. That issue will go to a vote next week but if the two biggest groups are whipped into voting for this compromise, which does not accept it, and that compromise is accepted, everything below it will fall. It appears that my amendment, which was overwhelmingly supported in the environment, public health and consumer affairs committee, will fall next week.One might ask why veterinary medicines are dealt with in the environment committee. It is considered a public health-consumer affairs matter, a food chain issue. All the animal disease issues – foot and mouth disease, BSE, veterinary medicines, hormones – are dealt with by the environment committee, not by the committee on agriculture in Europe, which is strange. That is why the agricultural committee has diminished in power, so to speak. Some of the critical issues are decided by the environment committee and it is perhaps the reason, to end where I began, there are no longer any full members who are Irish on the committee on agriculture.Perhaps I have said enough and I should answer questions. I have been involved in a whole range of other issues. I will mention briefly the legislation, although I will not explain it. I mentioned the water framework directive, but there is also the waste electronic and electrical equipment directive, which is concerned with what happens to our televisions, refrigerators and toasters. The food supplements directive covers the health food area. There is a chemicals policy coming down the track. I have been very involved in the traditional herbal medicines directive. The emissions trading directive will have a major economic impact here and we have hardly woken up to what is going on in that area. I am involved also in the official feed and food controls directive, fisheries in the Irish Box, the Common Agricultural Policy and the consumer credit directive.On the packaging waste directive, I have been very involved in trying to get Ireland a derogation, along with Spain, Portugal and Greece, to 2010 if not 2011 before we have to comply with the directive. That will have a major impact because we do not have the network or the infrastructure to meet the waste recycling rates met by the rest of Europe. We have to be practical in what we sign up to but if we sign up under environmental and waste legislation, this country has to be fit to deliver. However, we should not sign up just for the sake of a quiet life in Europe. We should sign when we can commit and deliver rather than have 121 different items of European legislation that we have not transposed into Irish law and on which we will be hauled before the European courts. That is not the best way to behave.I am a member of the SME union, that is the small and medium enterprises union. In fact, I am one of the few women vice-presidents of it. That is the union or the discussion group which keeps an eye on small and medium size enterprises, the largest employers in all our countries, to ensure that the regulations we make do not do major damage when we roll them out. A number of problems have arisen in that particular area. I am the only Irish member of the SME union.We have no Irish member of EMAC, that is, the economic and monetary affairs committee which handles all the Single Market and competition legislation.

That is a critical committee which is not covered by an Irish MEP and it has caused problems because sometimes an issue has got as far as plenary before we twig that we should have been in there and not let it go as far as it did. With co-decision, if the committee has already signed up, it can be very hard to change it in plenary. Co-decision is critical to understand and it is the one area to which perhaps our permanent representative does not give enough credence. When we send our best officials to Brussels to brief the Ministers in all the different Councils of Ministers, they give a wonderful service. They even sit in on meetings if the Minister cannot attend. Now that 80% of the legislation in the European Parliament is co-decided by the Parliament and the Council of Ministers—
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Is it 80%?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Some 80% of legislation is now subject to co-decision. The permanent representative should be geared towards briefing the Irish MEPs to get the Irish position across and table the amendments before the committee concerned nails down the specifics. It goes to Council after committee and if the permanent representative was in the habit of advising the Council or the Minister, situations could be avoided where positions are taken at the committee stage that are very difficult to unravel. Ministers have been told, "Your MEPs never said that at committee, in fact, they voted unanimously for X and you now want Y", but that was because under the current co-decision ethos, we are not geared towards briefing the MEPs in the same way as other member states. We are more geared towards serving our Ministers. Successive Governments have done it that way but we need to keep our MEPs up to speed on the Irish position so that we are aware of a problem coming down the track or an issue that is of vital national interest to us.

#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Thank you, Acting Chairman. As my colleagues will tell me, and as Senator Walsh is very much aware, it was always a formidable task to follow the then Senator, and prior to that Minister, Doyle in this House. One had to be on one's toes and nothing has changed in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I thank the Senator.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I thank the Senator.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The last time Ms Doyle and myself passed each other at Dublin Airport, she had broken her leg and some wit said that Ms Doyle, in common with all her colleagues in the European Parliament, had broken her leg for Ireland. I am not sure if it is true but it was a good story and, in a sense, it conveys the immense amount of work MEPs get through, which she conveyed also in her contribution.It is timely that Ms Doyle is here. I know I am breaking procedures in referring to those who are in the Visitors Gallery but those young people who are here today are our future. I am sure part of the reason they are here is because they are doing what is called the civil, social and political project. If they nod in agreement I am right and if they do not, I am not right.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	229	They look rather stunned.

They are our future and in the context of what Ms Doyle said, I hope those young people, some of whom, statistically, will sit as Members in this House or the other House at some time in the future, will address the issues she has brought up about old attitudes. She talked about the permanent representatives and the way they brief Ministers. That appears to be part of our political culture, that the Executive rules and the Dáil and Seanad disposes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The permanent Government.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	232	The late John Healy, a good Mayo man, referred to it at one time as the permanent Government. Perhaps Ms Doyle might have a view on whether the current talk of reform in both Houses might somehow be relevant to what she is doing in Europe. She might have a view to express on the way the European experience can be brought more into the mainstream here.Without blowing my own trumpet, as our distinguished Leader, Senator O'Rourke, will be aware, I and others made a submission on this issue. In the context of the initiatives on accountability, it recommended that the relevant Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs should come to the House under a Second Stage procedure to allow the House to debate directives before they go to committee. Once Committee Stage has been completed, they should come before the House again before being returned to the European Parliament. I raise this matter because Ms Doyle referred to the vital area of co-decision. Senator O'Rourke, who has immense experience in Europe on this issue, acknowledges that matters are changing and have moved on to the extent that 80% of legislation is now subject to the co-decision procedure.Ms Doyle pointed out that we would have a new legal regime in the area of veterinary medicines.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	233	We will have to introduce a new domestic regime.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	234	She stated unequivocally that this would happen. Wherefore is this House and the other House, given that this deal has been done and dusted in Europe with the decision taken by a committee followed by the co-decision procedure? Our Ministers are aware of this initiative which I presume will now take the form of a directive to be implemented in our law. Ms Doyle does not have to address the issue now.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I will return to it later.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Perhaps she will take us through the co-decision procedure, its legislative impact and its relationship to the so-called powers of the Houses because it raises a fundamental issue about the future political direction of the European Union. In terms of the legislative process, the European Parliament is obviously far ahead of the Oireachtas, which appears to be stuck in a time warp. Does Ms Doyle have a view on this?Our young friends have now left the Chamber. Irrespective of the perception of the lifestyle of MEPs the media tend to convey to the general public, it appears to be a difficult one. MEPs are portrayed as constantly on junkets, spending most of their time banging the bells – incidentally, the name of the favourite pub of the former Deputy, John Healy, which is now gone – in Strasbourg and Brussels and sitting around in little more than a talking shop, namely, the European Parliament, the rest of the time. Ms Doyle will agree that this is a perception and, moreover, that it is more difficult for her, her colleagues and Members from all sides of this House involved in the political process to motivate the general public to go out and vote for MEPs in a European election when one is met with the general response that the European Parliament is not important and the real action takes place in the Dáil. Does she agree that the real legislative action is now in Strasbourg and Brussels and that it is of vital national importance that the electorate should be aware of this and vote accordingly?As I stated with regard to Mr. Ó Neachtáin earlier – I am making a political point – I have no doubt Ms Doyle will be successful in the next elections due to the immense work she is doing on behalf of her constituents and the country and I wish her well. All our MEPs seeking re-election deserve a vote of confidence from the electorate to continue the work they are doing. With so many of them retiring, there will be many new faces in the next Parliament.Will Ms Doyle explain the relationship between the European Parliament and its committees? For example, how was the veterinary directive she mentioned initiated? I presume directives are proposed by the Commission and then go before the committees. Given the increasing power of the committees, is legislation a done deal by the time it goes before a plenary session of the Parliament? Has the work already been done on the margins and the alliances formed?Does Ms Doyle agree with my view, based on limited experience, that food standards in other parts of Europe fall far short of what one has come to demand and expect here? I am referring to the public manifestation of food standards, for example, in restaurants and bars. We appear to have a strict regime in place and we constantly hear of small, family run food processors attracting the ire of the Commission for not adhering to particular food standards. Is this an unfair stereotype? I have in mind France as opposed to Germany or elsewhere. Pubs and restaurants in France seem to have a lower standard of hygiene and food than here. Is this because we are such good Europeans or am I being unfair to the French?In general, are we better Europeans than other countries? Has our size meant that we have not been able to rise up when directives are issued by the Commission and fling it back in its face, so to speak, in the same way the French and the Germans did with the Stability and Growth Pact?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Is the Senator asking if we are not as good at breaking the law?
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Yes, that is the drift of my question but I am being diplomatic. Is there a separate style of politics in Europe, a political way of doing things, which is somewhat foreign to us due to our peripheral nature and the culture we described earlier? Should we start adapting our political processes to be more specific?Groups operate in the European Parliament, across which alliances are constantly being formed. With the accession countries soon to come on board, is Ireland well positioned to develop alliances with what the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, referred to as like-minded countries? Although he used this term in the context of the constitutional treaty, will there be like-minded countries when representatives of the accession states enter the European Parliament or will they adopt a similar position to the Spaniards who, as Ms Doyle outlined, went local on one issue and separated from their groups to protect local interests? Does she envisage this process continuing? Does Tip O'Neill's point that all politics are local apply, even within the current alliances and despite the structures and architecture of the European Union?Moral issues tend to play a prominent role here. If we are not having a debate on abortion, we are debating divorce and having addressed that issue, we now have stem cell research. Do moral issues present a difficulty for our MEPs? Ms Doyle stated earlier that she wears the green jersey. Without singling out an individual, some of our MEPs perhaps wear a different jersey on occasions, which is the nature of politics and not unique to Ireland. Are we fighting a rearguard action on moral issues? Can Ms Doyle state with any degree of certainty that, notwithstanding the acknowledgement of Ireland's constitutional positions on these issues, circumstances could arise in which we will be seen to be out of kilter with the rest of Europe?The specific reason for raising this is that with no consensus on the vote on funding for human stem cell research, we found ourselves in one group of countries, while another group which did not share our position won the day. Does this or moral issues in general have any implications for us? I accept this is a complex issue and do not expect Ms Doyle to—

Ms Doyle pointed out that some of the best people are drawn back to their home countries. Is it correct to assume this is a direct result of the list system and would not happen here because of the peculiarities of our system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The use of by-elections is one such peculiarity.

As she stated, these issues are so complex that we do not have sufficient time to address them all. I have raised only a few pointers.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	243	Other Members will also ask questions.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	245	As Senator Mooney is an acknowledged expert on Europe I did not wish to interrupt his flow. I was also aware of the empathy between him and Ms Doyle, so I did not interfere. However, I ask other Senators to be more concise in their questions so that we may fit in everybody.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I welcome Deputy Doyle to the House. It is helpful to have her title clarified. During Ms Doyle's speech she referred to togging out in the Irish jersey. This is an interesting question, but we do not have time to dwell fully on it. Some members who go to Brussels are accused of going native; others are accused of simply peddling an Irish line. What is the balance? Do we send people to represent our constituencies in Europe or to present the views of Europe to us? How does it work best? There is a fine line between the two. I will not mention names, but there have been one or two MEPs through the years who worked on the basis that what was good for Europe was good for Ireland, while others take the opposite view, always pushing the Irish argument. What are Ms Doyle's views on that point?Ms Doyle mentioned the veterinary directive, on which I will not dwell. On the broader issue of agriculture, a subject to which Ms Doyle is well attuned, I asked the Leader yesterday morning if the Seanad could engage in a broad series of debates on the future of agriculture and she responded favourably to my suggestion. At European level there are various talks, packages and plans, such as the Fischler proposals. What is the current state of European thinking on the future of Irish agriculture? Is it seen as a sector which will continue to employ fewer and fewer people? Is there a management issue? Is there an idea that European agriculture can continue to employ tens of thousands of people across the Continent? This is a particularly appropriate question in the context of the accession of the new member states, which have a strong agricultural base. Finally, what does Ms Doyle think of the EU constitution, the treaty and the current intervention by Mr. Prodi?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I thank Ms Doyle for attending. I have always admired her style, and I am not talking about clothes, although that is part of it, but her demeanour. I do not think any of our visitors have explained so vividly the background to the committee system. Through this series of discussions we have obtained a much better understanding of how the European Parliament works. I did not know the committee system was so vitally important. The 60 member environment and consumer affairs committee, of which Ms Doyle is the chairman – I congratulate her on her appointment – is of great importance. To take up Senator Mooney's point, if people take a position on an item and win the vote, the plenary session is only procedure. The vote is taken then.I love everything about the European project, but the thing that puts me off being a member is the lifestyle – gathering at airports at the crack of dawn, waking up in different hotel bedrooms and going to different meetings, all the while keeping up with one's constituents. Ms Doyle is part of our constituency; I found traces of her all over Kilbeggan. For some reason she is particularly strong there. Senator Moylan will have something else to say about his area. In the last election I spoke to a group with which Ms Doyle was in touch and it praised her highly.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The Leader might be on the ticket for the next election.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	249	No, I do not want to be. I have fought against that under several Taoisigh and I have no wish to do it.I thank Ms Doyle for the vividness of the knowledge she has given us about the committee system, although it was sketchy because of time restraints. I understand that because of COREPER, the officials, Members and Ministers must all work very hard. I have spoken about this in the House before. From my knowledge, COREPER means that one is handed one's brief on the aeroplane to Brussels and told this is the position to take. What if one does not want to take that position? I do not agree with it. I was regarded as a general nuisance because I mentioned opinions of my own rather than sticking to those in my brief. If I said I did not like something, I was told it was all agreed at COREPER. In my mind I built COREPER up as a mysterious, exotic group of people who met in a dark cave at night and came to conclusions, which they drummed into compliant Ministers and then those who were not so compliant – those who must be worked on, such as me and some others. However, those in Brussels do wonderful work. The permanent representatives are at endless meetings day and night. I thank Ms Doyle for her vividness and her willingness to come to the House, but also for her service to the country, which she has given in many guises.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Senator Mooney referred to the subject of one of my questions. As one who is in the restaurant business, we have higher standards here than exist in other countries, such as Spain. I am worried about what Ms Doyle said about the veterinary directive, which will have serious consequences for us. Those in the equestrian world have raised serious concerns about it. In remote parts of the country, if a prescription is required, the vet might be 30 or 40 miles away. What will happen then? Could we end up with more than one standard, as happens in the area of food hygiene, with a higher standard in this country than in other European countries for veterinary matters? I am worried about having two standards as a result of the veterinary directive.The Minister for Finance announced some tax breaks in the budget subject to EU regulations. What is the thinking on tax breaks at EU level? Are people for them or against them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	251	They are against them.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I apologise for missing Ms Doyle's speech; I was about her father's business at the Forum on Europe. I welcome Ms Doyle to the Seanad. It is invaluable that she and her colleagues come to the Seanad to share their experiences. We all find it very helpful. I congratulate her on the way she represents her constituents and Ireland in Europe. As chairman of the Forum on Europe, I find it fascinating how people manage with a one-minute speaking slot in the European Parliament. It does not seem to have rubbed off on some of Ms Doyle's colleagues who came here.How can we engage young people with the idea and workings of Europe? How do the MEPs manage it? Do they crank up the machine at every election or is it a continuing process? Can they share with constituency or party colleagues in clinics and so on?
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I welcome Ms Doyle to the House. She raised some important points, including the matter of the veterinary medicines directive. In the past we had major problems with the wildlife directive, which came through in a similar fashion, unannounced until it was already the law. I am aware this directive is in the pipeline. Ms Doyle briefly mentioned the possibility of an annual veterinary certificate for farmers. Can this be done? If so, it is the only way to go. Farmers who have always used certain products to treat maladies, such as blackleg, will no longer be able to use them. That has major implications for our farmers.The other point she mentioned was a closed shop from the veterinary side. Many of those employed in veterinary medicine, who sell what they are entitled to sell, are now in trouble. The co-operatives are in trouble as they will be unable to sell those medicines. As legislators we must do something about this. Ms Doyle is MEP for my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, part of which is not classified as severely handicapped. Part of the constituency qualified for inclusion in the BMW region as it is classified disadvantaged. I urge Ms Doyle to do whatever she can to ensure that the rest of Laoighis-Offaly is included in the BMW region.Having listened to MEPs speak about the raft of legislation with which they have to deal, I suggest more use be made of the Committee of the Regions. Many of those directives could be promoted by the committee because its members are also members of local authorities who have interaction with regional authorities and county councils. In that way, we would be more up to speed on what is happening. The veterinary medicines directive has been foisted on us and will cause serious problems. I thanks Ms Doyle for an outstanding presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I will do my best to reply but I will not be able to deal with all the issues raised. Issues concerning the annual veterinary certificate and co-operatives were raised. What was decided at COREPER yesterday – it has another meeting today – will be voted on next week in the plenary session in Strasbourg. Effectively, this means British and Irish domestic law in this area will be changed. The best guess as to what we will do will be something similar to what is done in France, where an annual script or a six-months script for veterinary medicines is given to farmers for a range of medicines that are now non-prescription, such as teat dips, iodine, parasiticides, anthelmintics and so on. Antibiotics and steroids will continue to be issued on the basis of clinical diagnosis per prescription because of the risk to the food chain. General animal husbandry farm medicines would have to be issued on an annual or six month script. Members need to speak with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, about this to ascertain how he will accommodate Ireland to stay within the terms of this veterinary medicines directive. We have a few years to sort ourselves out. There is a gap between the time a directive is passed in Europe and transposed into Irish law. It is only today that the Department of Agriculture and Food is wondering how it will accommodate the Irish farmer, the co-operative, the pharmacist, the veterinary practitioner and, above all, protect the food chain in what is being demanded to square that circle.What we sought posed no risk to the food chain. Residue tests, while they do not reveal high levels of residue, show that the highest level of residue comes from antibiotics which are already on prescription. To put everything on prescription will not guarantee any greater safety to the food chain. The period between administering the drug and slaughter and observing the correct withdrawal period, or MRL, is what safeguards the food. Whether one has a prescription will not guarantee that the farmer will be any better in obeying the withdrawal period. Generally farmers are excellent in this area and most drugs are out of the blood stream in three to four weeks so it is not an issue. The argument will be made that this is a food chain issue and that we had to do this. It has nothing to do with the food chain. It is not a harmonisation or a Single Market issue, which is the other argument that will be made, because there is no definition of a "veterinary medicine" or a "veterinary prescription" in the directive. A veterinary prescription is treated differently in every country in Europe as is veterinary medicine.Some countries have farm medicines which will escape this directive but we do not divide our medicines between farm medicines and veterinary medicines. A package of choices will have to be made and domestic legislation will have to be changed. Perhaps in a few months time when this issue settles down and the Department officials have had to time to think it out, there could be an interesting debate with the Minister to tease out the implications. The co-operatives will let Members know all about it. There has been a public debate – it is one issue on which I would gently chide Members – in the Irish Farmers Journal, the farming supplement of the Irish Independent, The Examiner and other newspapers, on the comings and goings of the veterinary medicines directive for well over a year. No later than last week I read about this in the Irish Farmers Journal. Until it hits the ground, it does not become a politically sexy issue. People do not wake up and see the implications in this case. Some of us have been battling very hard, regrettably in vain. We did not have the support around the Council table as reflected by the COREPER people, who reflect how their Ministers will vote. Sweden, Portugal, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland supported it but the other countries did not. The Italians did not support it because it was their Presidency and it is a huge coup for the pharmaceutical package, two directives and a regulation, to go through under the Italian Presidency.Before lunch I spoke with a Senator about the list system. I do not agree with list systems for the Irish situation as a general statement. We have an intimacy with our electorate and we have small geographic constituencies in which we give a personal coalface service. If there were ever to be a list system in Ireland – Ireland is the only country in Europe that does not have a list system for the European elections – even with an extended Europe of 25 members, my view would stand up. There are different list systems but I do not have time to explain them.If I am elected to go to Europe to represent my constituents in Leinster or Leinster East – I call it Ireland East – I should be in Brussels from Monday to Thursday. I am elected to be there and to work on my legislation, and to watch for what is in the best interests of the Single Market and the common European project. I must also recognise where there is a vital national interest requiring Ireland's case to be protected in a certain amendment or under a certain piece of legislation. In 95% of the legislation we go with Europe or with our political group but, on occasion, there are issues that are of such interest to Ireland that we have to stand against our political group and take a different stance. There is the freedom to do that. There is a balance between going native and togging out for Ireland. It is a judgment call that one trusts one's MEPs to make at the time, a balance between what one's political group wants, what the Department wants at home or what a lobby group in one's constituency is calling for. One has to get the core right.On the issue of food standards and the law, there is a new European food safety authority. A significant amount of legislation is being spawned by that authority. I cannot agree that the standards in France and Spain are better or worse than in Ireland. Some of the best food in the world is in Brussels and on the European continent. One can go into any restaurant in any country occasionally and the hygiene standards will be well below par. A new food and feed control directive is coming down the track – I was the rapporteur for the agricultural committee – which will make common legal standards of inspection on food and feed control, literally from the farmer to the plate in the restaurant. At present there are different levels of enforcement. The law is the same but some countries are more rigorous in enforcing it in particular areas. That is the reason it may appear there are different standards.The issue of reform was raised. It would be very interesting to invite Commissioner Fischler to address the House. Many questions were asked on the status of the mid-term review and the thinking on agriculture. The thinking on agriculture is that it is driven by the consumer and food production and no longer driven by the farmer and agricultural production. In Ireland we still look a little more at the farmer's perspective and gear towards the farmer rather than the consumer. Certainly, in Italy, Spain and the UK, this is driven entirely by consumer demand. In France, they are more like us, and it is driven by the farmer. There is a change in emphasis in all countries towards consumer demand. That is why we look at the issue from a food safety point of view and work from the plate back to the plough. The perspective has changed.Senator Maurice Hayes asked how to get more young people involved. I regularly speak to school students, a rewarding endeavour, and let them question me. One wag asked me in a school recently to tell him what I earned. I asked if he was computer literate and he said he was. I gave him the address of my website and told him that he would find exactly what I earn – it is a matter of public record – rather than get into a debate with him.On Monday 24 November, I started my day at 11 a.m. in Dunlavin school in County Wicklow, addressing the youngsters for an hour and a half. I then went to get the afternoon flight to Brussels and worked in my office until 9.30 p.m., with one short meeting at 7 p.m. The next morning I flew back to Dublin with the European Monetary Affairs Committee – there is no Irish representative on the committee and I was asked to accompany its members. We had meetings with Mr. John Hurley, the governor of the Central Bank, the Stock Exchange, the Minister for Finance, IBEC and others. It was a very interesting day. We finished in IBEC at 9 p.m. after supper and I was asked if would I take the committee to a famous Irish pub for a pint. I do not know when I was last in a pub in Dublin but I delivered and found a well known watering hole on Baggot Street. The next morning I tried to fly back to attend an environment committee because the issue of veterinary medicines was being debated, including my amendment. I missed my flight at Dublin Airport and got re-routed through Amsterdam. The Amsterdam connection was cancelled because of fog and I ended up taking a bus from Amsterdam to Brussels so I will not describe the humour I was in when I arrived on Wednesday night.On Thursday morning I appeared at the environment committee to table my amendment. I then flew back that afternoon for Pat Cox's State visit as President of the European Parliament and we had to attend a dinner. On Friday I was in Belfast until 8 p.m., then I drove to Galway to chair a session of our party conference on Saturday, 29 November. At 4 p.m. on Saturday I drove home and watched Deputy Enda Kenny on the television and was duly impressed. That is all in one week. I left home on Monday and got back at 7 p.m. on the Saturday having flown back and forth from Brussels twice to do what I thought needed to be done.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I thank Ms Doyle for coming to address the Seanad. It was a most informative presentation. I served with her on Wexford County Council for some years and she was a valued member of the council. It is fair to say that Fine Gael has failed to fill the void she left. She is an articulate and positive voice for Ireland in the European Parliament and I wish her well whether she chooses to continue her political career or decides to retire in June 2004 after 30 years of service.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I thank the Acting Chairman, the Leader of the House, Members on all sides and the staff for their courtesy this afternoon and wish everyone a happy Christmas and a prosperous new year. I assure Senator Jim Walsh that my name is on the ticket for the selection convention in February.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	257	On behalf of Seanad Éireann, I welcome back to the House Mr. Brian Crowley, MEP. He has represented the constituency of Munster in the European Parliament since 1994. He comes from a very distinguished political family and I was a colleague of his father, Mr. Flor Crowley, in the Oireachtas. Mr. Brian Crowley was appointed to the Seanad by the Taoiseach in February 1993 and resigned from it when he became an MEP. Despite his short term as a Senator, he made an impact as an effective and well briefed contributor, particularly in the justice and equality areas. He continues to be active in those areas in the European Parliament and I wish him every success in the forthcoming elections in 2004. He is also a distinguished member of the Council of State appointed by President McAleese. I am delighted he is with us today and we look forward to his address.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	258	It is a privilege to be back in this august House once more. Many people say they got their grounding in political life in local organisations or in local government but I had the great honour to experience public life for the first time in this Chamber, in the very seat where Senator Mary White is sitting. I occasionally threw barbs not only across the floor but at my own side.It would be remiss of me not to mention two former Cathaoirligh of the Seanad with whom I served and who, unfortunately, are no longer with us – Mr. Seán Fallon and Mr. Liam Naughten. They gave great public service not only to this House but to their country and gave me great advice as a young politician beginning my career. I got a grounding here that has helped me to deal with many complex issues in the European sphere on both a political and personal level. In many ways the European Parliament is like the Seanad because it is a policy and issue-driven body, more so than the lower chambers in national parliaments. While people may find it hard to understand where decisions are made, the best decisions and results are formed through consensus and compromise rather than through antagonism or conflict between different ideologies. One of the great benefits of being in the Parliament is that without a formal opposition, such as exists in most national parliaments, it is necessary for all sides, from the far right to the far left, to find common ground to ensure that the Parliament's voice is heard within the co-decision procedure.Today I will discuss some of the work I do on committees and some aspects of that work with which the Seanad will deal as legislation arises, and with important current issues such as those within the proposed constitution for the European Union. I serve on the legal affairs and internal market committee of the Parliament and on the employment and social affairs committee, and I am a substitute on the fisheries committee. The work of these committees is more proactive and involving than the media portrays. Mr. Ó Neachtáin has already spoken about issues with which the fisheries committee is dealing so I will not repeat that.One of the two big issues under discussion at the legal affairs and internal market committee is the recognition of professional qualifications, to create a single European directive to allow for the recognition of qualifications across a wide range of professions and sectors. Hitherto, individual directives have covered doctors, nurses, teachers, physiotherapists, lawyers and so on but we are now bringing in one single directive which will include all professions and all sectors. From the outside this might appear to be a good way of streamlining legislation to avoid the overlay of bureaucracy which can occur with some European legislation but in reality it fails to distinguish between the inherent differences in professions. For example, there is a difference between medical professionals and librarians, which is not intended in any way to demean or diminish the role of librarians. Doctors and nurses have duties and obligations with regard to the treatment of patients who need certainty about the quality and standard of those people.This directive proposes forming a single committee at European level, not necessarily drawn from the medical profession but which could determine the minimal standards for recognition of qualifications. This does not appear to present a problem until one looks at the different branches of medicine, for example, in Ireland there are cardiologists but this specialisation is not recognised in Germany. A doctor who had completed the necessary training for recognition as a specialist surgeon in any field could then be registered as a cardiologist in Ireland even though he or she may have no specific training in cardiology. Likewise, nurses and people who are delivering services daily on a more interactive level with patients do not have to be registered with the local registration or licensing body for a period of 16 weeks under this proposal.Some Senators may recall that recently a group from England came to Ireland offering a single vaccine instead of the three-in-one MMR vaccine. There was some concern about the effects of the three-in-one jab. Without any determination of their qualifications or professionalism to deliver those jabs or any recognition of the type of vaccine they were creating they would, under this directive, be entitled to operate in Ireland for 16 weeks without ever having to register with An Bord Altranais, the Irish Medical Council or any other organisation. This is a retrograde step because it does not give certainty or guarantee to the patient on the quality of care or training that professional has undergone. In Ireland we have been successful in establishing through our regulatory authorities, be it the Law Society, the Medical Council or An Bord Altranais that a standard of care and professional training was available that gave some certainty and guarantees to patients and clients.In addition, there is the issue of where the power of the member state lies to protect individuals because if something goes wrong with someone who has come in under one of these recognised qualifications and there is a mishap, against whom does one take action? These people are not necessarily registered with the local authorities and there is no European authority to which one has recourse. Under the civil law they can be caught as individuals but the professional and criminal law may not be able to deal with them. One of my Italian colleagues, Mr. Zappala, is bringing a report to the Parliament with 452 amendments on which we will have to vote in the plenary session next week. The Oireachtas will have to deal with the transposition of that law into the national law.The second important area is employment and social affairs. In recent years we have seen an explosion in the regulations and directives controlling the rights of workers particularly with regard to health and safety concerning maternity or adoptive leave or individual worker's rights vis-à-vis the employer. That has been to the good, not only for the individual worker but also for industrial relations and the development of social partnership at national and European levels. Without wishing to be parochial, Ireland is a very good role model for social partnership because it gives the individual representatives of employers, trade unions and other social partners the opportunity to sit down and chart a course for future national development. The partners do not take account merely of the self interest of the sector or group but look at the wider national interest and ensure that people's opportunities and rights are protected. At times, however, we become too technical and detailed in the areas of legislation in which we are involved. While I do not want to minimise risk or danger and believe that people should be protected, we are dealing with a report on the carcinogenic properties of wood dust. Senators may be interested to know given the nature of the room in which we are sitting, that mahogany has the highest density of carcinogens in its dust than any other type of wood available. Certain protections must be put in place for workers dealing with this kind of dust.I am not a scientist but I know there are people in this House who are and who have strong scientific backgrounds. How do I know to what saturation level of air by wood dust it is safe to expose a worker? These areas of legislation are best dealt with by and left to experts. Our role should be to lay down the guiding principles and general law not the specifics of what that law should be. In one sense we in the European Parliament tend to shoot ourselves in the foot by the types of laws and proposals we bring forward. This relates to the interaction of the balance between the various institutions. We do not propose law, we merely respond and react to the proposals brought to us from the Commission. The European Commission is the only body of the European institutions entitled to propose legislation. Since the passing of the Amsterdam treaty in particular, the Parliament has been a co-decision maker in 70% of the areas of law coming forward. We have a significant and strong role in bringing forward amendments to those proposals.I wish to deal with a matter related to legal affairs. I do not wish to be too controversial or dogmatic on some of the areas about which I am speaking. One of the proposals in the new constitution for Europe relates to the harmonisation of criminal codes in respect of criminal laws and that there be a single criminal procedure across the European Union. Coming from a common law background and as one who has some small understanding of the common law procedures, I am firmly of the opinion that we cannot and should not harmonise criminal law or criminal prosecutions across the European Union.I hold that view for a number of reasons, although primarily for two main reasons. Within the Irish judicial system we have established rights, through judge-made law as well as through constitutional rights, on the protection of individuals, protection from harassment, false imprisonment and wrongful arrest and on other such areas. We also have a clear prosecutorial system whereby the prosecution service is independent of the State and even independent of the arresting authority or the determining authority, the Judiciary. If there was a single harmonised system across the European Union, it would undermine the rights which exist here for individuals who are arrested or brought before the courts. It would also undermine the independence of the prosecution service because it may be forced to take a prosecution on foot of a request from another member state or another institution. It would also undermine the independence of the Judiciary not only to take account of the facts in the case, but also to mitigate the sentence imposed.We give a good deal of leeway to our judges to take into account circumstances related to the individual as well as to the crime. While that may be difficult for people at times because of so-called lenient sentences being handed down, on the whole it has been to the good not only of the individual and the victim of the crime, but also to our society because it shows mercy and clemency. Our criminal system is not simply about retribution or revenge; it is also about rehabilitation and giving people a second chance. We are best able to deal with those issues ourselves and we should not hand over responsibility for them and be bound by a strict and rigid civil code, as is in place in Germany, France and Italy.A second point regarding that area of the new constitution is that a constant battle has been taking place at European level concerning the creation of a new post of European public prosecutor. The public prosecutor would undertake the same work as the Director of Public Prosecutions, but the language in which the creation of that post is buried or cushioned is to the effect that it would only be in place to protect the financial interests of the European Union. If one notes the development of any institution or new body within the European Union, irrespective of its original intention, it has always expanded and broadened.Many people want to see the creation of a federal Europe, whereby there would be a single police force, prosecution service, judiciary and investigation service. Due to the differences not only between the common and civil law as regards Ireland and Britain as against the rest of the Europe, but also the differences in the certainty with regard to the independence of the prosecution and judicial services in other countries, it is best that such services are dealt with at a national level. There are already ample laws in place to protect the financial interests of members states and the European institutions without creating another body to do so.Another aspect concerning the proposed constitution relates to the difficult area of defence. Some Members may have seen recent media coverage on negotiations whereby there is a move to create a defence structure within the European Union. I am opposed to this move. Ireland has shown through its involvement with the United Nations and other organisations that by being neutral and non-aligned it can act as a bridge maker or peacekeeper between different countries without putting this country into the eye of the conflict and putting its people at risk. With a new contingent of our troops having gone to Liberia on a peacekeeping mission, it is even more important that in terms of our actions we are seen as an independent, honest broker. I am heartened that the other neutral states in the European Union have already come together.As Members may be aware, last Friday representatives of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria came together and signed a joint letter to the Italian Presidency of the European Union concerning negotiations that will take place this weekend on the proposed constitution. In that letter they emphasised the constitutional obligations not only on the Irish Government and its people with regard to their non-aligned and neutral status, but that the role of those other three countries is still seen as independent, neutral and non-aligned and they will not support a mutual assistance or mutual defence clause as exists in the charter for NATO or for other organisations around the world.I wish to deal with another aspect of the proposed constitution. I do not wish to insult anybody by what I say but it is important to point out that in the previous referenda held here, much discourse and debate took place on the basis of fear – fear of losing our independence, of losing our sovereignty, of being a party to a mutual defence clause and of immigration. Surely, as a country we have developed so much, particularly during the past 20 years, not to mind since our independence in the 1920s, that we can stand up and be proud of what we have achieved and be confident within our wit, intelligence and skills to be able to face any challenge put before us. Why should fear be used as an argument not to do something? I am reminded of the words of Edward Kennedy at his brother's grave. I think he was quoting George Bernard Shaw when he said: "Some men see things as they are and wonder why. I see things as they should be and say why not?" Why should we be fearful of any change even in industrial development terms?I must be careful in my expression, but when this country was on its knees economically, we could attract industry and investment to Ireland. We are now fearful that with the enlargement of the European Union we may lose out in the future to so-called lower cost economies in eastern Europe when the reality is that the accession countries not only represent what is the true idealism of the European Union – creating an area and zone of peace, prosperity and harmony across the Continent of Europe which has so often been divided and in conflict over the past 100 years. Such countries will be future allies, the people in those countries think in a similar way to us and they look to Ireland as a model and example of how a small country on the periphery of Europe can still be such an influential character and actor within the architecture of this new Europe. If anything, we are at fault as elected representatives in not communicating that message strongly enough to people and not involving them more in the day to day detail of what takes place at European Union level, but as Members are aware it is even difficult to get people to hear what they say in this Chamber. I remember sitting in this House in 1993 listening to Gordon Wilson, one of the foremost Senators of our time and the truest example of what human forgiveness can be, speaking of his loss and hurt while reaching out the hand of friendship and forgiveness and attempting to see another way forward. I remember him one day quoting St. Francis of Assisi who said "Where there is war, let me sow peace". If anything, Europe has achieved that goal of the founding fathers, of sowing peace where previously there was conflict, mayhem, division and war.In many ways we have become complacent because peace has existed for so long. Nevertheless, the risks of fraction, war and conflict are as great, if not greater, today than they were 50 years ago. The more we can co-operate and co-ordinate, the better it is not only for us in Ireland but for all of Europe. Let us not be afraid to say what we believe in, but let us not fear to take on new ideas and proposals for the future. We cannot have stagnancy. We either move forward or die. If we do not move forward, holding on to what makes us uniquely different as Irish people, we will be left to squander the success of the past.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I am delighted to be here today to welcome our MEP, Brian Crowley, to this Chamber. As he said, he began his political career in this House in 1993, I believe, when I started myself. It was here he cut his teeth although, knowing him, he probably cut his teeth in politics the day he was born. He did not pick it off the ground. He tidied up the loose ends of his thinking in this House and moved on to greater things. It was a pleasure to listen to his speech today and to hear his insights into his briefs in legal and social affairs during his term as an MEP.I could speak on many of the subjects on which Mr. Crowley touched this afternoon, and ask many questions. I will focus on the area of harmonisation of professional qualifications and the directive about which Mr. Crowley rightly expressed apprehension, asking how it will work in the member states. I too am apprehensive when considering the example of a doctor with a primary degree perhaps practising as a cardiologist in some member states. In Ireland, we are not yet generally aware that such situations exist. We know nothing about them. Mr. Crowley said the matter will eventually be discussed in Ireland, but that might be too late. Have representatives of An Bord Altranais and Comhairle na nOspidéal been invited to a discussion on the matter? I welcome the harmonisation of primary degrees as that is overdue. In postgraduate courses, however, member states should lay down their own ground rules regarding requirements and quality of care. There might be an overview of the quality of care in the medical and science area, but the role of individual member states should be taken into account. Mr. Crowley spoke of the fear that postgraduate courses could be harmonised and that we could see a doctor with only a primary degree practising as a cardiologist if this legislation is fully implemented. One can understand there would be fears in this area.I cite this merely as one example of the issues touched on by Mr. Crowley. I agree with most of the sentiments he expressed about opening up, not being afraid and moving forward. We have come a long way over the past few decades. It would worry me, however, that as a member state we would not maintain controls where necessary. I look forward to hearing Mr. Crowley's comments.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I welcome Deputy Crowley to the House. We were advised earlier that the proper term was "Deputy". He is very welcome back to the House in which he served with distinction some years ago.Many of my colleagues have questions so I will keep to one or two areas. One of those is defence, the matter with which Mr. Crowley concluded his speech. He gave us his personal view and made the point that in broader terms, the more we co-operate and co-ordinate, the better. I agree, but where does that leave us in the broader defence and security context? It is doubly difficult now in the post-Iraq war situation, with Europe sidelined as a political grouping or body. Europe was to some degree divided during that war. It then became politically divided and did not have a common voice. Currently, some countries within the EU, led by France and Germany, are talking of the need for some sort of central defence and military planning. That concept is being very strongly opposed by the United States which wants to ensure that NATO is at the core of such defence and planning. What is the thinking of Mr. Crowley on that matter? If we want a strong, cohesive Europe, and some European countries want to look after their own defence and security planning, do we distance ourselves from that argument, and by doing so allow an external body, the United States, to be at the core of that development and planning? Do we want Europe to plan its own future in defence and security? Should we play a part in that or stand aside? We must ask ourselves these basic questions.A more political issue relates to engaging the Irish public in European politics. The European elections will take place next June, and going by recent voting trends, notwithstanding the local elections taking place on the same day, at best some 51% or 52% of Irish people will vote. Although Mr. Crowley may well be unwilling to advise us on how he gets so many votes for himself, could he advise us on how we might engage the public to a greater degree so that they would see the European elections as relevant? Regrettably, the majority of people who will vote next June will have the European elections in the backs of their minds. The big issue for them on the day will be either the local town council election or the county council election. These bodies are important politically, but we must focus the attention of the Irish public as best we can on the politics of Europe, the political choices facing Europe and the European elections.We have considered this issue in this Chamber without getting any answers. Mr. Crowley might suggest how we might engage the people so that they will at least discuss the political choices, options and groupings, and when they vote will then have as much interest in the European elections as they may have in the more local elections.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I welcome Mr. Crowley and thank him for his speech. I was introduced to him just a couple of weeks ago but met him a few years ago during one of the Cork by-elections either in Cork North-Central or South-Central. I knew from the reaction of people meeting him that day that he was well thought of and well liked in his constituency and nationally.I found Mr. Crowley's contribution very interesting. His perspective is particularly interesting because he has also been a Senator. He raised the issue of the criminal code, which is an issue the Oireachtas is examining in the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, of which I am a member. We are asking if we should reform the criminal code and also consider the civil code. For me, the jury is out on that issue, if the pun may be excused. I fully agree that the criminal code is something that Irish parliamentarians must decide. We must look at the issues closely and consult the public before making any decision. It should not be imposed from Europe. I agree with Mr. Crowley on that point.Many of the issues raised by Mr. Crowley are being examined in the Oireachtas. How can we do more to create structured relationships between the European Parliament and our national Parliament? Visits from MEPs are useful but we must develop this with a more structured approach. Could the European Parliament not sit in different member states? There was considerable involvement in European matters during the debate on the second Nice treaty referendum. This was largely due to the fact that the Houses of the Oireachtas were engaged in discussion of the topic and to the meetings of the National Forum on Europe. This debate brought a media focus onto Europe and encouraged national discussion of European matters. We must find ways of making the European Parliament more accessible to people in Ireland. We might do that by fostering an engagement between the two parliamentary levels.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank Senators for their questions. I share Senator Ormonde's concerns about the professional qualifications directive. One of the first votes taken in the legal affairs committee of the Parliament was an effort to separate the medical profession from other professions in the directive because medical professionals take life and death decisions. I have had several discussions with An Bord Altranais, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Irish Medical Council and the representative bodies of physiotherapists and pharmacists in an effort to arrive at a common platform on these issues. All the representative organisations of the medical professions have come together with a single voice and with amendments to the different areas of the directive. We have attempted to submit those proposals and to gain support for them. We have been successful in some but not in others.This will be coming back to the Oireachtas for discussion in both Houses. I do not know if that will be done by ministerial order or by new legislation, but I presume the directive will be discussed in these Houses. I remember that ministerial orders are laid before the House for a period of 21 days during which time they can be challenged or brought forward for debate. That could be the opportunity to debate the issue.One of the suggestions for the new constitution is that national parliaments would play a greater role in European legislation. They would have an opportunity to refer specific areas of law or proposed legislation back to the Commission if there was a difficulty or dispute. This would be an extra block. This touches on what Senator Tuffy said about closer involvement by the different institutions. The purpose of this directive is to facilitate the Internal Market and the free movement of people, goods and services. Many countries have placed restrictions on the recognition of qualifications and that is why there was a necessity for legislation to put in place common standards and rules across member states.Senator Bradford obviously is not thinking of standing for the European elections if he is asking me for advice on achieving voter turnout. I know there is a difference of opinion between political parties in the Oireachtas regarding Ireland's role in defence arrangements. The Constitution states that we cannot be part of a defence alliance to which a mutual defence or solidarity clause is attached. It would require a referendum to alter that position. I do not believe there is a public willingness or support for Ireland to be part of such an organisation. We already have involvement at European level in the co-ordination of security. Representatives of the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and Departments meet their colleagues from other countries on a regular basis to discuss issues of mutual concern, co-operation and co-ordination. We will see standardisation of weaponry among European armies to create a European arms resource. This is being pushed by a number of countries in Europe not so that more countries will be able to buy more arms, but so that there will be certainty of supply from European manufacturers of weaponry and arms.The current debate regarding a defence clause in the new constitution and the organisation of an independent defence planning organisation within the European Union is led by France and Germany. This debate has been going on in the European Union for 30 years, led by Germany and France. The financial investment required to bring up an organisation capable of taking over NATO's existing role would amount to 20% of EU GDP as well as 20% of the GDP of each member state. I do not believe there is the political or financial willingness to make that kind of investment. I also believe it would be wrong.One of the protections proposed in the letter written by the four neutral states and part of the proposals for the constitution being discussed this weekend would allow for co-operation or co-ordination to take place between individual countries, but for that to be referred back to the European Council as a whole if the parliament of any member state objected to it. The European Council would then be obliged to take a unanimous decision before it could go ahead. We will see small rather than large steps in those areas.We will see more European co-operation with regard to undertaking UN mandated missions. In a speech in New York last week, Kofi Annan said that the UN is looking more and more towards regional forces being available for deployment to regional areas rather than deploying multinational and multi-continental forces. When Irish troops were in the Lebanon there were, at one point, representatives from four continents and 52 countries in the UNIFIL group. Such a force is not easy to organise logistically or in terms of language or command and control structures.The question of voter turnout is an ongoing problem at European and national level. A graph of voter turnout from the 1920s to 2002 shows a continuing downward trend at European, national and local level. The continuation of this decline is one of my greatest fears. Democracy is a precious jewel and people must recognise that unless they take their responsibility to vote and to participate in the democratic process seriously, extreme viewpoints will succeed. I am a great believer in the intelligence of the electorate and in their willingness to understand what they are doing or not doing. By not participating they may be making an objection and expressing the view that they are not involved enough and do not have enough on-hand interaction with their representatives. One reason I regularly tour different parts of Munster is to maintain that local involvement. I do not see my role as an MEP as different from that of a Member of the Oireachtas or a member of a local authority. We are elected as public representatives to be the voice and the advocates of the people. If we are good advocates the people will support us and if we do not represent what they say, they will not.Senator Tuffy asked what is the best way to ensure people are involved. My answer is that I do not know. If this House can find an answer to that question I would be delighted to hear it. Voting is compulsory in countries such as Australia and Belgium and perhaps that could be the answer whereby people are forced to vote. However that then takes away the freedom of choice which should be enjoyed. If a system of compulsory voting were introduced, it might be necessary to allow for a situation whereby people could abstain from voting by indicating on the ballot paper that they did not wish to vote for any of the candidates. The introduction of electronic voting will mean that those who are dissatisfied will not be able to write the usual comments that are found on ballot papers. One may criticise those people for making those comments but at least they took the time to go out and vote.The most important vote that took place on the island of Ireland since 1923 was the vote on the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement yet nearly 30% of the electorate did not participate in the vote. It was one of the most important issues for the country, for the saving of human life and for the creation of new institutions, yet there is still a body of people who do not wish to be engaged. I do not think that problem can be overcome.Senator Tuffy asked about the questions raised on the issue of reform of the criminal code. The more involvement I have at a European level and the more I see some of the criminal and judicial practices in other member states, the more certain I am of how good the Irish model is and the less inclined I am to allow any changes. Our system has its faults and mistakes are made at times because, to be fair, we are dealing with human beings who are interpreting law and who are influenced by other issues so mistakes will be made. On the balance of probabilities, our system is the best system.Moving slightly off the point, our electoral system is the best electoral system in Europe. Ireland is the only country in the European Union where MEPs are individually elected. In every other country, a party list system or form thereof is in place. People vote for the party and not for the individual. There is no obligation on those individuals to report back to their constituents. These are two glaring examples of the way our system is better than the systems available at the level of individual countries or at a European level.I have been involved with cases of individuals who have been incarcerated in European countries for two years without being brought before a judge to see whether or not there was prima facie evidence for a case to be heard or for a prosecution to be taken. There may be difficulties in the Irish system but that would not happen. There was no legal mechanism whereby appeals could be made to a court to release those people. The protections that have built up, such as free criminal legal aid, which are judge-made creations in one sense, are good, positive measures that should be maintained in this country.I do not believe we should harmonise or reduce those protections for the individual or the independence of the Judiciary or of the prosecution system. I am aware of prosecutions being taken in member states against elected representatives purely on the basis of their political standing or position. Members of the European Parliament in this position must come before the legal affairs committee which also deals with the immunity from prosecution of members.It is acknowledged that when parties of the left are in government, the politicians of the right will be caught and the opposite also applies. It makes a joke of what prosecution should mean. I have serious doubts about it.

He was one of the first of our party members to reply to the invitation. The House has listened to his vivid description of his life and the committees of which he is a member. One of the benefits of this initiative was that the House was given an insight and learned more about the operations of the European Parliament.I wish to ask a simple question which follows from Mr. Crowley's answer to Senator Bradford's question. He said he was elected by the people and spoke about the fragile nature of democracy. Has the Deputy a system for keeping in touch with his constituents? Does he meet them on a representative basis, individually or in groups? Does he have a clinic and keep an office in County Cork? How does he marshall his potential votes, hold on to what he has and prepare for the forthcoming election?

I thank him for making himself available to public representatives, schools and colleges in the Munster region. I congratulate him on his fine address to the House which detailed the achievements of Ireland during its 30-year membership of the European Union.The issue of the open skies policy is regarded as very important in the Munster region. Will this be dealt with at EU level in order to safeguard Shannon Airport which is very important to the Munster region.

I have admired him for a long time and I congratulate him on his speech.The scrutiny of EU documents is carried out by the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I have noticed in my short time in the Oireachtas that much detail is lost in that scrutiny. Reams of paper with information about directives and proposed changes are produced. The recent debate about stem cell research was a recent example. Only 1% of the population realised that this topic had been discussed and passed three years ago. Has Mr. Crowley any thoughts on how the jargon can be simplified?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Senators for their kind comments. Senator Henry asked a very pertinent question. Fortunately, I had the wisdom to know that I was never going to be good enough to be in the next U2 or the next Beatles and other career opportunities would have to present themselves. I do not think I have the skin type necessary to survive in the Law Library for too long.I have been given opportunities in my life and I have grown and developed as a result. Each has played a part in making me what I am today and I am quite happy with that. Hopefully people will continue to allow me to do what I am doing.The Leader, Senator O'Rourke, asked about my system. I must be very careful and cautious about telling the House everything I do. This is a public hearing and I do not wish to give out all the information. From day one, it has been my duty to report back to the people and I do so every weekend in different parts of Munster. I do it at clinics and at meetings with different groups of people, including sectoral groups such as the IFA and trade unions. I also visit schools and colleges regularly and, in addition, I have a network of offices around Munster, in Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, Waterford and Limerick. I had an office in Clare until that county was taken out of the Munster constituency. I also have a freefone number that people can call to contact me, as well as being on the Internet. I am amazed at how the number of requests for information and representation increases when I visit a given area, although it tends to level off afterwards. That shows that the more one works, the more work one will find.I am a great believer in maintaining that link with democracy. I have been fortunate that, during my nine years as a Member of the European Parliament, local and national representatives in Munster have been very co-operative and helpful to me in arranging meetings and in facilitating groups to see me. I hope they feel that their assistance has been reciprocated. I do not see myself as working in isolation in the European Parliament, but as part of the tripartite partnership between local, national and European representatives to provide the best possible deal for Ireland and for the people I represent.Senator Brady asked about European legislation. When I receive these vast tomes from the European Commission concerning proposed legislation, my first thought is what it will mean for Cork, Munster or Ireland generally. If the proposed legislation concerns an area in which someone at home is involved, I will ring him or her to ask his or her advice about what might happen if the legislation is introduced. People may say that is very anti-European and I should be looking at the proposed legislation from a European perspective. However, in my experience, if such legislation is wrong for Ballymagash, it is equally wrong for Paris or Berlin. This is not a Boston versus Berlin style argument because if it is wrong in one place, it will be wrong everywhere. Therefore, if we make a mistake and it is not right for Ireland, it will not be right for any other country, although there are specific areas, such as taxation, agriculture and fisheries, where clear distinctions can be drawn between what is right or wrong for different areas.There is no way to streamline or reduce the amount of information that is being given out because we are legislating for 15 countries with a combined population of 350 million people. That will rise to 550 million when enlargement takes place next year so nuances have to be taken into account, particularly with regard to directives more so than with regulations. Regulations are directly applicable as they are written and no changes are made to them. With directives, however, there is a little more leeway for national interpretation in transposing them into domestic law.The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has done a fantastic job in scrutinising EU legislation. Unfortunately, however, there is so much of it and there is no way to reduce it unless member states take back from the European Union the right to initiate certain legislation, which may happen. I will not get into the question of stem cell research, unless Members wish me to do so.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	274	There is a European negotiating position on this issue and the Court of Justice has given the European Commission the right to negotiate it on behalf of all member states. I believe the Commissioner for Transport, Loyola de Palacio, will be sympathetic towards ensuring the continuation of the special position of Shannon Airport. Shannon is unique in Europe not just because of what it represents as having been the first airport of its type and because it is our nearest air link to the American Continent, but also because of its important role in industrial development in the mid-west. I am sure special allowances will be made for it. People may have concerns but, as I said at the outset, we should operate to our strengths, not our weaknesses. Shannon will prosper and grow provided it adopts the right attitude to the opportunities that will be presented to it.The first big challenge for the Irish Presidency next year will be the new European constitution. They could achieve a deal this weekend and I may be proven wrong, but I believe that it will overlap into the Irish Presidency. Even more important is the enlargement of the EU to include ten new countries. It will be phenomenally difficult logistically and economically, but we know in our hearts that it is the right thing to do. It will provide the greatest impetus for the development of the new European Union for the 21st century and will be as important as the creation of the European Community back in the 1950s.The Irish Presidency will have to guide us through many sticky pieces of legislation that are currently being discussed by the European Parliament and on which no agreement has yet been reached. Last week, I met a delegation from the Parliament's legal affairs and Internal Market committee, which had discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern. The week before, I met with a delegation from the Parliament's committee on employment and social affairs. A number of issues arose from both meetings that will arrive on the desk of the Irish Presidency for decision next year. I have great respect for the capacity not only of the Irish officials involved, but in particular the Irish Ministers to find the political compromise that will be required to get that legislation through.I realise that Senators have other matters to deal with and I wish to thank the Leader for inviting me to address the House.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I am glad of the opportunity to raise the case of Mr. Roger Collins who is currently incarcerated in a jail in Georgia in the United States. He has been awaiting execution on death row for the past 26 years. This case was brought to my attention as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs's sub-committee on human rights. Some months ago the sub-committee heard a presentation from a group opposed to the death penalty, whose chairperson is based in Portlaoise. The group is particularly concerned about the case of Mr. Roger Collins. As a 17 year old, Mr. Collins was involved in an incident which resulted in a young lady being murdered in Georgia. Three persons were involved in the incident, but Mr. Collins was not directly involved in the murder. The other two involved in the incident have been sentenced but did not receive the death penalty. The case has been strongly made that Mr. Collins, who was classified at the time as being mentally retarded, was not adequately represented at the original trial. Apparently his legal representative was paid the sum total of $500 for representing him. The other two defendants, who appeared to have significantly more resources available to them, were apparently better defended and their sentences, while severe, as they should have been, did not result in the death sentence being applied.The argument being put forward not just by Mr. Collins, but by those who believe we should intervene to save his life, is that he does not claim innocence and he appreciates fully that he was involved in a dreadful crime. The question we must ask is whether 26 years on death row, with an execution sentence still hanging over him, is justice or vengeance. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, and his colleague at the Department of Foreign Affairs, to make urgent representations to the appropriate authorities asking that clemency be exercised.It was the unanimous view of the Oireachtas sub-committee on human rights that we should make this case to the governor of Georgia, which we did by way of formal letter. To date, we have not received any substantive response and I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices with what he considers to be the most appropriate and the highest possible authority in the United States to take up this case.In this House, throughout the country and the European Union the issue of the death penalty is one on which we have a singular view. We oppose the use of the death penalty. Unfortunately, we could take up hundreds of cases currently awaiting conclusion in the United States, but the case of Mr. Roger Collins, who was little more than a minor when the crime was committed and when he was convicted, a person who clearly suffered profound mental difficulties and who had a very troubled life as a young child and who appears not to have got proper legal representation during the crucial trial period, must be examined in an urgent fashion. I appeal to the Minister of State to take up the case and request that clemency be granted.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I thank Senator Bradford for raising this matter on the Adjournment. In the first instance I wish to reaffirm the position of the Government regarding the death penalty; we are adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances in any part of the world. We believe its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.The House will be aware of the efforts we have made, in conjunction with our EU partners and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty, to seek the universal abolition of the death penalty. The EU has pressed for abolition and has also issued démarches on the use of the death penalty in many countries. In the recent past, démarches have been made in the United States, in accordance with EU guidelines, at both federal and state level, on behalf of a number of individuals. The European Union has also raised the issue in its human rights troika meetings with the US.The EU guidelines adopted in 1998 set out clearly the common EU position on the use of the death penalty. These guidelines now form the basis for Ireland's concerted interventions, along with other EU member states, in death penalty issues. The objectives of the guidelines are to work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty and, in countries which maintain the death penalty, to call for its use to be progressively restricted and for the strict conditions set forth in international human rights instruments on the use of capital punishment to be respected.The abolition of the death penalty is a political priority for Ireland and our EU partners. Ireland, along with our EU partners, will continue to engage in dialogue with the US authorities to seek abolition of the death penalty and is seeking, in the interim, the introduction of moratoria at state level and the reintroduction of the de facto moratorium at federal level. Internationally, we will continue our efforts, with our EU partners, to seek the universal abolition of the death penalty.The case of Mr. Roger Collins was raised at the Oireachtas sub-committee on human rights in April and was the subject of a Dáil question as recently as last month. Mr. Collins is currently on death row in the state of Georgia, having been sentenced to death in 1978. He and two others were convicted of the murder and rape of a female acquaintance. Two other men were convicted with Mr. Collins but they are now free – one has been given immunity while the other was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and has been released.Those seeking clemency for Mr. Collins do so on a number of grounds, including his age at the time the offence was committed, the inadequacy of his legal representation and the length of time that has passed since his sentence. They also believe Mr. Collins could benefit from provisions of Georgia law that provide for a retrial in cases of mental retardation. Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs have sought clarification of the details of this case to see if it comes within the criteria for intervention set out in the EU guidelines on the death penalty. It would appear there is some doubt about some of the grounds put forward. For example, there are strong grounds to believe Mr. Collins was not a juvenile at the time the offence was committed.We have also received information from sources opposed to the death penalty that the burden of proof required to obtain a retrial on grounds of mental retardation is so high it is unlikely it could be met in this case. Nevertheless, other grounds set out in the EU criteria appear to be met, notably in relation to the length of time he has spent on death row.In any event, the Government's view is that no person should be executed since the death penalty, in and of itself, is abhorrent and contrary to human dignity. Accordingly, the Government will convey the concerns of this House to the US authorities through our embassy in Washington.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I am delighted the Minister of State is in the House this evening because he has direct responsibility for the topic I want to discuss.EU Directive 2001/29/EC was brought forward to protect copyright, but the importance of access to the information society was also addressed in the directive. I have some concerns regarding the regulations the Minister is about to introduce. I have seen them in draft form and they may, in some instances, limit access which should be legally available. For example, S.I. No. 406 of 2000 permits organisations to make adapted copies for the disabled, but does not allow the individual disabled person to do so unless it is for research or private study. For example, a blind person cannot put a book on their own scanner and make an aural copy for themselves. A deaf person cannot turn a tape into print. These are one-off copies. They are for their own use but for interest or entertainment. As I said, they can only do it if it is for research or private study. They can obtain copies by going to an organisation. All this seems rather patronising and belittling when disabled people themselves, and we as a society, are encouraging them to be more independent. Surely this can be changed. It will not cost anyone any money.This is an inadvertent omission. The directive allows a simple change from obsolescent hardware and software to updated forms, but the regulations do not address that point. Rapidly changing technology could allow a situation to arise where it is impossible to access information even though one has permission to do so. I urge the Minister of State to implement the provisions of the directive regarding format shifting to avoid people running into serious trouble accessing information.Technological protection measures are very important. One must accept the need, therefore, for breaks or inhibitions on access to information, but a supplier must make available a means whereby a legitimate user can avail of their rights to access a document and this is provided under the legislation. The problem, however, is that if the supplier does not comply, there is no means of redress except recourse to the High Court under the regulation. That would be very expensive and time consuming for anyone who already has a legal right to get the information.Would it not be possible for the person to sign a statutory declaration as to their interests and bona fides before a public notary or peace commissioner? I understand one is allowed to do this in respect of telecommunications licences for deflectors and that this is already possible in the Department.When we discussed this extensive legislation with the former Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Tom Kitt, we agreed that a blanket obligation on all libraries to charge for copies under the library exemptions was introduced solely for the benefit of libraries. I remember pointing out that it could cost libraries more than they could hope to collect, especially when dealing with students. As I recall, the Minister of State indicated he would remove the obligation when the opportunity arose. I assure the Minister of State present that some libraries are not in a position to enforce the charges and ask him to transform the obligation into an option, now that we have the opportunity to do so. The directive seeks to promote access to the information technology society, while regulating it. I am sure this, rather than a limitation on legal access, is what the Minister of State wants.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I thank Senator Henry and other Senators who have made a positive contribution to the development of debate on this important area of the law in the context of debate on what is now the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, and on subsequent occasions. Senators will recall that the 2000 Act aimed, among other things, to implement in law the requirements of a number of international agreements affecting copyright law. Among these were new treaties on copyright and rights in performances and phonograms agreed by the member nations of the World Intellectual Property Organisation in 1996. This objective was shared by the directive on copyright in the information society, which is cited under its official reference by Senator Henry in the area of European Community law.Bearing in mind this common objective, it was possible for the Government to anticipate most of the content of the information society directive in drafting and developing, with the aid of the Houses, the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. A minute examination of the relevant sections of the Act in conjunction with the directive, conducted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, has confirmed that this important objective was achieved.As to the upcoming European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2003, this is a limited legal instrument, designed to make only those changes absolutely necessary to address those few areas in which our efforts to anticipate the final form of the directive in the 2000 Act were not fully successful. The Department is advised by the Office of the Attorney General that the inclusion of any changes extending in the least way beyond this absolute necessity would exceed the powers conveyed by the European Communities Act to make secondary legislation of this sort, a circumstance which, as guardians of the primary legislative process, Members will understand.In consequence, the scope of the proposed regulations is necessarily local and limited. It principally amends an exception allowing transient or incidental copies of protected materials, such as screen copies of literary works or technical copies made in the course of Internet operations, to be made without infringement of copyright. This essentially technical amendment is required because the current Irish exception is significantly different from the version in the directive and the directive makes this exception mandatory in its current form.The other important change contained in the proposed regulations will allow the beneficiaries of copyright exceptions, who are unable to access protected materials because of the use by rightsholders of technological protection measures such as encryption, to apply to the courts to obtain the means of access, for example, a smart card. Again, the changes involved are made necessary by substantive differences between the directive and existing Irish provisions.As to whether the proposed European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2003 are in line with the spirit of the information society directive, this needs to be considered in the context of the existing background provided by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. Apart from the aim of implementing particular instruments of international law, both the directive and the Act share the objective of putting in place a strong, balanced regime of protection for copyright and related rights at their own levels, systems capable of fully meeting the challenges of the information society. The making of the proposed regulations will be a small but necessary step in ensuring that Ireland maintains its current place among world leaders in the field of copyright protection and, in this regard, is fully in line with the information society directive in spirit and in letter.I emphasise that neither the enactment of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, nor the making of the proposed 2003 regulation represent any final word in the development of Irish copyright law. The Government claims no monopoly of wisdom on copyright and I am more than happy to consider proposals brought forward by Members of the Oireachtas or other interested parties for future revisions and reforms, remembering always that such changes must be consistent with Ireland's obligations under European Community and international law. For the time being, however, it is imperative that an instrument on the lines of the proposed European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2003 be made in the immediate future to secure full, basic compliance with the information society directive on the few outstanding points.I thank Senator Henry for her continuing constructive interest in copyright and related rights matters, and look forward to further positive contributions by Senators towards this ongoing debate, which is of such importance for the prosperity of Ireland in the cultural and the economic spheres.

In view of his gracious statement that the Government claims no monopoly of wisdom on copyright, perhaps he will re-examine the position, particularly with regard to disabled people, changes from an obsolete to a modern format and the possibility of allowing sworn public declarations to be made before a notary.The Seanad adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 11.45 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 December 2003.
