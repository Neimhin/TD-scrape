I understand the reply to the question was made available to some journalists as early as 4.30 p.m. yesterday and was the subject of a briefing. Is it in order for replies to questions to be released to journalists or anyone else before they are made available to the Members who ask the questions? In your capacity of protecting the interests of Members of the House, will you, a Cheann Comhairle, seek an explanation from the Taoiseach as to why that was done?</p>

Legislation to establish the health information and quality authority, and the Irish social services inspectorate on a statutory basis was promised for this year. I note, however, that it is now scheduled for 2006. On the last occasion I raised this delay, the Tánaiste said it was due to the fact that legislation was necessary to process the establishment of the HSE. She said the health Bill and other Bills, including the nurses Bill, were being delayed as a result. The HSE is now long established so I would like to know what is the barrier to progressing this legislation in the Department of Health and Children.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_201">Prior to the Private Members' motion, I spoke for a few minutes last night on this important Bill. I was talking of the reversal we have seen and the phenomenon of immigration. We now have net immigration. Some 137,000 migrants now work in Ireland, representing 7% of our labour force. Over the period 2000 to 2005, more than 100,000 people from outside the European Union came to Ireland for employment purposes. This is in addition to the substantial number of EU nationals who have also come here over the past few years. Some 90,000 people applied for PPS numbers since 1 May 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">It must therefore be acknowledged that migrant workers have played a vital role in Ireland's economic prosperity. Our future expansion is dependent on the availability of labour force. Forfás recently concluded that 420,000 new workers will be required by 2010 and that apart from immigration, other sources of additional labour are reducing resulting in a requirement for significant immigration levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">This is particularly relevant taking into consideration Ireland's demographics. Like many European countries, Ireland has an ageing population, a rising dependency ratio, a shrinking indigenous workforce and changing employment and work patterns. This contributes to the context where migrant labour is essential to sustain economic and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Our former party leader John Bruton, now head of the European Commission delegation in Washington, was recently quoted as saying that the economic stagnation of Japan, which does not allow for immigration, contrasts with the dynamism of the US, which has a long history of reaching out to immigrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">It surprises me that Ministers in the current Government are taking such a cautious approach to this Bill. They are of an age to remember when emigration from Ireland was a serious issue and when the progressive policies of host countries took some of the pressure off Irish dole queues, saving the Exchequer much-needed funds. I remember when I was in primary school. There were 12 or 14 of us in sixth class, of whom some seven or eight went to England. Many of them stayed there working and did very well for themselves. They were received quite well. Some returned home later.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">We now see the plight of Irish emigrants in America. Their situation requires some regularisation. Some of the previous speakers, including Deputies Connaughton and Deenihan, raised this issue yesterday. Deputy Connaughton headed a group of Fine Gael Deputies who travelled to the US — as did some Deputies on the Government side — to see if they could help regularise the situation whereby many Irish in the US are living in fear, particularly since 11 September 2001. They cannot return home to family celebrations, weddings and so on. People from my parish have been unable to return for the funerals of their mothers and fathers. I hope the Kennedy-McCain Bill will deal with that issue so that the Irish who live in America can do so in peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Given that some members of the present Government, or people related to them, worked in other jurisdictions where work permits were required, it is surprising that a more enlightened approach was not taken in drafting this Bill. The legislation does not allow for a green card system, as mentioned yesterday, although it is being flagged as such. It is far from that. A green card system provides for an economic route to becoming a full citizen of the US. The Bill provides for an open-ended work permit and it is unfortunate that we use the green card reference in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">We all remember the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, when he was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, using the term "zero tolerance" to describe his approach to crime prevention. Importing such phrases from the US and then stripping them of meaning is not helpful in these situations. I remind the Minister that green cards were promoted by friends of Ireland such as the former US Congressman, Bruce Morrison, who has done so much for the illegal Irish in America and has countered the green card "spin" put on current matters. In June, Bruce Morrison said he did not want to see Ireland using the term "green card" when it means a work permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The proposed green card system would be more appropriately termed a red card system because it stops people getting Irish citizenship by putting obstacles in the way. It has been suggested that an apartheid-type system would be introduced in which those earning more than €55,000 would be eligible for this so-called green card. This is a shocking basis on which to differentiate between people. It brings to mind the discredited and shameful passports for investment scheme which only officially ended recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">There are two schemes — the work permit scheme and the work visa scheme. Under the latter the Government advertises for skilled workers to come here, particularly people in the medical professions. These people can bring their spouses but those on the work permit scheme cannot. Few people in that scheme earn €55,000 per annum or more so this should be addressed. It is not just the amount that is involved, which is far removed from the average industrial wage, but the use of salary scales is dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I am disappointed with other parts of the Bill and the attempts to regularise the chaotic situation that exists with work permits and work visas. The Bill does not go far enough to provide an equitable system of immigration which gives due rights to immigrants. There is a begrudging attitude towards family life. In some circles, the migrant is seen as an economic quick fix. The Bill should refer to the rights of spouses and of other family members to visit or reside here. The migrant is stripped of all social context in this regard. If the idea is to attract skilled workers into the country to drive the economy and to be an engine for growth, the Bill in its current form will fail. Many of the economic migrant workers will vote with their feet and will probably look elsewhere for work when they feel the chill wind of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">A huge number of workers will be needed in this country in the next few years. Deputy Hogan said yesterday that the Republic's population is expected to jump from the current level of 4 million to 5.5 million by 2030. Projected births will average 63,300 annually and deaths will average 32,400 leading to an annual increase in population of only 30,900. That is the reason migrant workers will be badly needed. It also appears that workers on higher incomes will have more rights and entitlements while workers on low incomes will continue to find themselves vulnerable. All, however, will find it difficult to have family members join them or to freely move around and search for better employment and greater security of residence.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The allowing of employers to retain control over permit applications is an unwelcome aspect of the Bill, it must be re-examined. A minority of employers will be able to use the annual permit renewal system as a means of controlling the employee. Others will be frustrated with the bureaucracy of annually re-applying for work permits.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Under the Minister's proposals, a worker can ask another employer to seek a permit for him or her. That could not happen previously when the original employer held the permit. However, that employer can seek a reference from the former employer and if the former employer does not like the migrant worker, he can prevent the worker from getting that job. That is worrying too.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The situation can be reversed. Recently, two employers came to me about this issue. One was in the catering sector, where many of the migrant workers are employed. He had an employee who was very good and he was anxious to retain her. He advertised in FÁS and did the usual things in an effort to get the permit. He could not get anybody but the Department refused a permit and, as a result, that migrant worker lost her job. The other situation involved a specialist karate club in my constituency. An expert in karate and martial arts, who was American, could not get a permit because the Department said he was not an expert and told the employer to recruit an expert in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Overall, the legislation is a recipe for a black economy of unregistered migrant workers working illegally, with all the social misery and exploitation this creates. The Minister should be aware that many illegal workers in the State once operated within the permit system before falling foul of it. I am not confident the Bill's provisions will plug the gaps in the existing permit system.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">There are provisions in the Bill which are welcome, particularly the protections for migrant workers which prohibit employers from deducting expenses associated with recruitment from the employee's wages and from retaining the personal documents of the employee. The Minister said this will offer greater protection and mobility to the employee. However, the Bill offers no protection in terms of becoming undocumented as a migrant worker in Ireland, with little mobility in accessing employment. The inflexible nature of the current work permit system has constantly been cited as a reason for migrant workers falling out of the system and becoming undocumented.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Much of the Bill is welcome but there are provisions which are short sighted in scope and unrealistic in application. There are no proposals in the Bill as to how penalties will be implemented or enforced. As usual, lip service is paid to this activity but there is nothing on the ground. There are not enough relevant inspectorates. That area is under resourced. The aspiration is not to rock the boat too much.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Yesterday, Deputy Hogan referred to the Polish edition of <i>Newsweek</i>. Poles are EU citizens so their circumstances are different but the magazine reported that Ireland was a living hell for many of them. They arrive here expecting to be able to choose jobs instead of finding themselves sleeping rough and living on charity. According to the Polish Embassy there are approximately 10,000 Poles living here.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">On Committee Stage the Minister should take a flexible approach to the concerns raised by the Opposition. Otherwise, whatever merit the Bill has will be lost and it will only be effective in keeping people away from this country or shunting them into the black economy rather than achieving the opposite. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I hope the Minister will deal with the Opposition's concerns on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Ms Cooper-Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_221">I am happy to have an opportunity to speak on this legislation. It is probably overdue. Members have been alerted to various incidents involving migrant workers that have occurred over the last year. Many of the improvements I had hoped for with regard to the work permit system have been incorporated into the Bill and I welcome those changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I recall the debate that preceded the entry of the ten accession countries into the EU last year. A feature of that debate was how many people would come to Ireland as a result. The Minister said that approximately 90,000 people have come to this country. This is more than I had anticipated but perhaps some of those only came for short-term or holiday periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">This significant number indicates the need for change in the open door policy given that many jobs are being filled by EU citizens. Migrant workers had filled a need. The total of 48,000 in 2003 had dropped by the end of September 2004 to 20,400, of which only 6,000 were new work permits. This seems to indicate that approximately 15,000 people are operating under the former work permit system. Is it known how many migrant workers are in the country without valid work permits? I presume the Department has a system of registration. It has come to my attention that many people are undocumented and it is important to have this information. The country has a total of 150,000 migrant workers, from over 100 different countries which is 8% of the workforce and it shows that Ireland has become cosmopolitan in its labour force.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I welcome many of the changes proposed in the Bill. It is proposed to upskill the workforce, maximise the potential of the EU and move the Irish economy towards one that is both innovation driven and knowledge-based in the development of a strategic skilled-based immigration policy. I agree with the focus of the Minister's policy which has the job offer as its core rather than a quota or points system which is used in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The Minister referred in his contribution to the green card system. He proposes that green cards will be issued for an initial period of two years with the possibility of permanent or long-term residence. It is proposed that workers will be allowed bring their spouses and families without delay. What proposals has the Minister for the children of such families who eventually complete their education and may be in their early 20s? Are such children also entitled to permanent residence?</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I am grateful for the Minister's clarification. This anomaly has arisen in a number of cases where migrant workers have been resident in the country for a number of years and where a child of such a worker having completed third-level education on a student visa has found himself or herself in a form of limbo.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I am familiar with the work permit system because I have had occasion to purchase a work permit, the current cost of which is €500. The Minister proposes a new system of issuing permits for two or three years at a cost of €1,000 or €1,500. Why is it necessary to increase the cost?</p>

          <p eId="para_230">The Bill proposes to grant work permits for a two year period at the same fee of €500 per year, which is €1,000 for two years and €1,500 for three years. Why is it not a once-off administration cost?</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>

          <from>Ms Cooper-Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_232">The purchase of a work permit is an expensive cost for many employers and they may also be required to purchase visas on a six-monthly basis, which is another €100. I question the need for multiplying the cost and it could be perceived as a money racket. I appreciate the administrative work must be done but I argue the same amount of work is involved in granting a permit for two or three years as for one year.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I welcome the proposals for the protection of migrant workers. County Mayo has a non-national population of Latvians, Filipinos and many Polish workers from the EU. It has come to my attention through my constituency work that some of these workers have not been content in their employment. The existing work permit system is a form of being sold into slavery because the worker is tied to one employer and cannot move. I am aware of cases where workers have found another job but with the consent of the employer and where they were granted a new work permit with a new employer. However, if relations between an employer and an employee are hostile, this solution cannot be achieved. Many people as a result left their jobs and have remained in the country as undocumented persons. This is the reason for my question as to the statistics available on those numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I stress the importance of informing newly arrived migrant workers of their rights regarding the minimum wage and the work they have been permitted to undertake. The proposal to include such information on the work permit is to be welcomed. The Bill will prohibit employers from deducting expenses associated with recruitment and remuneration and from retaining documentation. I regard the practice of the retention of documents, such as a passport, by the employer as quite disgusting. Under the current system a work permit is issued to the employer. The Bill proposes that the work permit will be held by the employee with a copy provided to the employer and this is to be welcomed. Some migrant workers are better informed than others as to their rights. However, the existence of a network of information within national communities allows workers to become well informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Several television programmes, such as "Prime Time", have highlighted the mistreatment of migrant workers. I welcome the Minister's proposal to improve the inspectorate in order to tackle the mistreatment of workers. It is to be hoped there will be sufficient inspectors to carry out this work. Unless some penalties are attached to abuse of the legislation it will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I refer to section 19(4) which deals with renewals of work permits. It states that in an application for renewal of a permit for a person who has been working here for five years or more, the period for which the permit may be renewed on foot of that application may be unlimited. If a person is here for more than five years, is it the Minister's intention to grant them a permanent work permit and full residency status?</p>

          <p eId="para_238">They will have an automatic entitlement, assuming they fulfil all the criteria and this is to be welcomed. If a person has worked satisfactorily here for five years, it would be desirable for them to be granted leave to remain on a permanent basis. I am grateful for the Minister's clarification as I have been asked this question by migrant workers. I welcome the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Mr. G. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_239">I welcome the provisions of the Employment Permits Bill 2005 as they are long overdue. While many of the provisions are welcome, the Fine Gael view is that the Bill does not go far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Bill and the publicity it has received is totally misleading. Headlines such as "Immigrant workers to get work permits" are misleading. The reality is they will get a copy of the work permit which the employer has received, which is a long way from a situation where the migrant worker has the right to apply for his or her own permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The issue here is the ability to transfer from one employer to another but, to a large extent, the employer is still in control. This must be understood in the context of non-English speaking immigrant workers in a strange country where the customs and institutions are an unknown quantity. Even if their rights are clearly spelled out to them in their native language, if they leave the employer who holds their permit, their lack of understanding of the system and the lack of a complaints or appeal structure will ensure that they are afraid to exercise those rights. Unscrupulous employers will continue to abuse migrant workers, even if we have ten times the current number of inspectors. Many migrant workers, even though they are being grossly exploited by our standards, prefer not to rock the boat because no matter how badly paid or treated they are, they will still consider it better than being deported from this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Work permits are issued on a one-year basis only and it is the employer who must apply for a renewal. We have all heard of migrant workers being told by their employers that an application for renewal had been made, only to discover some months later that this was not the case. Then the workers had to either work illegally in this country or return home.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">If the Minister insists on continuing to tie the permit to employers, then he must put some obligations on them to formally notify immigrant workers, at least three months before the expiry of the permit, of their intentions regarding the application for renewal. There should be an obligation on employers to honour a commitment made in writing on their intention to apply for another permit. If employers fail to honour this commitment, they should be forced to pay compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">One of the flaws of the Bill before us is that it is not clear what penalties will be imposed on employers if they do not comply with the regulations. We cannot have a situation where, in the last few days of his or her first year here, the immigrant worker suddenly discovers that the employer has not re-applied for a permit. Most migrant workers have arrived from poorer countries and many of them send much of their earnings home to support their families. Therefore, it is not acceptable that unscrupulous employers could leave them high and dry, without any notice. In such circumstances, it is absolutely essential that the employer be held responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">If the permits remain in the control of the employer then this Bill must impose stringent obligations and penalties for failure to honour obligations. When we, as a country, make efforts to improve the lot of our undocumented citizens in the United States or Australia, we would not and, indeed, should not accept this type of indentured work for our people. Yet, for some reason, we are quite happy to impose restrictions on migrant workers coming to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Despite all of the debate about the employer's control of the work permit and the long list of injustices such a system has caused, the Minister still persists with this system in this Bill. I hope he has some extremely good reasons for doing so or else that he will reconsider the situation on Committee Stage and accept some amendments to change the system. Some measures in the Bill might prevent the excessive exploitation of workers that we have seen to date but there is no doubt that exploitation will continue as long as the employer controls the permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Everyone agrees that migrant workers have contributed immensely to our economy in recent years and most economists predict that, with projected growth rates of between 4% and 5% in the coming years, we will continue to need more migrant workers to sustain our economy. The fact that the work permit is held by the employer is one of the biggest problems facing migrant workers. The next most serious problem for them is their inability to obtain permission to bring their immediate families here to live with them. Repeatedly, they are asked to prove that they are economically capable of looking after their families. Some have, through sheer hard work, saved up to €20,000 but are still told by the authorities here that they do not satisfy the criteria and will not get permission to bring their families here to live with them. I have heard of many such cases in my constituency. It has been a nightmare for some heads of households trying to bring their families here. They have had to apply many times before succeeding. There did not seem to be any definite criteria or any fixed amount of money required to be on deposit in their bank accounts and the granting of permission seemed to be totally at the whim of some official.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">This situation makes no sense. Allowing good, hardworking people to have their families with them would be of benefit to this country. It would add to the stability of the workers' lives and help them to integrate more into our society. We must accept that if we allow migrant workers into this country for our own selfish reasons — to sustain and expand our economy — we must also extend to them the most basic of human rights. They must have the right to move from employer to employer and, above all, the right to live with their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">We must change our attitude towards workers and also towards visitors from the countries where the migrant workers originate. We must accept that their families will move and live here, their children will become part of our society and their extended families and friends will come to visit them. Most public representatives in this House have heard horrendous stories of people arriving at airports to visit family members who are living legally in this country, who are married to Irish people and who have children by Irish citizens being embarrassed and humiliated at airports and, at times, refused entry.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The Minister is producing a guide to rights in eight or ten languages, which gives us a clear indication of the countries of origin of the majority of migrant workers. There should be a review of our embassy structures in these countries. Facilities should be put in place in each embassy to vet and issue visiting or holiday visas to the extended families and friends of migrant workers living here. Of course, controls are necessary but having a visa process in place in the country of origin will ensure that only genuine holiday makers, visitors, friends and families of migrant workers will arrive at our airports. With proper documentation obtained from Irish embassies in the country of origin, there should be no confusion for people arriving on this island. They should receive the traditional Irish welcome, not an interrogation at their point of arrival. This should be done not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because it will benefit us in the long term. Many of these countries, as has happened in Ireland, will improve economically and then we will be glad of their custom and their trade. We must also accept that when we invite workers into this country, just as our own experience in the US, England and Australia, many families will remain. While, like us, they will be proud of their ethnic background they, and particularly their children and grandchildren, will become every bit as Irish as the Irish themselves. They will become involved in our culture and sports. Just as the Irish integrated into society in England and the US, migrant workers and their families will become part and parcel of our society. Given our history, it is difficult to understand how so many Irish people are finding the whole concept difficult to grapple with. Perhaps over the past 50 years, those who remained in Ireland and were not forced to emigrate were the lucky ones. Yet, we should all know from our parishes and local areas, whole communities that set up in places like Boston, Chicago, New York, London and Sydney.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Of course, a balance must be kept, and I am sure the Bill will help to achieve this. It is only natural for Irish workers to feel some insecurity when they see actions like those taken by Irish Ferries. They know that in recent years unscrupulous employers exploited migrant workers and forced a situation that, if left unchecked, would eventually lead to a downward trend in general wages in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">In this regard the Bill is absolutely essential. Not only must it protect the rights of migrant workers, it must instil confidence in Irish people that the immigration process is being controlled in a way that will benefit the economy and not undermine the job prospects of Irish people. This is why enforcement is so important. The Bill itself will be useless if it is not enforced properly. There must be inspectors to ensure the rights of immigrant workers and to track down and prosecute unscrupulous employers. There must be constant monitoring by the Minister and his Department to ensure quotas are kept at a level in each sector that guarantees the continued expansion of the economy without infringing on the job prospects of Irish people. This may be where the real problem will arise. At this stage, the electorate has little confidence in the Government to get anything right. It has justifiably gained the reputation of continually passing laws without putting in place any resources to ensure their implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Our country and economy need migrant workers to survive and grow. The system must be fair and attractive to these workers, yet it must be controlled. In order to do so, we must face up to the residency problem. We must accept that after a certain number of years working and contributing to our economy, workers and their families must get permanent rights of residency. Without attractive conditions, we will not attract the calibre of worker the economy needs. Almost every other country in the world has a system of naturalisation after a certain period. It is time for us to face up to this issue and include it in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The green card system allows individuals to apply for their own work permit and choose their employer. Immigrants that fall into this category have served us extremely well over the years, particularly in the medical profession, including doctors, nurses and paramedics. Many of our county and smaller hospitals could not operate or exist without their presence. We are experiencing skills shortages in a wider range of professions and we desperately need to attract these professionals. However, we are still at a disadvantage, even with this Bill, as there is no clear route for these people to immediately bring their families to live with them here. This is not the case in other countries with which we are competing for these skills. There is a need to deal with this issue now or it will not matter how many green cards the Minister is prepared to issue, as there will not be enough people to take them up if the conditions are not suitable and acceptable to these workers and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I remind the Minister that, apart from migrant workers and green card holders, we have a serious problem to deal with. Since the expansion of the European Union, many thousands of eastern Europeans have legally, and without restriction, become part of our workforce, and rightly so. Each Member knows of far too many cases of exploitation of these workers. Serious concerns were raised recently by the Polish authorities about the treatment of their citizens in this country. The same pertains to citizens of many other countries that are now part of the European Union. We have an obligation as fellow Europeans to protect their rights and to ensure their stay in this country is of the same standard we would expect if we travelled to other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">While accepting that all of this is relatively new to us as a nation, there is no excuse for the behaviour of some of our institutions and citizens. The Government across all Departments has a huge job to do in the first instance to educate Irish people on this new phenomenon and to put structures in place in housing, education and integration policies to ensure that, as a nation, we do not fall into the same trap as other nations. We want integration, not ghettoisation. If the Government does not act now on the broader social implications of this inward migration, the cost to us as a nation will be enormous in the years to come. We can deal better with the issue than other countries. We can learn from their mistakes and create a prosperous united country, where everyone can do extremely well.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">As our spokesman, Deputy Hogan, said, Fine Gael broadly welcomes the Second Stage of the Bill. We will table some substantial amendments on Committee Stage and look forward to debating them with the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_258">I wish to share time with Deputy Gilmore.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I have no doubt the role of migrant workers has been widely acknowledged and credited as having had a significant input into the maintenance of our economic boom, which is welcomed by everyone. It is important now to ensure that these migrant workers are given every opportunity to lead a quality of life that we would expect in a similar environment if we were on the other side of the coin.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I broadly welcome the Bill which goes some distance towards improving conditions and setting out standards. However, there are a number of issues I would like to raise. We should look on our migrant workers, not just as economic units and contributors to the workforce, but primarily in terms of their rights and how they may be integrated into our community and society because of the major contribution they are making to our economic boom. We should also consider the rights of these workers' families. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, referred to this yesterday when he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_261">. . . the fundamental principle is the one with which I began, namely that we talk about workers, their families and their rights, internationally. The discussion should be grounded and founded in rights. That is what is contained in the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">This is fundamental to how we behave as a society in treating migrant workers and acknowledging their contribution to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The role of migrant workers in Ireland is widely recognised and applauded by all of us. Tremendous work is done by foreign nurses, particularly Filipinos. They are superb and have provided an excellent, quality service in many hospitals. I have had personal reasons to be very much aware of this in the past year. However, they feel their rights, particularly where they relate to their families, are being eroded. They face difficulties regarding whether their families will be permitted to visit or stay. If we are to applaud the quality of their work, the very least we might do is ensure they also enjoy a decent quality of life and rights of family, as they play a role in our society. We cannot ignore this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I have concerns about the manner in which work permits were issued or denied in the past. Every public representative has come across cases where decisions were taken at the whim of an official, as Deputy Gerard Murphy stated. I was approached by a number of different people regarding one case. An Indian computer analyst wanted to work for a small information technology company in the midlands. The employer was refused a work permit but, following the exploration of various other avenues, the permit was granted. There was no reason for the refusal in the first place or for the subsequent granting of the permit. What was different? While I welcome the outcome, I am concerned about the lack of transparency in these decisions and I wonder whether the permit was granted at the whim of the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Account must be taken of workplace conditions to ensure migrant workers are not exploited. Every public representative has dealt with cases of abuse in the workplace. Migrant workers are exploited, particularly where their knowledge of English is limited or non-existent. They are vulnerable and afraid and they feel they must dance to the tune of the employer. They are not informed about their rights or where they may seek help and the language barrier is enormous. Moves to ensure such exploitation does not recur are welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I welcome the change which provides that a non-national who applies for employment may transfer from one employer to another provided both employers are in the same sector. However, I am concerned that when employers have applied for the permit, non-nationals will not be able to transfer to another employer, even if he operates in the same sector. This means cases such as that involving Gama Construction could arise again. The fear is unscrupulous employers will still be able to threaten termination of a non-national's employment and tell him or her that, unless he or she fulfils certain conditions, his or her employment will be terminated and he or she will not longer be permitted to work in Ireland. How is that an improvement on the current position?</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The legislation will solidify a two-tier system. One tier is for non-nationals who have the required education, skills and means necessary to apply for an employment permit. They will be granted permits which are transferable to other jobs in the same sector, which is good. However, the other tier is for non-nationals whose permits are applied for by an employer who may also be a non-national, as was the case with Gama Construction. Under the legislation, every non-national will have a profession on their work permit but will that make a difference if the non-national whose employer applied for the permit is obliged to surrender it within a month of his or her employment being terminated? I hope I am accurate in this regard but perhaps the Minister will examine the issue. The adoption of a two-tier system is a major concern.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">I welcome a number of positive provisions in the legislation such as making it an offence for an employer to take and keep documents such as passports. Migrant workers are vulnerable and they have sufficient reason to be frightened and scared without their passports being withheld. Those who are considered to be in Ireland illegally may have their status changed, which is also welcome. More migrants workers will be needed in the coming years and the permit process should be as smooth and positive as possible so that they become part of our economy and welcome members of the wider community.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_271">I concur with the observations made by colleagues regarding the shortcomings of the legislation but I will focus on how the work permit regime does not match up with the residency permit regime overseen by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Joined-up Government is needed in this regard. I appreciate this issue does not come under the remit of the Minister but it relates to this legislation which is being promoted on the assumption that Ireland needs immigrant labour in specific industries from which it benefits and it should be facilitated in a regulated way.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I refer to the cases of approximately 250 young adults described as "aged out minors". These young people arrived in Ireland unaccompanied when they were in their early to mid-teens from war-torn countries and other dangerous circumstances. They were sent here by their parents and guardians who did not know what would happen to them but who needed to get their children to a safe place for their own protection. These unaccompanied minors were placed in the hands of the health boards. They were provided with accommodation and placed in schools and colleges to pursue an education. In most cases, they attained the leaving certificate or equivalent qualification and they integrated in local communities. A number of them play various sports and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">However, when they reached the age of 18, they were no longer minors and they became the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, having left the care of the health boards. No decision has been made on whether they can remain in the State. Decisions have been made to issue deportation orders against a number of them. Periodically these young people are summoned to attend the Garda national immigration bureau with what they understand to be the possibility that they will be deported. In a number of cases "aged out minors" as they are called, have been deported. Yesterday I attended a meeting with colleagues from both Houses to make a case for these 250 young people, of whom 150 are in direct provision and of whom 100 are with families or have made independent arrangements. None of them has children or dependants.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The case I wish to make in respect of this Bill is as follows. If this country needs immigrant labour, what sense does it make to order the deportation of these people and look to another channel to bring in immigrant labour? These people have grown from adolescence to adulthood here, have received an education here and are available to work. Apart from the dangers to which these people are exposed in being returned to countries where if they have family they do not know where they are, and in many cases where those countries pose a danger to them, it is not fair on a purely human level that young people who had to leave a country at 14 or 15 years of age, move halfway across the world to a different culture, climate and environment and be educated, should be ripped up and sent back. That is not humane. I do not make this point in an adversarial way. I hope and trust the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will consider the case in a compassionate manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I ask the Minister with responsibility for employment and for employment permit legislation and who rightly justifies that on the basis of our need for immigrant labour, to reconcile with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the requirements for immigrant labour and skills. These people have received a good level of education and are anxious to pursue further education. In some cases they are marooned as they have completed the leaving certificate but cannot do further education courses. If they are doing these it is beneficial but they cannot work and do not know what the future holds.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">This is a case where the requirements of these people need to be examined on a stand alone basis. No precedent is being created, nor are other doors being opened. These people came here, were educated here and they have a contribution to make to Irish society, the community and the economy. That should be valued and they should not be sent back. Many are deeply anxious about what their future holds and the slow grinding of the process does not help. A decision should be made and some political direction needs to be given to the system to clear the decks for the 250 aged out minors. Their residence should be regularised, enabling them to pursue and complete their education, enter employment and make the contribution they are anxious to make to Irish life.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_277">I welcome the legislation. It demonstrates for the first time the value of and need for migrant workers. This is an important signal to communicate but I have concerns that a two-tier system is being created. We seek to employ highly-skilled, well-educated workers yet the same regime does not apply to people lower down the range of skills. The legislation is cautious and conservative and we need to push the boat out further.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">It was suggested that this is a new situation for Ireland and we are only now putting systems in place. In fact, we know a considerable amount on this subject from the other side. We put a great deal of money into our education system and in the 1980s our best educated people, graduates from college, went to Britain and the United States and succeeded. Like most Irish people I had family in that category and the argument was made that this emigration restricted our economic growth as we did not have the skill sets to draw in people. The same argument applies the other way round now. By drawing people from other countries we are creating restrictions in those countries and growth in those economies may be restricted as we receive the brightest and best workers. That we do not cater for people lower on the skills ladder is a problem. It also creates a pull factor, where Ireland is perceived as a place to come to work, yet when people consider this, there is a restriction. I do not say we should have an open door policy but we should have a less restrictive policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">In our economy we are fortunate to have a low level of unemployment. People taking up skills at the bottom tier of the economy are generally non-nationals. They are taking up jobs that Irish nationals do not seek. We should learn from this. The legislation will not change anything for the vast majority of people here or those who seek to come here. I am not opposed to regulation but the matter needs to be considered further.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I wish to address a concept about which Geroge Lee spoke recently. He talked about "growthless" jobs. Some of this can be accounted for by migrant workers. For example, a man who works in the construction industry contacted me. He came here on a permit, with accommodation provided. He works long hours, is a skilled worker and pays taxes. He has a wife and son in another country and sought permission for them to join him. Their application was rejected on the grounds that the wife and son would be an economic drain on the economy. I advised him to represent his case in a different manner as his accommodation is provided. When I teased it out further with him I learned that his employer suggested it was not a good idea for him to declare that because it would be regarded as benefit in kind and he would have to pay more tax on it. Essentially, it is benefit in kind but that man worked for less money, a significant amount of which was sent home to maintain his family. That money was not spent in our economy. My argument is that jobless growth is the result of migration policies, and the example I have given is probably a reasonable one.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I welcome the direction in which the Bill is going but we can only form our opinions based on examples we have been given. I spoke to a family in the past few weeks. The woman is a staff nurse who works both full-time and part-time in different jobs. Her husband is an engineer who expects to take up employment in the next few weeks. They have a child and are living here under the residency rule but they have three other children, aged 9, 13 and 15, living in another country with family members for the past three years. They sought to have those children join them. I would have thought those people would have a good chance of qualifying under the green card system because of the skills set but there is no relaxation in terms of that process and a little common sense needs to be introduced to it. When examining people's applications we should not refuse them if we are going in that direction. These people are here to stay. They are entitled to stay here and to work but the fact that their children cannot joint them is an impediment. I regard it as a cruel policy when it is likely that these people will stay here.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Health care professionals from this country have travelled to countries like India and the Philippines seeking health care workers to join them here. I had the experience earlier this year of having a family member in hospital who was very well cared for by people from India, the Philippines and other countries. We must appreciate the valuable role these people play but we cannot regard migrant workers simply as economic drones. We all function within families and we must appreciate that non-nationals also function within families. We must take a more caring approach to the people we are asking to come here because in many cases we are adding significant stress to their lives by virtue of the fact that they must endure very long separations from their families, which is not a fair approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I welcome the Bill as a first step. It demonstrates the value of migrant workers but I would like it to be amended on later Stages with a view to introducing some relaxation of the rules.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_284">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about this legislation. Unlike other speakers, I want to endorse the words of Deputy Gilmore wherein he indicated that there could and should be a meeting of minds between the two relevant Departments to make the best possible use of the type of people about whom the Deputy spoke. We all have them in our constituencies. It is ironic because they speak with Irish accents yet they are about to be deported because of the type of situation about which Deputy Gilmore spoke. It is daft that that should be the case. Those people have been educated here. They want to continue that education or their work here but their prospects are not good because of the circumstances in which they came here in the first place and the fact that their relatives are in another country.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Another aspect that must be borne in mind is that this economy has adopted a high wage economy policy. I do not necessarily agree with that. There are two sides to that argument. We have seen a considerable amount of relocation to low wage economies in south-east Asia resulting in job losses here. That is unsustainable and it will cause a problem further down the road. In the meantime, there is a possibility that some unscrupulous people will decide to replace that high wage economy with their own low wage economy by utilising non-national workers and paying them less than the going rate. That has a dual negative knock-on effect. First, it contributes to racism and, second, it is unfair. It is grossly unfair that any Irish employer would treat a non-national worker as a second class citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Before continuing I want to compliment those employers who were particularly anxious to care for non-national employees because in them they see a mirror image of themselves, particularly those of them who emigrated from this country in the 1940s and 1950s. There are quite a number of them in the building industry and they now employ people from across the world and give them great care and attention. They look after them as if they were family because they remember that they were in the same circumstances. I compliment those employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I have fewer compliments for some employers who treat their employees badly because they know there is no redress. They are the boss and nothing will change because these non-nationals are far from home and it is too difficult for them to get another job or to get away from their employer because heretofore the work permit process was employer driven. It is hoped that will change now but there are pros and cons either way.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I emphasise, however, that those employers who treat their unfortunate employees badly should be ashamed of themselves and we should be ashamed of them also because they are not doing any good for the country's image. Neither are they doing themselves any good because the wheel always turns. While we may we very affluent and self-sufficient now, there will be other times when that is not the case. As I have often said in this House, if all our emigrants and people of Irish descent across the world were to descend on this island, it would be very crowded. Having said that, the more people we have in the country, the more economical it is to provide goods and services to the people concerned. I do not subscribe to the notion put forward by some people that there is a certain number of people with whom it is comfortable to live and we should not have any more than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">To return to the Bill, regardless of how we go about it difficulties will arise. We have seen abuses in the employer delivered work permit system, and those abuses will continue. A technique must be found whereby the employee can, within reason, relocate to another employer without having to return and re-apply or whatever. I realise that is the proposal but it should be done as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Another aspect about which I am a little concerned is the activities of agencies. The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, made an attack on economic immigrants some time ago. Fortunately, I was not in the committee room at the time because both my parents were economic immigrants at one time, as I am sure were the parents of many of the people in the House. We should never forget where we came from because if we examine our past, it will always tell us something about our future. I completely disagree with the notion that it is a capital offence to be an economic immigrant. People throughout the world have become economic immigrants and people left the shores of this country for economic reasons for generations. Let us be clear about it. We can either accept circumstances as they are or try to change history, but people leaving this country for economic reasons is the way it was here and I hope it will never come to that again.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Many of the poor people who come here seeking employment must pay some intermediary an excessive sum of money, which their families have collected. This is not acceptable. Worse still, many such workers must pay an agency when they arrive. That is reprehensible. Once employment is found the fee is paid and that should be the end of the matter. It should be possible to deal with that in the State agencies such as the Minister's Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, although the latter's role in this process is not always helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">It is important to find a means to ensure that no added penalty is imposed on the employee after employment is found. It should also be possible for the employee to move from one employer to another. That would serve two purposes, namely create competition and help eliminate abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The policy adopted by the United States and Australia some years ago of admitting only those people who had certain skills or could command a certain income, is not the right one for us. The problem here is the reverse of that situation. We require people who will do the jobs many of our people will not do. That is not fair to the employees coming into the country but it is a fact. There are posts in many occupations which are impossible to fill with local employees. The Minister should consider making it easier for poor people from abroad, who are willing to work in these positions, to come here without too much bureaucracy. That problem will persist.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">It is contradictory for industries to relocate from here to low-wage economies while we prevent those who are willing to work in low-wage jobs coming here. Although I have not been in this House as long as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and probably will not be, I am intrigued by some of the contradictions I have seen in my time here. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has seen many more of them. If we do not cater for these industries we will lose them entirely from our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">We have all dealt with situations in which a non-national, married to an Irish citizen, has children who are theoretically the children of an Irish citizen through marriage but are forbidden to enter the country, or find it difficult to enter.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The Department of Social and Family Affairs has a role in this matter. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform also has a role and has introduced rules to the effect that anybody who, as a resident, is likely to impose a burden on the economy is denied entry. That is a contradiction too and is in breach of international law. Anybody in employment who makes social insurance contributions has a right to his or her entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">It is ridiculous to make parish pump laws whereby we accept social insurance contributions, and an employee's contribution to the economy but give nothing to that person when he or she is out of work or between jobs. That proposal is being suggested in respect of economic immigrants from eastern Europe. I am waiting for somebody, including somebody from the new member states of the European Union, to challenge that.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Any citizen of the European Union has a right under EU law to receive his or her entitlements. This applies across Europe and cannot be dispensed with by any country on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Membership of the European Union brings certain obligations and benefits and we cannot switch them on and off as a situation requires.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">We in Ireland are better placed than most others to set a shining example in dealing with work permits for non-national workers. We should show people how we would have liked to see it done because our experiences abroad were not always good. At least we know the difference and should be able to set out how to be fair to those in a less privileged position. We have experienced at first hand the need felt by many of these visitors to our shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Occasionally one hears people say there are too many non-nationals here. That is fine but they are here because we need them to work in our economy. If they do not fill the positions where will we find people to do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The situation at Irish Ferries is most peculiar as it appears to create a second tier of employment in our economy. I do not know what provision covers this but the end seems to justify the means because the company says it will not be viable unless it does this and so the matter is agreed. If that policy is pursued there will be consequences. The company's competitors will start to do likewise which will cause considerable industrial strife in our economy that may spread. I do not accept the case being made for this action. We need to examine it and recognise the likely consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">It is often said of people from low-wage economies working here that they would get very little at home. The theory behind this comment is that these people are lucky to be here working for half the normal wage and should be grateful for that. One could easily apply the argument that we should be grateful they came here to do work nobody else is willing to do and to do it for half the price. However, no one ever seems to want to examine the argument from that perspective. I find it objectionable when someone says that the migrants would earn very little at home, since they would have very few outgoings there either. When they are living and working in Ireland, however, they have the same outgoings as everyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">A considerable number of immigrants have settled down and bought their own homes, despite having great difficulty in securing a loan and so on. They have worked extremely hard to do that. Nothing has been done to ease their path towards obtaining a loan, but they have managed it and they are making a commitment to this economy. They have made their case and set out their stall by deciding on what they want to do and settling and investing here. We should recognise and appreciate that since they have shown not simply a one or two-year commitment but a willingness to work with, through, for and in this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I was recently amazed, speaking to a teacher in a school, to find that leaving certificate students with only two years' education in Irish were able to pass at honours level. It is amazing to think how they dedicated themselves to achieving that. It is an example to everyone else if a child who has had only two years' grinds in the language is able to get right to the top in one fell swoop. We should be grateful of the opportunity to have non-national workers in this country. We should treat them equally and not discriminate against them. We should remember that we provided the same kinds of services and took up the same kinds of employment in other economies for many generations. I hope that we have learnt a great deal from what we saw and suffered during that period and I hope that we will have the magnanimity to ensure that those who work in our economy in similar circumstances are treated in a way that makes us proud. That does not always happen, but we hope that it can be changed.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">While the Bill is a step in the right direction, the Green Party still has very strong concerns. It does not go far enough and today I would like to dwell on three issues. The small print confirms that the work permit is not given directly to the employee, and that must happen. Second, the Bill appears to address only those with higher skills levels. From the newspaper, it seems that the Government is putting out a message that this is for people on higher incomes. However, they are not the only people whom we need.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_307">Third, there is an absence on the Government side of the House of an immigration policy. We need one and we must recognise, nurture and provide for those who come to this country and whom we should welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Regarding the first issue of not giving the work permit directly to the employee, the Government announced this Bill with much fanfare, saying that it would finally give rights to the employee. However, it does not go far enough since one cannot change one's work or move around without going to the employer. Our criticism for several years has been that the type of work permits being granted can often result in workers being treated as little more than indentured servants. One cannot change jobs without going to one's employer nor can one move around without reference to the Government or to one's employer. Even when one applies in the first place, one must supply details of the place of work, the hours, the pay, the employer and so on all down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">I am quite surprised that the Progressive Democrats went along with this since it seems to bring about much more regulation in the area. We need clarity and simplicity, something that party's members have certainly argued for in Government. Frankly, I am surprised that they do not seek a much clearer system. We would like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Immigration is not rocket science; it can be managed quite quickly and easily. First, the Minister should decide what kinds of immigrants Ireland needs, examine best practice abroad, and put a system in place that provides for that. One would work out every year, biennially or triennially what kinds of immigrants we want. One would impose a quota, allow people to apply and provide permission to work in Ireland. It is as simple as that. I am concerned that this system will be bureaucratic and difficult to operate and that it will make it difficult for the employee, leaving him or her vulnerable and not providing the kind of clarity that we need in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I know the kinds of people whom we wish to attract. For instance, in nursing, it seems to me from the various Government pronouncements over recent weeks that they will not get a look in and neither will the kinds of manual labourers whom we need because we cannot fill posts. If one is an information technology professional, one might be able to find one's way through the Bill's hoops, but the signals from the Government do not indicate that we will get the kinds of immigrants whom we need to fill the jobs that companies and employers cannot.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">We must provide decent working conditions for those who come here. If working conditions change, the employee is stuck in Ireland, hundreds, if not thousands, of miles from home, and is not given the right to move employer. That is not right and must change. The Minister has announced 31 new labour inspectors. We still have more dog licence inspectors. It is not good enough and the Minister must re-prioritise and ensure that employers are scrutinised on compliance with labour regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">We hear every day of the week about crazy working conditions and significant abuse of the system. We must send a very clear message to employers that we will monitor working hours and wages and ensure that regulations are honoured. One need only open a newspaper to discover yet more breaches of the law. The labour safety inspectorate recently found that one in eight accidents that occur in the State involved someone from outside Ireland. The figures show that such people are vulnerable. Those are the fellows told to lash up on scaffolding and knock out pipes; an Irishman does not do that. They are vulnerable, in many cases not having insurance or even speaking the language. They are at the beck and call of the employer. This Bill does not address that. We must give employees better rights and ensure that they need not tip their hats to employers. This Bill does not achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">We must also move ahead in honouring international commitments. The United Nations General Assembly adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in 1990, yet we have not even ratified it. Signature is one thing, but ratification is what counts. Given that hundreds of thousands of people have come to Ireland, we must ensure that their rights and those of their families are honoured and vindicated. We support an immigration policy underpinned by a human rights approach that respects the minimum standards set out in international law regarding migrant workers. I do not see that coming through strongly enough in the legislation. We must ensure the kinds of people needed in the Irish economy are attracted here.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I am not convinced such changes are being discussed by the Government. There remains a certain reticence in this regard. We must provide for immigration to fill the vacancies that cannot be filled by Irish workers. In addition, we must recognise, regularise and welcome immigrants. It is a significant change and one that is perhaps easier for people of my generation, many of whom have lived and worked abroad, to accept. Many Irish people in their 30s or 40s were obliged to emigrate 15 or 20 years ago and make a new life in Barcelona, Berlin or Boston. They returned with a willingness and openness in terms of working with people of other nationalities. There may be a reluctance in this regard among those who never left Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I suspect there is a similar reluctance on the part of the Government and it must move beyond its current cautiousness in this area. There is no doubt that there must be careful screening of who can enter and remain in Ireland. However, immigrants who have worked here for four or five years should have a right to residency. This Bill may lead to a situation where we experience the same difficulties as those encountered by Germany in respect of its guest worker system, where people were brought in when times were good but asked to leave, sometimes in a hurry, when times were bad. There is a dangerous resonance there. Migrant workers who contribute to the economy for several years should be allowed to remain, along with their families. We cannot welcome people to the party and then eject them in less prosperous times.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I recognise that the Bill is a practical step forward and I support it in this regard. However, the seminal issue of allowing the employee to work here separately from the employer must be included in the legislation. I look forward to an amendment in this respect.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and the issues of immigration and work permits policy. Legislation in this area is not before time. The Employment Permits Bill 2005 aims primarily to allow the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to grant and refuse work permits and visas for a range of employment categories and to put a legal framework in place to accommodate such activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Ireland is a much changed place in the last 15 years and that process of change continues. There is a generation of young working people who are more ambitious and confident than their predecessors and who expect economic success unknown to previous generations. They are the people who will continue to drive the economy into the future. To sustain such progress, workers from abroad will be required. Within the EU, Ireland is seen as a model for success and people want to come here. As a result, there will be a continuation of the transit of skilled workers from other European countries to experience what we have to offer in terms of quality of life and the job opportunities we continue to create. This has been an inherently positive development. Outside the EU, we are seen as a small country with a large reputation. Ireland has the second highest income <i>per capita</i> in Europe, after Finland, and is seen as a wealthy place of opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">A neutral person might believe I am speaking on behalf of the Government. I refer to the perception of Ireland abroad but there is no doubt that we are not without our problems. In essence, the issue we must deal with in the context of migration policy is the requirement for immigrant workers to facilitate the continued development of the economy. There are some 160,000 immigrant workers in Ireland, comprising 8% of the workforce, and this number will increase. At the same time, Ireland is a destination of choice for many workers and that is a significant advantage in our task. We must develop a sensible, practical and efficient means of aligning our requirement for skilled migrant workers with the desire of many people from other countries to come to Ireland. We have not been particularly successful in this regard heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The legislation proposes three pillars for migration policy, comprising three categories of worker which Ireland wants to attract and each of which will receive different treatment. The concept of attracting workers with a certain skills set to match requirements is welcome. However, I wish to use the opportunity of this debate to raise an issue that must be addressed urgently by the Government. One obvious skills shortage is in the area of medicine. The shortage of doctors is compounded by a third level medical education system which is a farce. The number of places in medicine available to Irish students is restricted because third level institutions are obliged to accommodate a quota of foreign students paying high fees to finance the courses they provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The many foreign students undertaking medical training in Ireland are welcome. However, many of them return home once their education is complete and take their expertise with them. The restriction on the numbers of Irish students taking medical courses is an issue that must be addressed. It may not be the direct responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but it has a role to play in trying to persuade the Department of Education and Science to rectify this restrictive situation for Irish students. The only way to address this problem is by putting more resources into third level medical faculties so that institutions are not required to finance their training by charging foreign students high fees. Something must be done in this regard before we are obliged to recruit even more doctors and medical staff from abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The first pillar of the proposed migration system is the introduction of green cards for people with skills in areas in which there is a shortage of qualified Irish workers. I strongly welcome the concept of a green card system. It is a facility that has been used successfully in other countries and it is not before time that it was introduced here. I object, however, to categorising workers according to ranges of earnings. I do not accept that the main skill set we need consists of those earning more than €60,000 per year. There are just as many sectors with average earnings between €30,000 and €60,000 in respect of which green cards are required. The message we may be sending out is that the more one earns, the more one is valued. I do not support such a policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">However, the introduction of the green card system represents significant progress and I congratulate the Government in this regard. Green cards will allow workers to be mobile in terms of moving from one job to another within their skills set. This is long overdue as opposed to workers being tied to one employer and afraid to object if they are mistreated. I am happy to support the idea of a green card that allows a person to come here and work as long he or she is needed for his or her skill.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The second pillar does not need as much discussion. It is an obvious area that needed revamping. The re-establishment of inter-company transfer systems for temporary transnational management is necessary in a country that has so many foreign employers. Management goes into and out of companies in Ireland on a regular basis. Certainly the pharmaceutical sector in my constituency in Cork is a good example. It is right and proper to allow management move from one company to another should the need arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Pillar three, the meat of this policy, is a work permit scheme for a restricted list of occupants up to an earnings category of €30,000 per year where the shortage is of labour rather than skill. Is it being suggested that those who do not earn €30,000 are not skilled? It may be necessary to revise the language used. While I know what the Minister is trying to say, those who may be earning €27,000 or €28,000 per year may rightly ask if the skill they bring to the job is not valued. I do not know the answer to that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The cost for the first two-year work permit is €1,000 and for a further three-year work permit €1,500. Is there a cost for a green card and, if not, are green cards issued free of charge while there is a charge for work permits? If that is the case the issue needs to be analysed and rebalanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The application procedure to obtain a work permit has been a huge headache for my office in Cork as I am sure it has been many other Deputies. People who may be in Ireland on student visas or on holidays cannot apply for work permits while in Ireland. They need to return home before they can apply to come back again. Is that matter being addressed in the legislation and in the Minister's new plans for a new work permit system? It should be possible for a person who is studying in Ireland and has got a job, a skill that is required and a company that wishes to employ him or her, not to have to return to New Zealand, Australia or South Africa to apply through the embassy to come back to Ireland. That type of nonsense needs to be addressed in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I understand why the Minister may have taken a restrictive approach in the past. There is, however, a need for a flexible system that allows a person who approaches the Department or an employer who wishes to employ him or her to transfer from a student visa to a work permit without the necessity to return home. I ask the Minister to address that issue in his concluding remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The giving of the permit to the employee rather than the employer is welcome. This empowers the employee somewhat, although it does not solve the problem. If a person obtains a work permit he or she is still tied to the job unless he or she goes through the laborious procedure of reapplying for another work permit for another job. The work permit does not provide for labour mobility through the marketplace in the same way as a green card. Why not have a green card system the whole way through for each category? The Minister can still be restrictive as to whom they are issued. Let us have the same standards of mobility for a person who earns €60,000 or more and a person who earns €25,000 to enable the workforce move around.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">For example, if a farm labourer is required for seasonal work he or she should be facilitated in doing that work through a work permit system. Even though that seasonal work may last only six months he or she may be able to slot into a different type of seasonal work on another farm for the other half of the year. Currently, to facilitate that type of work mobility that person, in co-operation with an employer, must apply for a new work permit for the second six months. That is a practical example but there are many more.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I welcome the fact the Government is toughening up on those who breach legislation in this area. Those who exploit migrant workers deserve to be treated toughly by Government. Not only have they no respect for those working for them but they have a competitive advantage over other companies which obey the law. That is unacceptable. The matter needs to be addressed by being tough and making an example of people, if necessary, so that the idea of exploiting migrant workers will not be countenanced. If new laws are introduced they will have to be enforced. Unfortunately, there are certain employers throughout the country who are laughing at us and who pay workers far less. That should not happen. I welcome the aspiration to toughen up.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">On the delicate political issue of how asylum seekers are treated the Minister may say this is not an issue for his Department but rather for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I differ with the Minister on that issue. If the State cannot deal with an asylum seeker who has been in Ireland for six to eight months, that person should be allowed work under some form of restricted work permit system to enable them pay their own way. There are many asylum seekers who are highly skilled who are fleeing persecution but it takes the State four to five years to make a decision on their asylum application. In the meantime they have to live in a hostel or social housing when they could and want to pay their own way for themselves and their family.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">An issue that promotes racism is that many asylum seekers who have been in Ireland for four our five years because the State cannot make a decision on their application have nothing to do and give the impression that there are far more of them. They are not integrating into society because they have no work. An opportunity is being missed at a time when many have a skill that will fit into the categories here.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">An Olympic gymnast who had come to Ireland came to me and, like many who are economic migrants rather than asylum seekers, the only way she could remain here was to claim asylum. All will agree that the two issues of economic migrants and asylum seekers need to be separated. She wanted to make the transition from asylum to get a work permit. She was by far the most skilled gymnast in the country and people wanted to employ her in Cork to share her skills as a trainer. She had to be sent back to Romania, a process that took more than two months, where she relinquished her asylum application, applied for a work permit and eventually got back after much negotiation. She is a classic example of somebody who came here to seek asylum because that was the only avenue open to her. She then realised she had gone through the wrong channels, wished to seek a work permit and abandoned her claims for asylum. We should have a flexible system that can deal with such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I am glad the Minister, Deputy Martin, has arrived in the Chamber. He probably did not hear my earlier remarks. While the Bill is welcome in general there are some issues we still need to address. One such issue concerns asylum seekers who have been here for six to eight months or more. The State knows it will take time to assess such asylum applications but if those people have a skills set that fits the categories we want, we should be able to facilitate that transition in their status. I do not buy into the argument that if we do so we will attract more and more asylum seekers, as some people claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The legislation is welcome and not before its time. I am not convinced, however, that we require three separate pillars. We could introduce a green card system for all categories and still be restrictive as regards the skills set we allow to work here. The benefit of that would be proper mobility throughout the work force for people, whether they earn €25,000 or €85,000 a year. We should allow proper work force mobility between jobs, rather than requiring people to re-visit the Department every time they want to change or have a problem with their employer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_338">I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on the Bill. We will have to examine this legislation closely on Committee Stage because more details were announced by the Minister in his speech than appear in the Bill, including the three pillars system. We will have to work on this Bill on an all-party basis during the remaining Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">While I welcome the legislation, the immigration issue has not been dealt with very well by the Government. I have said repeatedly that the Government has not examined the issue over the past three years and has neglected it. In addition to this legislation, the immigration and residence Bill will also come before the House, but since the issues overlap, these measures should be debated together. After five or six years of immense pressure arising from immigration, the Government is dealing with it now when things are beginning to calm down. It is a shame that it took the Government so long to address this matter. Every Deputy has had to deal with such problems in constituency offices. The lack of a proper immigration policy has caused much damage, and not solely concerning work permits. The immigration issue should have been dealt with properly and more clearly before now.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Deputy Coveney referred to racism which has been fuelled by the lack of clear guidance on immigration. I fear this lack of proper guidance has set the foundations for major problems in the years to come. The Government will be to blame for that since it did not act quickly enough. It is not necessarily solely the fault of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment because I agree that there is a cross-over with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The issue touches upon every Department, however, and it has not been addressed. Much of it comes down to begrudgery because Irish people do not know exactly what immigrants are doing here, what they are entitled to do, what they are receiving and whether or not they are working. There has been a lack of clarity, information and advice. I hope we will not be discussing such failures in five years' time when other problems arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Many refugees and asylum seekers have been waiting three, four or five years for a response to their applications, informing them whether they may remain here. The Bill does not deal with this matter. While waiting they are not allowed to work, contribute to society or participate in any way. In fact, they are costing us money, which is a shame. They do not want to cost us money. They are here for various reasons but they would prefer to work, earn money and look after themselves and their families. Nobody gains from the current situation which leaves everyone dissatisfied and fuels racism. It is a lose-lose situation across the board but it must be addressed. Our Departments cannot cope with the number of applications, so we know it will take two, three or four years to process them. Therefore, we should issue renewable six-month work permits for the first two years to such people who are here. The work permits will probably not be issued to those in the €30,000 per year category, but to those in lower skilled jobs. However, they want to work so they should be allowed to do so. It is not fair to leave people in Mosney to undertake study courses, living on €20 or €30 per week. They may be looked after but that is not what they want.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I have come across people in my constituency office who are trained in pharmacy and other health areas, yet they are not allowed to work. It is the greatest waste of talent, which is a shame. The Minister's Department together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be able suggest some solutions. This is not rocket science. We know it will take three years to deal with such applications so why not do something for them in the interim?</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The unnecessary delays in the application process are causing confusion. It is difficult to obtain information on work permits, including how to go about getting them and who is entitled to apply. The legislation is changing but people should be informed of these changes. The Minister said he hopes to engage next year in an education policy by disseminating information. When that is done, I hope it will be made clear to everyone, including those applying for work permits, what is going on. It is common knowledge to all of us what is expected of a non-national who wants to work here, including the hassle non-nationals must endure in order to work. We must determine the target groups to whom the information should be addressed. Clarity is required because there is an awful lot of misinformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">We all hear stories of people attending constituency clinics looking for something and the first thing they say is, "If I was a non-national...". That situation needs to end once and for all through providing clear information to everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Minister referred to different pillars, including a €30,000 to €60,000 category, but where did the lower figure come from? When it first came out the figure was €55,000 but I am glad someone had sense and realised that it represented a junior doctor's status. Where did we come up with the idea that one had to earn more than €30,000 a year to be considered as a skilled worker and qualify for a green card? Perhaps there is a logical reason behind it and, if so, I would like to hear it.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The legislation concerns a policy of issuing permits to bring people to work here. We need many such people and thousands of them are already here. The legislation does not refer to integration. It is all about work permits for immigrants but we cannot expect people to come here to work if we do nothing to help them to integrate. Very little is being done in that regard at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I have seen non-nationals in Navan, Kells, Trim and elsewhere in County Meath, and I am sure it is the same in every other county, who come here with or without work permits. They are living in estates and are trying to do their various jobs, but nothing is being done to help them to blend into our society. Consequently, they are not happy and neither are their neighbours. Something must be done to integrate them because it is no good bringing people here to work without a proper integration system that would help to get them involved in society. In that way they would gain more socially rather than merely economically. That responsibility needs to be addressed in the Bill. We must debate how we can achieve that objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Many people come here to work from outside the EU member states but they are unsure of their rights and responsibilities. One clear example can be seen on the roads where people are not used to driving on the left-hand side. This problem must be dealt with in a cross-departmental manner because it involves different Ministers. Many of those coming to live here are not ready to drive on our roads. Quite a number of local people cannot drive properly either, but that is another day's work. Do newly arrived immigrants know the rules of the road and are they receiving training in this regard? That is one example, but there are many other areas in which people coming from abroad need help and guidance. They need to be informed of their responsibilities and educated about our ways both for their own peace of mind and safety. I have seen too many crashes involving non-nationals. They may occur for various reasons but the problem needs to be discussed and sorted out. It cannot continue. I can produce facts showing we need to tackle this area. It is a matter which is slipping through. It is relevant to work permits, immigration etc. It is not being discussed sufficiently and it is not being resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The Bill does not make it clear whether the work permit is issued to the employer or the employee. My reading is that the employee will get it if he or she has the offer of a job, which means it is still in the control of an employer. If the work permit is tied either to the employer or to a job the employee is not in control. An employee who loses a job will no longer have a permit which means that employees will still be fearful of what would happen if they question employers or do something wrong. The legislation does not go far enough as it still ties employees who do not have the scope to move to another job. Perhaps the Minister can clarify the position for me.</p>

Perhaps the 12 month timeframe should be reconsidered as things can go wrong within that time. What would happen if an employee were made redundant after six months?

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I am asking these questions, as this area has not been discussed adequately.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The Bill provides that employees will be told of their rights in their contracts. It also provides that the cost of recruitment cannot be deducted from employees' wages. However, details of the contract of employment are not stated clearly. Many non-nationals are not clearly advised what they will be paid. Some are being given accommodation and cars and a certain amount of money each month — I will formally furnish the Minister with information regarding certain companies that do this. Employees do not know how much they should be paid. Given the other benefits, they may be adequately paid but their wages are not clearly set out. This is not satisfactory as it leaves considerable doubt. Employees are often afraid to ask questions or express concern about being paid properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The Minister stated that there have been 31 labour inspectors since April. They will only deal with cases brought to their attention by way of accusations and much abuse goes unreported. How should we hunt that down? Do we have sufficient inspectors to follow through on those matters and carry out investigations in employers' premises without their being tipped off beforehand? While increasing the number of staff is of considerable help, I am still not sure if the numbers are sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The issue of workers with permits bringing the rest of their family here must be tackled. The system is failing and there is considerable confusion. I have come across many of these cases and no clear criteria are set down stating what an employee on a permit needs to have achieved, be earning or have saved in order that he or she can bring his or her family here. Letters refusing such people permission to bring their families often state they are earning insufficient money. They could be earning €15,000 to €20,000, which is more than the amount on which we expect a family on social welfare to survive. The Department of Social and Family Affairs can expect a family to live on a certain amount and yet other Departments believe this is insufficient to provide for a family. Which Department is wrong? Either the Department of Social and Family Affairs is not giving enough or we are asking too much of non-nationals and discriminating against them. This matter needs to be resolved and the Bill is inadequate in addressing how families should be permitted to come. Reference is made to the higher bracket of €60,000 or more as proof of having sufficient money to provide for a family.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Many people are working here in miserable conditions and spend hours on the phone to home, which is not good enough. While I understand there is a fear that the family would become a burden on the State, we need to reconsider the matter and address it. As many of our family members have spent time working abroad we should know how bad it is and we should go out of our way to set an example and make it better. However, we make it hard. It takes numerous applications to get a spouse or family to come here, which is not good enough. It is unfair to introduce a Bill without addressing such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I look forward to the programme of education to be introduced next year. We have discussed those with work permits transferring between jobs. The issue of transferable skills of those who trained in another country must be addressed. People's skills are often outside the control of the Government. We need to consider the matter and see what can be done so that someone trained abroad can easily do a refresher course to work in this country for an appropriate remuneration. In many cases people are unable to get the job for which they trained owing to specific qualification requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">I touched on the issue of non-national students who need to leave the country to apply for a permit, which is an awful waste. It places a burden on the person who must incur cost in returning to his or her country. The time he or she must wait is lost. These people have been through our college system and we should find a way to eliminate the necessity of them leaving the country to get a work permit. In other countries, for example Canada, students approaching the end of their college days can apply for a permit to stay. They do not need to leave the country and come back and this should apply here.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Many non-nationals on work permits who have been here for four, five or six years have children who want to attend college but who are required to pay substantial student fees. While people from some countries are exempt, people from many other countries are required to pay considerable sums. Such people might have lived here for many years, played a major part in the community and may have applied for citizenship but they must still pay very high college fees. This area needs to be reconsidered. While we seem to be quite happy to have such people contribute to our economy, we still want to charge them to send their children to college. As we encourage students to continue their education to third level, we should make it easier for people who will most likely end up living here permanently. We should apply common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">We should learn from the experiences in other countries. Most people believe the green card system in the United States works well. However, the Americans would also admit they are getting the family reunification system wrong. We have learnt from them and from other countries. We should consider what changes we should introduce. This is one of the major areas that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Some intending migrants before leaving their home country may have heard much about Ireland and how good it is. They are not being given enough information before they leave to allow them to make an informed decision and help them settle in on arrival. Since the mid-1990s the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has advertised to encourage Irish people to return home from places like South Africa and Australia. Many others who were not originally Irish came from those countries too. They heard that Ireland was a great country, with big jobs and lots of money. When they arrived they found how costly it would be to stay. They saw the high cost of living, and what would be expected of them. Accordingly there should be much more pre-departure information about the cost of living here, rental costs, school costs, tax, employment rights and so on. All this should be made clear to people before they come to Ireland. The Government cannot go to different countries to give such information but the agencies organising work permits do not give out clear information. Many people arrive here simply in hope. There is an onus on us to do what we can in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Getting a work permit, and permission from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to stay in Ireland, is a slow and cumbersome business. The Minister liaises with that Department, but it is struggling with the workload and with being a service provider to the public. That was not its job originally, but in the past few years it has had to deal with a great number of applications. That needs to be examined and sorted out with more staff or whatever is necessary. The situation cannot continue whereby one must wait 15 or 16 months to get information and perhaps three or four years for permits other than work permits. This is not fair. One can be told to phone the Department in this regard only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and there might be no reply. That is no way to treat anyone. This matter falls under immigration policy. The system and how it works must be made clearer to the public, as must people's entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The Minister said a group would review immigration policy, outline the list of skilled jobs for which workers are needed and update it regularly. There should be an independent advisory board of some sort to oversee immigration issues and react quickly. This area changes rapidly. It is a cross-departmental responsibility. In Australia for example, the list of skilled workers needed is updated every six months. Hopefully we will get to that stage too.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_374">I thank the Minister for attending this debate. The Minister's predecessor in his post, Deputy Harney, decided with Government that the economic road we would take was one of attracting tens of thousands of immigrants into this country every year. That policy has not been adopted by every country. It was agreed on the basis of permits to employers, which in many instances came to operate like a bonded labour system, with many reports of abuses around the country. In that context I congratulate a number of trade unions, especially SIPTU and its officials, which over the past few years have followed in detail issues of exploitation and ripping-off of foreign workers brought in on contract and treated very badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">How effective will the regulations be with regard to agents, agencies and people who find foreign workers? No matter what we try to do, there will be people in vulnerable situations who will be recruited by local agents, will end up owing them large amounts of money and will in effect be indentured labourers, but based in Ireland rather than in India or Pakistan, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">A report was published earlier this week by the child development initiative in west Tallaght concentrating on four of the poorest estates in that area. I remind the Minister of this in case it is forgotten. The report indicated that the level of unemployment in those four estates is 10%. I hope that in the rush to bring in immigrants we do not lose sight of the people in our communities, whether in west Tallaght, Blanchardstown or the Minister's own city of Cork. Many Irish people are not getting opportunities to participate in the economy. Many young men drop out of school early. Some of them have specific problems, but we have serious problems with regard to our own people participating. Government policy should focus just as much on giving opportunity to Irish people, wherever they live, as on bringing in immigrants, which in some instances is not thought through.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Like every Deputy, I am inundated by people who have come to Ireland to work, make a good contribution to the economy and who give their services. However, when for instance a child is born, a foreign grandparent cannot get a visa to visit. Regarding a green card policy, Bruce Morrison has done a great deal of work for Irish emigrants in America and on numerous occasions he has said that if one accepts a green card system of any kind, one must accept that a large proportion of the people availing of it will come to settle in Ireland, and that their families will come too. That is particularly true with regard to parts of the Indian subcontinent where the policy of marriages arranged by parents remains the cultural norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">This is a difficult problem which the Minister must acknowledge. For example, we have large numbers of people employed at a high level in the computer industry in Ireland who originate from the Indian subcontinent. The issue of members of their families, or indeed husbands and wives, being able to come to Ireland, has not been resolved. I know the Minister's Department is not directly responsible, but this needs to be addressed. Consider, for example, how that situation affects a person who has developed a pharmaceutical company in Ireland. He is a doctor from some other part of the world and his wife is an Irish doctor. I know of one foreign person who won awards for an enterprise he and his partner set up. Happily, they had a child. The man's parents lived in the Indian subcontinent and it took almost two years of going back and forth to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to get a visitor's visa for the grandparents. The grandparents were people of significant means and there were no indications that they were going to come to Ireland and live off the Exchequer. These issues must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Another issue arises more in the context of the next debate, namely coherence. Ireland has a significant development policy which we are continuing to expand and hopefully one day we will live up to the commitment of 0.7% of GNP promised in overseas aid. However, where is the coherence with regard to poaching from Third World countries some of the most highly qualified doctors, nurses and other professionals? If we take so many of those qualified staff from countries like the Philippines, South Africa and other countries with huge needs, what do we give them back? Is there a way of giving people a good opportunity to be in Ireland for a period of time, earning money and getting experience, but of also ensuring that if possible, their expertise, which is desperately needed in their own countries, particularly in rural areas of the developing world, is returned? In some ways this is an exchange. People are educated to a high level and are then poached by Ireland. Health services in many developing countries are thus left bereft of these badly needed professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I ask for a coherent statement from the Minister about the Government's drive with regard to immigration, its implications for us as a society, and the implications of poaching staff from developing countries where they are badly needed. In conjunction with his colleague in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, would the Minister consider conducting a review of asylum seekers and compiling a register of skills, particularly of those with children who have been here for a long time, to see if some of them could fit into this category and be given the right to work and contribute to the economy?</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_381">I welcome the opportunity to make a statement to the Dáil on this matter. We have all been shocked and saddened at the destruction wreaked by the natural disaster which hit northern Pakistan and the surrounding areas on Saturday. The earthquake measured approximately 7.6 on the Richter scale. Aftershocks were as high as 5.9 in the immediate aftermath and they continue still on a lesser scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The result has been widespread devastation of towns and villages. Families and communities have been devastated. The death toll is now estimated to be in excess of 20,000 people. The final figure will be higher. Non-fatal casualties will be many times that figure. Many of the fatalities are children. Gathered together in schools, as their parents worked in the fields or workplaces, they were particularly vulnerable when the earthquake struck. The depth of grief for those who survived is incalculable. We share in their sadness. We join the international community in mourning that loss of precious human life.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The President and the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, conveyed the sympathies of the people of Ireland to their counterparts in Pakistan and India in the aftermath of this terrible disaster. I also extend my sympathies to the Pakistani community in Ireland which has been affected by this tragedy. We are fortunate to have such a vibrant Pakistani-Irish community in our country and I acknowledge its great contribution in assisting with relief efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">In appalling weather conditions, the immediate need is to bring relief and aid in order that further fatalities are minimised. Ireland has offered not just sympathy. Our allocation of €3 million is but an initial response to the needs of a people in the midst of an appalling human tragedy. In line with our previous timely response to both the tsunami and the food shortages in Niger earlier this year, our emergency response will be followed by a second phase response aimed at helping the region and its people towards recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">As Minister of State with responsibility for Irish aid, I have closely followed the situation since the earthquake on Saturday. I remained in contact over the following hours and days with my senior officials, the Taoiseach, colleagues in the Government and with key individuals such as the ambassador of Pakistan, His Excellency Mr. Toheed Ahmad, and representatives of the Pakistani community in Ireland. I convened a meeting of Irish NGO representatives to discuss the situation, hear their views and brief them on our response. Officials from my Department and in missions abroad are in close contact with UN agencies and the International Federation of the Red Cross regarding emerging needs and situation reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake I made an initial pledge of €1 million to assist with immediate relief efforts in the region. That cash response was announced the day after the earthquake. When, on Monday, I met the ambassador of Pakistan to Ireland he gave me an update of the situation on the ground and outlined the emerging needs identified by the government of Pakistan for food, shelter and medical items. The region faces enormous logistical difficulties. Roads that had been cleared were cut off again by landslide and torrential rains. Relief supplies to Muzaffarabad, one of the most affected areas, could only be undertaken using scarce and limited air resources, mainly helicopters.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">At the meeting on Monday with representatives of non-governmental organisations involved in the relief effort, I obtained an indication of their preliminary requirements. I briefed them on the decision to make an additional €2 million available for relief efforts in Pakistan and the surrounding region. I also briefed and heard the views of a representative of the Pakistani community, Dr. Mazhar Bari, who, as it happens, is a good friend.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">This brings to €3 million the amount made available for the region in the aftermath of the earthquake. The initial need is for food, shelter and other basic non-food requirements. The Government is supporting the UN effort with €1.2 million. The Government is also allocating €l million of this funding to UNICEF which has mobilised quickly and released its pre-stocked relief supplies of blankets, children's clothing, plastic sheeting, water purifications tablets and high protein biscuits. UNICEF has operated in Pakistan since 1947 and has staff and supplies in the country. UNICEF convoys are en route with other essential supplies.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Specific funding has also been allocated to the World Health Organisation, WHO, which is supporting the Pakistani Ministry of Health and local health authorities in co-ordinating the health component of the response, including relief supplies and human resources, and supporting the establishment of public health initiatives, including an early warning communicable disease surveillance. We have also provided funding for the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA. OCHA is taking the lead on supporting the government of Pakistan's relief efforts and the response of UN partners and agencies. In particular, it is mobilising and co-ordinating assessment, planning, implementation and monitoring of assistance which is crucial for the provision of timely and effective aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Government has allocated €300,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross. The Red Cross and Red Crescent family of organisations, which is very experienced and is present in the area through its local networks, is on the ground. Our funding will support its work in the area. In the meetings with Ambassador Ahmad and the NGOs, and in my public statements, I made clear that we were conscious of the need to assist the recovery process. The recovery needs of the region will obviously be enormous given the scale of the destruction and the challenge of working in such difficult terrain. The Government is committed to assisting local communities in the recovery effort, through our donor and humanitarian partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Ireland has earned a very strong international reputation for responding generously to emergency and humanitarian crises globally. The provision of timely, significant and flexible funding represents good humanitarian donorship and is in line with best practice internationally. It is a tangible and manifest example of how the public's money is spent to relieve extreme human suffering through humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian assistance will continue to feature strongly in the context of expanding budgetary resources in the area of development co-operation. Irish Aid plans to be a leader in this area and to leverage best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">We are fortunate in having non-governmental organisations, NGOs, active on the ground. Discussions have taken place with a number of the Irish NGOs working directly or through partners in the affected region. I understand that already, through the sterling work of our own Irish NGOs, money has been raised from the public. I am conscious of the strong contribution the Pakistani community and the wider Muslim community has made in Ireland and now call on the Irish public to be generous in their response. I give my own voice and that of the Government to these fund raising appeals. I have made funding of up to €1.5 million available in support of the efforts of the Irish based NGOs in terms of their intervention on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Funding to develop NGO capacity has also been made available through the multi-annual programme scheme which offers predictable funding over a period of years around which the NGOs can plan their efforts. These types of funding have helped them to respond to major humanitarian emergencies in a more effective and timely manner. We will continue to monitor the ongoing situation closely, with the assistance of UN agencies and partner organisations, to ensure that our assistance can be effectively targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I will now turn to another humanitarian emergency unfolding in Central America. Severe flooding made worse by remnants of Hurricane Stan has and continues to deluge vast areas of Central America, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Families continue to flee what is left of their homes and entire villages have been swept away by swollen rivers and mudslides.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The official death toll from the floods ravaging Central America and Mexico surged in recent days as hundreds more were feared dead in Guatemala following last week's mudslide that swallowed two small towns in the west of the country. In addition, 72 people were listed dead in El Salvador, 28 in Mexico and 11 in Nicaragua. The death toll is likely to double as about 1,400 people were believed to have been buried alive by a mudslide that hit Guatemalan towns, just over 100 miles west of the Guatemalan capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Federation of the Red Cross have launched appeals on behalf of the agencies that are actively supplying disaster and emergency aid in the region. Ireland is in contact with the UN, the International Red Cross and Irish NGOs working directly or through partners to establish the most appropriate response at this point. In response to this emergency I have allocated funding of €1 million for humanitarian assistance, which will be dispersed among the Red Cross, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and non-governmental organisations providing services on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">In 2005 Ireland has already made separate contributions of over €9.5 million to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and €3 million to UNICEF for its global operations. These funds have been deliberately not earmarked to ensure they can be utilised quickly and effectively for emergency and humanitarian planning and rapid responses by these key UN agencies. This contribution from Ireland is in line with international best practice. UN agencies will demand and require more of this form of aid in the future whereby money is donated at an earlier stage. Every dollar available for pre-emptive or early intervention saves €7 in the cost of emergency response. Over €2 million was released to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA, to facilitate that agency to plan for prioritised humanitarian emergencies. Ireland's early funding provides much needed cash flow for these agencies at a time when they need it most.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The overall budget for humanitarian assistance is deliberately designed to be flexible in response to disasters of this kind wherever they occur. In the context of increased funding, the Government is reviewing all practices and procedures to ensure quality programming, including the provision of humanitarian relief and rapid response.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Ireland will respond as generously and effectively as possible to the humanitarian needs of the people of northern Pakistan and the surrounding regions as the situation unfolds by funding those agencies and NGOs optimally placed to deliver the wide range of basic needs and services which will be essential to protect the most vulnerable. A significant increase in resources for overseas aid is being planned for the period up to 2012. The Government will review and expand its early preparedness for these situations. The level of funding for emergency and recovery functions will be increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Some leading NGOs such as Trócaire, GOAL and Concern play a significant role in emergency response and the expanded programme will enhance and deepen the level of co-operation with those agencies. They do fantastic work in far-flung places and become involved in very difficult and dangerous situations such as earthquakes, famine, flood and incidences of civil disorder. The work of these agencies is strongly endorsed by the Government and the official Irish aid programme and the Government is anxious to enhance that co-operation. We will resume contact with our Pakistani friends at embassy and international level to maximise Ireland's contribution to the recovery phase in which people try to rebuild their lives and homes, return to work and school and normal life recommences where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I thank all the party Whips who have provided me with the opportunity to outline the Government's response and its continuing interest.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_229">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_402">Like the Minister of State, I extend the sympathy and support of the Fine Gael Party to the people who have been affected in Pakistan and the general area of Kashmir and surrounding areas. The televised images of this disaster brings home its impact on the support services, which are miniature in scale when compared with the magnitude of the disaster. Four major disasters have occurred in the past ten months, the tsunami, the New Orleans hurricane, the Asian earthquake and the flooding in Central America. I acknowledge the great work done by the voluntary bodies such as the NGOs and aid agencies which have become major players.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The areas where disasters have struck seem to be lacking in supplies of heavy lifting gear which are essential for the early restoration of essential services such as roads and bridges and the removal of collapsed buildings under which people are trapped and may still be alive. The breakdown in the communications network and the road and rail network must be addressed at the earliest possible opportunity but the international community has not yet been able to make an effective input. The rapid response unit proposed by the EU could co-operate with bodies such as the United Nations as they are all involved in the same business. The difficulty seems to be in the ability to move the necessary machinery to where it is needed and without delay. This may not always be possible within 24 hours but it should be in place within two or three days or a week later. The greater the delay, the more difficult the logistics become and the greater the risk of a breakdown in law and order.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Natural disasters on a large scale require a timely response and support for aid agencies and voluntary groups such as the International Red Cross at an early stage is crucial. The criticisms of the local response in Pakistan are unfair. Infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications must be repaired so aid can be supplied. Given the frequency of these natural disasters, more co-ordination and speed must be introduced into any response.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">I congratulate the Government for its efforts. It is expected of a country at this stage of development that it should be able to respond in that fashion. I hope the UN baseline figure for aid of 0.7% of GDP as envisaged in the second UN declaration will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The responsibility remains with the developed world to respond as best and speedily as it can. Different situations have differing needs but the most immediate are housing shelter, drinking water, food and clothing. The agencies have the ability to deliver in those circumstances but co-ordination is required. Moral support is not sufficient as aid when people on the ground are waiting for a delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Weather conditions have been a serious problem in this most recent disaster. The weather became atrocious at the time of the earthquake, which was unfortunate but one of those things that can happen. With a natural disaster, there is no way of planning for the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">An early evaluation of the situation in a disaster area is essential. It is not always possible to do this, because evaluators may be travelling from the far corners of the world and the logistics of getting into certain areas can be very difficult. However, the earlier an assessment can be made, the better for all concerned. Assessments should also be as indepth as possible, to benefit those affected. For example, a week after the New Orleans disaster, people where still speculating as to what needed to be done. This happened in the most powerful country in the world, where the logistics, heavy lifting equipment and necessary gear were readily available. The problem in New Orleans was a failure to identify the full extent of the problem as early as possible and to take the necessary action. People were tripping over one another in their efforts to help, but there was no proper co-ordination of the relief effort. That is the lesson to be learned from that particular disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">We should learn from each and every disaster that occurs to improve the manner in which we respond. Unfortunately, there will be more disasters such as the ones we are now discussing. Global warming may be a factor but we cannot blame it for the recent earthquake. For whatever reason, it seems natural disasters are happening more frequently and in that context, we should learn from each one and put our experience to good use in terms of our response.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">To reiterate, an initial assessment in any disaster situation is essential. A rapid assessment which gathers as much information as possible and identifies the needs of the people who are still alive must take place at an earlier stage than has been the case to date. Co-ordination of the way in which help is delivered is vital and relief efforts are more effective when co-operation from the authorities in the countries concerned is secured. The items that are most essential should be identified as early as possible, whether they be household items, shelter, food, water and so on. The order of priority will not necessarily be the same in every disaster situation. The items need to be assessed, identified and the means found to deliver them to the affected areas in the shortest possible time. If we do that, in the first instance, we will address the problems of the people who are directly affected in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I extend my sympathies to the affected people in Asia and Central America. The Irish people have always risen to situations such as these and responded generously. I have no doubt they will do so now and again in the future. I hope the lessons we have learned from the past will be put to good use and will improve the way we deliver aid, if and when required.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_230">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_412">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the current position in Pakistan and the tragedies unfolding in Central America. I join others who have offered their sympathy to the President and people of Pakistan and to the ambassador here. I also warmly welcome the indications of assistance from the Government so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">What has struck everybody is the vulnerability, in particular, of remote villages which cannot be accessed easily following an earthquake of this scale. It raises the issue of the urgency that attaches to the establishment of a disaster prediction agency and of such an agency being available in more than one location. This issue came to the fore immediately after the tsunami and the view of the experts, within the United Nations and elsewhere, is that we need the capacity to make a regional response. It is urgent that we make progress on this. It is also important that we accept, given the disposal of the populations at risk, often with only single road access, that air transport is required in the immediate aftermath if we are to respond to disasters quickly. This points to the necessity of having a rapid reaction force to handle disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">This disaster provides an opportunity to respond generously and in a concerned way. It was very moving to hear of the manner in which people from the different communities of Kashmir, India and Pakistan living abroad shared in their concern for people at home. I offer my sympathy on behalf of the Labour Party and of most of the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">It is important that we are able to respond and can put aside any sense of weariness. I welcome the Government's pledge of €3 million for Pakistan and its disposal of that money. I make the case, however, that we need to look at the medium-term situation and at what must be achieved through the international agencies, particularly the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I am much more familiar with the region of Central America. The areas that have been affected by Hurricane Stan include Guatemala, El Salvador, southern Mexico and Nicaragua. I have visited Central America many times. It would be a great pity if, because of the general problem of aid weariness and the fact that this region is not being covered by the international media, this disaster was driven out by images from another part of the world. It would be appalling and morally unacceptable if we had to choose between disasters to which to respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">This has happened before — Hurricane Mitch struck the region in 1998. The last disaster in Central America, involving El Salvador, among other countries, was in 2001, when mudslides wiped out entire villages, which is happening again. There is a need to deal with the preventative issues such as deforestation, the capacity to provide low cost housing and the capacity to replace agricultural tools and seeds that have been lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">We are very fortunate that Trócaire has an office in Honduras, headed by Sally O'Neill Sanchez. It also has offices in Guatemala and El Salvador. It has already allocated a considerable amount of money, approximately €70,000, from its own resources to the disaster relief but this is but a drop in the ocean in terms of what is required. I urge the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to assess the allocation to Central America and take into account the capacity that is already there. There are offices there with experience stretching back to the 1980s. They dealt with Hurricane Mitch and the natural disaster of 2001. Money given to those offices would be spent very effectively and very much welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The estimated death toll in Guatemala is officially 652. However, aid workers on the ground have pointed out that they cannot account for many people who are missing. A final figure is difficult to arrive at because entire villages have been wiped out. Ms O'Neill Sanchez has reported that some of the villages constitute mass graves as they have simply been covered by mudslides. Some 790 deaths have been recorded in El Salvador, with more than 60,600 people remaining in shelters.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I am aware from previous responses to natural disasters in Central America that if the television cameras cannot get there quickly, it is assumed that the events did not take place, which is disastrous because these are poor people. If one examines the United Nations development report, one will find that these countries are in the bottom category on the human development index. There is very little local capacity in these areas. Guatemala, where people are suffering, is interesting. Of the seven Central American states, statistically it has an Indian majority of approximately 51% or 52%. We should be concerned about this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The Minister of State is correct to stress the importance of the contribution of non-governmental organisations in Pakistan and the surrounding region, and also in Central America. Irish NGOs are working directly in Pakistan as well as through partner organisations. These organisations deserve our support. I join the Minister of State and other spokespersons in thanking them for their efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The immediate requirements in Central America, with which I am more familiar, is housing and shelter. It will also be necessary to reactivate agricultural and livestock production as people who miss out on a whole season will need assistance in this area. It is urgent that mechanisms be put in place for the restoration of clean drinking water. Like the Pakistan situation, albeit to a minor degree, there will be difficulties, particularly in mountainous areas, in trying to restore a minimal road access network.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I appeal to the Minister of State to assist Trócaire in dealing with the disaster in Central America where €70,000 has been allocated across 19 organisations. This amount of money will only go so far towards providing food, medicines, water, bedding and shelter materials, including personal hygiene items. I am sure the Minister of State will be sympathetic to my appeal for assistance in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I congratulate the Irish Government for responding quickly on this occasion and for indicating that it will respond further when the need arises. Given the level of public support and the experience of different Governments working abroad, this country should endeavour to develop an expertise whereby it can play a leading role in developing the capacity for prediction, which is scientific, shared on a regional basis, and for a rapid response to reconstruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Central America is a hurricane region. No one should be surprised to hear of hurricanes happening in this part of the world. We are all aware of the response that was necessary when hurricane Mitch took place and there was a further disaster in 2001. In 2005, we should have been able to anticipate the needs as they arose and respond effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I look forward to the Minister of State's response. I decided to emphasise the Central American situation, because it is the area with which I am most familiar, and I was anxious that it should not get lost entirely in the debate. I will conclude by saying that the level of deaths in Pakistan, Kashmir and the wider region, which will exceed 40,000, strikes all of us as a great humanitarian disaster. It is encouraging that people in Ireland have been able to respond to it and those who respond by way of a generous allocation will have the support of this side of the House.</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_427">I wish to share my time with Deputy Finian McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The sheer scale of the disaster in terms of the numbers of people affected in the Kashmir-Pakistan region is breathtaking and very difficult to take in. We must understand how exceptional it is in terms of our response. While there is a limit to what can be done in the days and weeks ahead, we cannot lose sight of the fact that there is need for an ongoing contribution to help people to rebuild their lives. While the region is politically volatile, I share the views of other Members on the unity displayed in the region, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I listened carefully to what Deputy Higgins said about Central America and I recognise that this is part of what is being debated today. People understand that there must be a second response by way of putting people's lives back together, in which charitable donations play an important role. However, when the television coverage ends, these donations can dry up, which is where the Government's response must come in.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">There is a third and important response, namely, learning from these disasters. Science indicates that this area is on an earthquake fault line where these disasters will recur. Therefore, it is important to predict and plan for these disasters. For example, in Japan, there is a very good model whereby people who live in these geographical locations are informed where to go to be safe and materials that may be helpful are identified. It is dreadful to witness people trying to remove rubble with their bare hands which may be covering human beings who are still alive underneath. Very often the rescue effort takes far too long to put into operation. We must influence how policy develops in terms of predicting and responding to disasters so that we can try to minimise the number of lives lost, particularly in the case of earthquakes.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_431">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the earthquakes on this sad day. I wish to begin by expressing my sympathy to the people of Pakistan, Kashmir and Guatemala. These earthquakes and mudslides were a nightmare experience for many of these people. It is important to indicate our cross-party sympathy, solidarity and support for the people concerned. I am pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, is present for the debate because it is important to get out there and assist the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">It is time in this debate for support, solidarity, compassion and action to help the people involved. I urge the world, through the United Nations and the EU, including Asia and South America, to unite over the next 24 hours to aid the countries in question. We are talking about people on the front line, not nationalities. The earthquake in Pakistan is estimated to have killed 50,000 people with 23,000 bodies recovered so far. Approximately 2.5 million need shelter. A total of 11,000 died in Muzaffarabad, Kashmir, which was the worst hit city. The earthquake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale and there were 22 aftershocks. It is essential there is no hesitation in coming to the aid of people in the region. The saddest incident reported following this disaster involved 250 girls who were crushed to death in the rubble of their primary school. I worked as a teacher for 20 years and this is a nightmare for the families and the teachers affected. The earthquake triggered landslides and flattened apartment buildings, killing 2,000 people in one incident. Buildings shook and walls swayed for almost a minute in the capitals of Afghanistan, Indian and Pakistan and panicked people ran from their homes and offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">There was one positive incident during the earthquake as Indian soldiers left their position to assist their Pakistani counterparts. It is sad they are in bunkers pointing guns at each other. Many countries must come out of their bunkers. I express my support for and solidarity with Fr. Alec Reid, who instigated the peace process in Northern Ireland. He successfully urged people to come out of their bunkers. I support him, particularly as many people have attacked him in the past 12 hours. Reference to bunkers and respecting different nationalities is relevant in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The role of the UN and rich developed countries is important. I am always amazed how powers such as the US and Britain invade countries in a matter of hours, erect tents and set up field hospitals, yet when a catastrophe occurs, a bureaucratic problem delays the provision of aid. Why when people are starving in the world, does the international community not come to their aid?</p>
          <p eId="para_435">In Guatemala 1,400 Mayan Indians were killed in a horrific landslide triggered by Hurricane Stan. It was absolutely appalling and I urge western powers to provide assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The Government has received much criticism for not meeting its target of 0.7% of GNP for the overseas development aid budget. I am a critic but I challenge the media to devote 0.7% of their coverage to development issues in order that people understand the true picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I commend members of the public for their magnificent donations to voluntary organisations in the past 12 months. Trócaire received €56 million in 2004, an increase of €30 million on the previous financial year. Much of the money was donated following the Asia tsunami appeal, which generated €26.5 million. The public wants to help and I call on the Minister of State and the Government to back the public and end the war on poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">On behalf of Independent Members, I offer my sympathy and support to the people of Pakistan, Kashmir and Guatemala.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_439">On behalf of the Green Party, I offer my deepest sympathy to the people of Pakistan, Kashmir and Guatemala and the surrounding areas. The severe flooding in Central America has been overlooked. A deluge has been experienced in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua and army helicopters and aid trucks are ferrying food to villages in the Guatemala highlands, which remain isolated. Natural disasters will happen but there is a link between the recent hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina, and climate change. Something must be done about this problem soon. The Government's response to the Kyoto Protocol has been irresponsible. We are part of the global community but the people affected by the recent disasters have not contributed substantially to the problem of climate change and global warming. Western countries, in particular the US, are contributing to the problem. The death toll following Hurricane Katrina is estimated at 14,000, although I have read other estimates of between 2,000 and 4,000. We are faced with this difficulty in both the US and Pakistan.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Many children were affected by the earthquake in Pakistan. Those of us who are parents find that the most traumatic element of such disasters. Pakistan ranks 135th of 177 countries on the UN human development list, yet one of the first news stories to emerge following the earthquake was that the nuclear installations and weapons were fine. It is obscene that so much is spent on weapons of mass destruction but not enough money is available to deal with serious natural disasters. While the Government has donated money, is this allocation in addition to the original development aid budget for 2005? How much is being donated?</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_443">On behalf of all members of Sinn Féin, I express our deepest condolences over the tragic loss of up to 40,000 lives in the earthquake last Saturday that hit Pakistan, India and Afghanistan. Our thoughts are with all the bereaved families, the orphaned children and the traumatised survivors, many of whom have been made homeless and jobless and must rebuild their lives. Our thoughts are also with the adults and children who are more vulnerable than ever to preventable death from hunger or disease and the Pakistani, Indian and Afghanistan citizens, leaders, public servants and NGOs who are coping with a large scale disaster. The bravery and community spirit demonstrated by ordinary citizens in these devastated communities humbles all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Sinn Féin extends its solidarity to all of them, our brothers and sisters, as they face the daunting task of preventing a second wave of disease-related deaths, in particular, as torrential rain and winds continue to obstruct and hamper relief efforts. Médecins Sans Frontières has warned of the threat posed by water-borne diseases in Muzaffarabad, in particular, where people are surviving in cramped conditions, with some forced to spend nights without shelter, food or medical care in harsh and freezing weather conditions. We also extend our solidarity to those preparing for the monumentally difficult task of reconstruction in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I welcome the Government's pledge of €3 million to assist relief efforts in Pakistan, India and Afghanistan. The UN appealed for $272 million in aid. It is estimated that about 2.5 million people are now in need of the basics of life such as shelter, medical care, food and water. As the second wealthiest country in the world, I invite the Government to commit additional resources, including further financial resources, to assist the relief efforts in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">On behalf of the Sinn Féin Party, I express our deepest condolences over the tragic loss of at least 1,000 lives as a result of the mudslides caused by the tropical storm Stan last week in Guatemala. We are also deeply concerned for all the people affected by the severe flooding in other parts of Central America, including El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. Our thoughts are with the bereaved families especially those who still wait in uncertainty and all who have been left homeless by the mudslides and floods. We recognise with admiration the great work of the local people, NGOs and state agencies who have been engaged in the harrowing task of attempting to recover bodies and to care for those survivors who managed to flee their homes in time. Sinn Féin extends its solidarity to the people of Central America in this time of great distress and need.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I welcome the Government's second pledge of €1 million to assist relief efforts in Central America. I invite the Government to make available to the region as many resources, including financial and practical, as possible. Sinn Féin welcomed the commitment included in the United Nations 2005 World Summit Outcome to "supporting the efforts of countries, in particular developing countries, to strengthen their capacities at all levels in order to prepare for and respond rapidly to natural disasters and mitigate their impact". I urge the Government to respond positively and in a timely manner to all and any requests made of it by the United Nations as it participates in the response to the disasters in Asia and Central America, respectively.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_448">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I offer my deepest sympathy to those affected in Pakistan and Guatemala. I compliment my constituency colleague, the Minister the State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on his work and initiative. I am a strong supporter of his efforts and have had a long-term interest in the issue of development aid with regard to disasters and more generally. I have a close friendship with Mr. Chris Flood, who I succeeded in the Dáil, and who has done considerable work in this area. He was of great assistance to the Minister of State and the Department of Foreign Affairs in respect of the tsunami disaster when he became the Irish envoy and he has made an ongoing contribution to the debate on development aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Some colleagues have made points bordering on party political and I am not sure it should be that type of debate. It is important we express solidarity in Parliament and I compliment those who have arranged this debate. Reference has been made to the Pakistani community in Ireland and Dublin. Many Pakistani families reside in my constituency, particularly in the Tallaght area. I have spoken to some of them in my local parish. In my local school, St. Mark's, there is an international community and a considerable percentage of schoolchildren are from different countries, including Pakistan. They have been upset by events in their country, particularly in respect of deaths of children. Pictures and reports from Pakistan were particularly moving. A report on RTE's "Morning Ireland" programme could not have failed to move people as it presented the situation in a graphic way.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">When news of these disasters emerged, I was on a parliamentary trip to Ukraine. As other colleagues have pointed out, Ireland is now proud to be a serious member of the international community. We must play a role in this regard and must take a lead in response to disasters. I am glad the Government has been particularly responsive.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was in my local area, Tallaght, on Monday afternoon. He took the opportunity to brief journalists on what the Government was doing. I was struck by his demeanour as he represented the concerns felt by all. Others have called for an increase in the money earmarked for aid, €3 million for Pakistan and €1 million for America. I am confident the Department will respond as it did to the Asian tsunami, the Government will not be found wanting and we will take our role in the international community seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I was impressed by many points made by the Minister of State. I share his shock and sadness and have already made contact with members of the Pakistani community in the Tallaght area. They appreciate the response of local people and as churchgoers focus on subjects of prayer this weekend the people of Pakistan and the South American states will be on our minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I hope something positive can emerge from this tragedy. I visited a school last week to speak on road safety and one child made a profound comment, she said road safety was not just a matter for today nor for this week. This is a theme we should remember. Disasters such as mudslides and earthquakes bring these matters to world attention and to people's psyches. I am glad there has been a correction of media coverage of the disasters, as it appeared to have slipped off television screens after a few days. I searched for text on this for a few days and it seems we take tragedy for granted. The same logic applies to killings in Iraq and this is wrong. We should be concerned about loss of lives and devastation of communities. The international media must understand this is worthy of our attention. In recent days news bulletins and news agencies have refocused on the disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">When one watches the television and sees the way children are suffering it is important to see a political response to the disaster. I urge the Minister of State to convey these sentiments to the ambassador and I am pleased to see the apology from the President of Pakistan for the lack of response. Such apologies are important as people are the priority and their needs must be met, especially when they are dying. The total number of dead and people affected will be significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">It struck me during the week that in this 21st century, when we can use our phones to send text messages across the world, communication in a region in Pakistan remains so difficult. I am sure the position is the same in Guatemala. I realise there are political and boundary issues relating to different countries but people cannot get the information and it appears it may be some time before we know how many people died in some of those areas. That is something that should affect us and I hope the Government, through the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will continue to convey that message. As ever, the Irish people will be responsive to the need following this tragedy. The Government is showing a clear lead in that regard and I hope the various aid agencies will take advantage of the generosity of the Irish people, who are represented in communities throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate and support the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, in what he is attempting to do. As I said, it is important that we not only join the international community in mourning the huge loss of life in these regions but also play our part as a serious member of the international community. I hope all of us will be brave enough to admit we will close our eyes in the next few days and pray for the people concerned and the relief effort.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_457">I would not say I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this issue but I am pleased to be in the House to do so. It has been a tragic 12 months in terms of natural disasters. We have had hurricanes, floods, tidal waves, earthquakes, mudslides, bush and forest fires and famine due to drought. One disaster appears to follow the next. The tsunami of less than 12 months ago seems like years ago because it has been overtaken in our newspapers and on our television screens by equally horrific tragedies, one after the other. We must begin to ask ourselves, as an international wealthy community in the West, what we are doing to prepare for what we know will be the next tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">On 8 October a powerful earthquake, 7.6 on the Richter scale, struck north-east Islamabad, Pakistani Kashmir, near the Indian border, followed by a series of aftershocks. The earthquake centred on the Kashmir border between India and Pakistan, although the tremor was felt as far away as Kabul and New Delhi. The worst affected regions appear to be in and around the town of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan administered Kashmir, close to the line of control with India. The town itself is extremely badly damaged and some of the surrounding villages have been flattened, as the Minister of State outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The earthquake has probably killed more than 30,000 people but it is difficult to estimate, even within 5,000 or 10,000, the numbers who have died. It appears that up to 60,000 people have been injured, 1 million people have been left in acute need of life saving assistance, 2.5 million people are homeless and 4 million people have been affected. Many access routes to the region have been blocked by mudslides and earthquakes, making it difficult to get relief teams into the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">So far, the response has been substantial but it has not been enough because people continue to die. On 11 October, the United Nations launched a $272 million flash appeal for the south Asia earthquake. The appeal covers life saving and early recovery activities for a six-month emergency phase in the remote region which faces enormous logistical difficulties because landslides have cut off many of the roads, access to many areas is only possible by helicopter and more than 80% of the buildings have been destroyed. The people need shelter, nutrition, medicines, first aid and transport to carry all that. Heavy rain has made much of the area uninhabitable and mudslides make access even more difficult than it was previously. General access to the area is incredibly difficult. Only one small road is open for light vehicles, which means the people are almost entirely dependent on helicopters to carry in the materials needed for up to 2.5 million homeless people in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">UN agencies are already in the area and it is up to the UN to lead in this effort. The UNHCR has begun distributing basic relief supplies for up to 100,000 people using the existing stockpiles throughout the region, including tents, blankets and stoves. The UN world food programme is initially airlifting 200 metric tonnes of high energy biscuits, sufficient for almost 250,000 people, which is vital in the first few days following a disaster when there are no means to cook food. The UN population fund has begun trucking in medical supplies, warning that tens of thousands of people in the area are pregnant and in need of nutrition, medicines and antenatal care for the safe delivery of babies. Many other UN agencies are already at work in the area, including the World Health Organisation and the UN children's fund, UNICEF.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I have concentrated on the UN's response because no one country, certainly not one the size of Ireland, can make a significant impact on its own. So far, the Government's response financially has been fairly good compared with other countries internationally. Ireland and the Irish people are generous when it comes to supporting non-governmental organisations, and the Government is also reasonably generous when it comes to putting funds in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I want to reinforce the point made by Deputy Michael D. Higgins about the Irish Government working through the UN because that is the appropriate point of contact, and we have now a so-called UN ambassador, the Minister for Finance, who is involved in the UN reform process. One of the areas the UN must focus on, given what has happened in the past 12 months, is a more efficient crisis response in the areas we can predict will experience problems. We can predict that there will be mudslides and floods in central America again next year. We can predict that there will be hurricane damage in the Caribbean again next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">We are not talking about creating a crisis force based in Europe or America that can be sent off to regions of the world that need its assistance. It is about building up home-grown capacity in different countries, which is a less sexy but much more efficient and effective way of giving aid. In areas where we know there is likely to be earthquake activity, we should build up supplies, financed by the UN if the countries cannot afford to do it themselves, to ensure the response can get to the areas quickly rather than try to impress the world by sending off planes from the West or by having former American Presidents filmed on site. The UN must give leadership and build capacity in areas of the world that do not have it currently. That is the practical way we can respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I am glad to say that our Department of Foreign Affairs has real credibility on human rights and development aid issues within the UN. I know that from people who work in the UN. We also have similar credibility within the European Union where we could be examining the question of communal responses to crises. After the tsunami last year it took the European Union two weeks to issue a coherent press statement outlining its response, only for the British Foreign Minister to contradict that statement. Let us start building capacity and use our influence as a small cog in a big wheel to bring about change within the European Union and within the United Nations. We should build Ireland's reputation for speaking out on human rights and development aid issues because people listen to us in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The media dictates our response to natural disasters. The more dramatic the incident looks the bigger the impact for four or five days and the need for a political response. Instead of looking for the PR in these responses we should look for planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">President Musharraf said his government did not have anything like the capacity to deal with such an event, although it was predicted. This is where the United Nations needs to offer leadership and where it has lost credibility over a range of areas in the past two or three years. There is an opportunity now to build UN credibility for offering leadership in desperate situations such as the earthquake, where schools have been swallowed by the earth and populations on the scale of Clonmel have been wiped out, and where the military, medical or organisational capacities do not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Unfortunately, most of these tragedies happen in poor parts of the world, which are hopelessly disorganised and ill-prepared to deal with such events. New Orleans is an exception to this but it was not ready.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Given their wealth, Europe and the United States particularly can play a vital non-political role through the United Nations by increasing capacity in the poorest parts of the world where there is strong evidence to suggest there will be more problems. We already do that in regard to early warning systems for tsunamis or tidal waves to gain a few extra hours' notice. Do we also stockpile food, blankets, tents and medical care and have teams of experts who can travel from the developed world to the developing world at a moment's notice?</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Last year I went as a representative of the foreign affairs committee in the European Parliament to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. We met Louise Arbour, the new High Commissioner for Human Rights, who told us that when there is a slaughter in a place such as Darfur she does not have the finance to give the go-ahead to send an inspection team. It normally takes two weeks before she can do so. That comment reminded me how poorly organised and structured some parts of the United Nations are in respect of immediate responses, and how bad the planning is to deal with humanitarian or natural disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Ireland can do only so much in these cases. We can give money but that can make only a small impact. We can, however, have a large impact and gain an international reputation as a country that is consistent and insistent in trying to bring about UN reform. We can forget about the Security Council because what Ireland says there will not make a great difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">We should concentrate on areas where we have influence and credibility such as human rights and development aid, to build a capacity in the United Nations for an immediate crisis response to horrific situations of which we have seen many examples in the past 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I have not spoken about the mudslides in Central America but I appeal to the Minister of State and his Department to ensure they are not forgotten because of the enormity of the earthquake in Pakistan.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_239">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_474">I join my colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, and the Labour Party in offering condolences to the families and others who have been bereaved in Pakistan and in India, and to those who have endured dreadful suffering and loss in Central America. I concur with both Deputy Coveney and Deputy Michael Higgins in regard to preparation for and prediction of disasters and the development of a rapid reaction capacity at regional and national levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The only groups of people who can deal with the aftermath of a disaster such as that in Pakistan are the army, fire brigade, ambulance services, and people who are trained to take orders, not to compete with other agencies but to go in and do the job. Pakistan has a significant army and spends a fair percentage of its national budget on defence and military hardware. If a country is disaster prone or is in a disaster prone region, and requires a large defence budget, it should be possible to develop a protocol whereby a percentage of its defence expenditure is devoted to a capacity to react and cope with disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I concur with Deputy Coveney's point about the PR image of disasters. Much of the media engage in a type of disaster pornography, for want of a better word. It wants pictures of people at their most desperate and destitute. While the intention behind images such as those from Darfur and Niger, and the few from Pakistan, may help to raise funding and alert people's compassion, we must guard against transferring them to the whole of the country. This gives the impression that people from whole continents or regions have no capacity and feeds into a theory, which is a legacy of colonialism, that no local government is good, all local politicians are corrupt and someone on a white horse must charge in from the west to rescue them.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The reality at local level is very different. These countries have armies which have capacity to lift supplies and carry out emergency repairs that is not available to any development or disaster relief agency. The focus at UN and regional level should be on building and identifying that capacity and the commitment to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I have examined some of the reports regarding the aftermath of the tsunami. I welcome the Government's allocation but feel that when writing large cheques to UN organisations, we need much more accountability for how the money is spent. The Government has rightly been on the ropes in the House this week on the issue of consultants. The UN and its family of agencies probably have more per square foot than even Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, have ever considered having.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_480">There is a need to retain a sense of accountability. Preliminary reports on the tsunami spending indicate that in a fair number of cases money — not necessarily Irish money but generally — was not particularly well spent. There are problems. If one imports food from the rest of the world, does one wipe out local producers? If one imports textiles, blankets and so on, does one wipe out local capacity?</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Some years ago, a course was run by a very eminent Irish-American physician, Dr. Cahill, in the College of Surgeons to prepare for disasters. Codes of conduct regarding disasters, especially for agencies, were drawn up. That has not happened in recent years and perhaps the Department should consider supporting it. By their nature, people in non-governmental organisations move on over a six or ten-year period. Often they are relatively young. I thought the course I referred to was quite useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">We also have the efforts of the Army in the Curragh regarding the UN. Since the job is primarily for armies, we should consider drawing together like-minded countries and specialising in the development of rapid reaction capacity. Some years ago regulations for people such as nurses and doctors were changed to provide for emergency leave of absence, Ireland being very flexible in that regard. We have several agencies such as Concern particularly known for a high-quality, thought-out approach to the aftermath of a disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Global warming is relevant to the kinds of dreadful disasters besetting countries in Central America. We had hurricane Mitch and now we have hurricane Stan. They come in cycles and can be predicted. Working in concert with the countries of Latin America, particularly South America, and also with the United States, which have considerable capacity, Ireland should seek input into preparedness and rapid reaction. People in the US are still coming to terms with what did not happen in the aftermath of the destruction of New Orleans. The US army corps of engineers is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure, and it is interesting that it is only that corps that is really able to replace it. The United States itself has entered a period of reflection regarding how it was unable to cope.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I welcome the response of the Minister and the Department. There is a very large Pakistani community in Ireland, which I know has been to the fore in seeking to help fellow countrymen at home. It makes a great contribution to business and people working here. They have integrated very well, but most retain strong ties with home. Many are now happily married to Irish people, so there is a very large Irish-Pakistani community. I offer my condolences on behalf of the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">While the Indian part of Kashmir was affected to some extent, it was on nothing like the scale of what happened in Pakistan. It is interesting to reflect that, after independence more than 50 years ago, the Indians decided that they would have a national capacity to respond to the regular famines that then beset the country. That phenomenon of widespread famine has largely been dealt with by the Indian Government. Similarly, although the scale of the disaster was smaller, it has been able to provide a very extensive response in those areas of India affected by the disaster. There is local knowledge and expertise that we should respect and utilise.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Central America will be the cockpit of the adverse and extraordinary weather caused by global warming. The Irish development programme should seek a much more structured and extensive programme regarding the countries of Central America and several critical issues that face not only them but also South American ones, including what is happening to indigenous people. That is at the cutting edge of democratisation and respect for human rights. Unfortunately, the vast bulk of people affected by the dreadful consequences of the mudslides and so on are indigenous.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I know that the Minister is writing a White Paper and conducting a review of the principles of the Irish aid programme. I certainly hope that he will find space for a programme, in the context of the extra funds eventually made available by the Government, to include Latin America in a considered fashion and talk to people in the region about their priorities. He must also bear in mind the needs of indigenous communities in that region.</p>

          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_488">I reiterate my party's sympathy and condolences to those who suffered so disastrously in the recent tragic devastation of towns, villages, families and communities and acknowledge the human pain and misery created by it. The individual trauma of those who have been injured or lost all their belongings is incalculable. When, at a distance, we speak in broad terms regarding our concerns, we must always bear in mind that we are discussing real people who are suffering deep tragedy, many of whom will never fully recover from the effects, either physically or psychologically.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">When something of this nature happens, there is a tendency to blame, but there is no one to blame for these tragedies. We describe them as acts of God, so perhaps we can place the blame there. However, no government, person or organisation is to blame. We can question the capacity to respond, predict or prepare for such a tragedy, but we cannot blame people for the tragedy itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Massive destruction has taken place in six of the most northerly districts of North-Western Frontier Province and five districts in Azad, Jammu and Kashmir, including the provincial capital. The Minister of State said the death toll is in excess of 20,000 but reports suggest it could be as high as 40,000. Nobody can say for certain but the final figure will undoubtedly be higher than current estimates. Calculations are made on the basis of facts that are available at the time but it is obvious more deaths and injuries will come to the knowledge of the authorities. The non-fatal casualties are indeterminable but the final figure in this regard may be as high as 100,000. Where does one draw the line in categorising injuries? A person with a minor injury, for example, might be regarded as a non-fatal casualty.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">It is of significant concern that many of the fatalities were children. Every society will protect its children as a first line of defence. In the past, the safety of children and women was prioritised when, for example, a ship was sinking. On this occasion, unfortunately, children are high on the casualty list because they were at school at the time the earthquake struck. As the Minister of State observed, the grief of their parents is incalculable. One can only offer one's sympathies to the people affected. Like other Members, I offer my sympathy also to members of the Pakistani community, which has made an invaluable contribution to Irish society and our economic recovery. Irish people's response to the tragedy should recognise that contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I welcome the Government's contribution of €3 million to the relief effort. Will the Minister of State clarify that this money comes from the special emergency fund rather than the Third World fund? There was concern in the aftermath of the St. Stephen's Day tsunami that relief money should not be taken from the Government's allocation to the Third World. I assume the money being donated in the aftermath of this latest tragedy will be taken from a separate emergency fund.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_243" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_493">The budget line for this relief effort is from devoted emergency assistance resources. Of the funding allocated for relief in the wake of the St. Stephen's Day tsunami, €10 million came from the existing emergency fund and an additional €10 million was sanctioned by the Department of Finance, bringing the total contribution to €20 million. In this case, it will not be necessary to seek additional finance because money is available for this particular purpose. In general, a much more enhanced level of funding in the emergency and recovery fund will be required in future because we have seen how it has been stretched this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_494">My concerns in this regard arise from my awareness of the situation in Africa. In Ghana, for example, which does not have any serious hunger problems, most of the rural population are living on $1 a day. On a visit earlier this year, I met some Irish missionaries who have worked there for 40 or 50 years and who outlined the difficulties encountered by the people there on a daily basis. I also visited an AIDS clinic and hospital. The need for assistance to combat the AIDS problem in Africa is so profound that any statement which attempts to express that need is insufficient because it is beyond words. I saw young children dying of AIDS and children orphaned through the death of their parents from AIDS.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I also visited the UN support team, which receives funding from the Irish Government for its work. There is a need for an evaluation of the work undertaken by the UN, a wealthy organisation of which, like all such organisations, there must be careful monitoring of how it applies its funds. The UN requires the same level of examination as we apply to the Government in terms of ensuring we get value for money. There is no desire that the UN's front-line staff should be on the bread line but they must be responsive to the situations they are assigned to manage.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Ireland has earned a strong international reputation for responding generously to emergency humanitarian crises globally. As a result, we have a level of influence beyond our size in respect of humanitarian issues. We must use this influence within the UN to promote a better and more organised response and a new approach to dealing with disasters such as this. Like the peacekeeping forces that come together over a period of time under the auspices of the UN, there is no reason a mechanism could not be put in place whereby emergency forces could be drawn from different countries, ready to move to a disaster when summoned by the UN. A section of the Army could be trained in this area and made ready to respond as part of a co-ordinated UN response to a disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The logistical difficulties in regard to such missions are well known. Emergency aid, food, clothing and so on are transported by the Red Cross and other organisations but there are often major difficulties in distributing that aid to remote regions. Helicopters have been used to some effect in recent times but problems remain. As was the case in the aftermath of many other disasters, questions have been asked about the efficiency of the response to the earthquake. We in the West have a special duty towards the Third World, where most disasters occur, to be prepared to respond immediately rather than worrying about interfering with a particular government's autonomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The UN must be on call and immediately available with a rapid response and prepared programme to deal with the situation. As others have said, the aftermath of these types of disasters is predictable. We know there will be flooding in South America next year and there will be a serious earthquake somewhere in the Middle East. The UN must take responsibility way beyond what it is currently doing so it can respond effectively to such foreseen emergencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">We all offer our sympathy to those affected by the severe flooding in Central America, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan. The Government has made a contribution of €1 million to the relief efforts following this disaster. I have never visited this area but have a great interest in it. Having read extensively about the region, I am aware of how vast and underdeveloped much of it is and that some of the mountain areas are largely inaccessible. Having read in great detail several books on Ché Guevara, one has almost an intimate knowledge of his time in Bolivia in the mountains where he could remain for so long without being identified. It is so bleak and so removed from what we regard as normal that the difficulties experienced there are special. A response to meet that situation should be made available and ready by the authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">On 11 October the UN launched a €272 million flash appeal for the south Asian earthquake. This covers the life saving and early recovery activities for the six months emergency phase in a remote region with enormous logistical difficulties where landslides have cut off many roads. Access is possible only by foot and helicopter. More than 80% of buildings have been destroyed in some areas. Priority needs include shelter, winter size tents, plastic sheets, blankets, mattresses, nutrition, pre-cooked can food, high energy biscuits and survival rations, medicines, antibiotics, typhoid medicine, first aid and surgical kits, water purification tablets and transport, mostly helicopters.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Heavy rain has made much of the city uninhabitable and mudslides make access to those in need very difficult. General access to the area is incredibly difficult. Only one small road is open for light vehicles. They are dependent on heavy lifting logistics equipment, helicopters and air lifting logistics capacity which are critical for lifesaving assistance. One of the most urgent needs is shelter material for the 2.5 million homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Medical care is also required immediately as most of the hospitals and health care centres have been destroyed. Food and clean water are also in short supply in many towns and villages in Pakistan administered Kashmir and the north western frontier province, the most affected areas. The towns have been totally wiped out. UN agencies are already on the ground bringing in convoys of relief. The United Nations Human Rights Commission has also begun distributing basic relief supplies to up to 100,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_504">I extend my sincere sympathies to the Government and people of Pakistan on the appalling tragedy. The Pakistan community in Ireland has been greatly distressed by that tragedy and some members of that community are good friends of mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">To take up a point made by Deputy Neville, on a day when the Irish Government has produced its White Paper on the draft EU constitution, a significant element of which refers to the EU's development of its foreign policy, it is extraordinary, as Deputy Neville has said, given the absolute predictability of these earthquakes that we — not particularly Ireland but other countries — have not been able to pursue with the same vigour evident in the sale and purchase of arms a coherent plan to address disasters which come with frightening rapidity.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I have no doubt there is a grand plan available for the inevitable earthquake that is expected to occur on the west coast of America in the not too distant future. It is a great pity that the poorer countries of the world, many of which have experienced awful disasters in recent years, have to experience the trauma of what the people of Pakistan are experiencing. It must be possible, as Deputy Neville and others have said, for a rapid response arrangement to be available rather than have to listen to the pleadings of media journalists, explain that a particular pathway is not negotiable while people are sleeping on mattresses on the ground and on the streets and waiting for days on end for their own government to respond. No national government on its own is able to respond to a natural disaster such as has been experienced in Asia or in South America.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I urge the House to consider how it can contribute to developing the foreign policy of the European Union in a co-ordinated way. Ireland is among the most enlightened communities in the world and is in a position to react better than most. We certainly have the financial capacity to react. Let us set our jealousies, if any, aside on occasions such as this. We cannot have children starving, people dying of thirst and hunger.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">We have seen hundreds of children crushed under badly constructed buildings. Would it be possible for the world professional community, such as architects, surveyors and engineers to make their professional expertise available to poorer countries or to develop new building technologies so buildings in Turkey, Bam and Pakistan do not collapse like a house of card or dominos? If they did nothing else, that kind of contribution would be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I compliment the Government on its speedy response. The NGOs will do the job they have always done and do it extremely well and the International Red Cross will not be found wanting. While planning is required, the official international community, through the United Nations and the European Union, is required to do it. Earlier today I met some people from Ethiopia and I have just left a meeting with some people from Burma, all of whom have experienced their own disasters. The story is the same the world over but the lessons have not been learned. It is high time that Ireland, as a country with moral authority which does not have a vested interest in the territorial interests of any particular country other than our own, exerted serious moral direction on the rest of the world to ensure this kind of disaster does not occur again.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I extend my sympathies to all those affected by the disasters in Asia and South America and urge that Ireland become a pioneer in preparing a disaster plan which inevitably will be required on a fairly regular basis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_511">I thank all Members on a cross-party basis for the intelligent, sympathetic and insightful contributions made in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I was struck particularly by the contribution of the last speaker, Deputy Carey, who urged that Ireland should lead the process of discussion, negotiation and hard change at a UN and international level in terms of how Ireland will respond in future to disasters of this kind. I am uniquely aware of this given that I am just one year in my job. In that year there has been a crisis in Niger, we have had the tsunami, the whole issue of food security in the sub-Saharan Sahel region and the flooding in Central America. They beg not only for a domestic response but an international response that is coherent and focused on the job to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Ireland has led the way in regard to the crisis response mechanism that exists at a domestic and international level. I do not say that to take credit for this Government or any other Government. This response has been built up carefully in our aid programme over a number of years ranging from former Ministers of State who contributed to the debate, Deputies Burton, O'Donnell, and many others, including, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who have made an enormous contribution to our aid programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Ireland is regarded seriously in terms of our response to these crises. In 1999 when the OECD conducted its peer group review, Ireland ranked "among the cutting edge of development policy" and was singled out for praise in regard to the manner in which it approached the emergency response and recovery. It is not the case that we are faltering or lagging behind in this area. We are up there with the best in the world in terms of utilising best practice. Deputies have asked how we can leverage the level of expertise we have brought to bear as a small player with a strong moral voice in these matters and transmute it into the international response, which is acknowledged to be clearly wanting.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Mr. Jan Egeland, head of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, which is the lead UN agency for such crises, has acknowledged that the crisis response mechanism is deeply stretched at this time. This is not least because of the many and varied crises it has had to address this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">In conjunction with the UK, we led a study into crisis emergency response mechanisms which confirmed that the Irish response has been very good. A few weeks ago, I attended the UN summit with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. While there, I attended a round-table meeting with Jan Egeland and other UN officials. Mr. Egeland has made a proposal for reforming the central emergency revolving fund or CERF facility. The fund, which is loan-based, not grant-based, stands at €40 million. Mr. Egeland's proposal was that this would become a grant-based standing fund of €500 million. It would provide the financial mechanism to cope with the enormous financial and logistical demands on the UN and individual countries — in this case Pakistan — when natural disasters, including earthquakes, occur. We fully support the proposed reform of the CERF mechanism within a tight timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">However CERF is reformed, it should not supplant or take away from existing funds available for emergencies. At the UN summit in New York, the United Kingdom signalled its support by stating it would make a minimum contribution of €40 million to such a fund, presumably over a number of years. The Swedish Government also indicated that it would pledge a minimum amount of €14 million to the same fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">In the coming days, I hope to be in a position to signal the minimum pledge Ireland will be able to make to that fund. I am anxious to make this pledge to indicate our general spirit of goodwill towards the creation and management of such a fund. In common with other donor countries, we have issues about how such a fund should be managed and, critically, that it should not take away from existing funds available from UN and other agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I will soon be able to signal that we will participate in the emergency fund, which will have the flexibility to respond to these crises where the immediate requirement is cash. We often hear people of goodwill providing material contributions which are not really effective. Earlier this year, we saw the scenes in Banda Aceh where large amounts of unwanted clothes were stored in sheds. It is important to apply clear principles when it comes to providing humanitarian assistance. In many respects, cash is the best contribution an individual or a country can make in such circumstances. By its nature, cash can be used to deploy quickly the necessary food and other supplies required following crises of this kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I was struck by the contribution of my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Connor, who said there is a real danger of donor fatigue following the appeals for aid in Pakistan and Central America. People may not respond as warmly and generously to these appeals as they did to earlier ones. Clearly, there have been many such appeals this year. When the enormous commercial push of the Christmas season approaches in this wealthy country, I ask individuals and businesses to set aside some money for humanitarian appeals that are being launched by the non-governmental organisations for Central America and, more importantly, Pakistan given the death toll there. I appeal to people to respond generously, perhaps by curtailing the normal spending spree over the Christmas period. They should take into consideration the awful situation faced by survivors of the earthquake in Pakistan and the mudslides in Central America.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I know that the Irish people will respond as best they can. The Government wishes to prompt such generosity from them, given the strong contribution made here by the Pakistani community as well as the wider Muslim community in Ireland. This is a unique opportunity for us to show our solidarity with the Muslim population of Ireland who, following various global events in recent years, may feel that they are placed apart. Let me assure them that they are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Deputy Murphy referred to Japan, which illustrates the issue of preparedness. There are large coastal protection barriers on the west coast of Japan designed to protect that country from a maritime disaster such as a tsunami. Large concrete structures have been placed in the sea to prevent such a disaster. In addition, Japanese offices and homes contain early-warning systems to detect earth tremors. Systems are also in place there to prevent buildings collapsing during an earthquake. It is not rocket science but Japan has mastered the art of disaster preparedness, given the country's vulnerability to earthquakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">That preparedness demonstrates the importance of the development agenda. While poor countries do not have such systems, rich countries like Japan do. I am not saying that Japan is beyond the reach of an earthquake, but the risks have been minimised thanks to the early-warning systems that have been put in place. That preparedness is due to Japanese planning methods and the country's wealth. We need to bring such planning methods to less developed countries which we assist through our aid programmes. They need to be helped in coping with the threat of natural disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">In January, I visited Mauritius for the conference of small island development states in the wake of the tsunami disaster. Through our aid programme we funded significant research on a new environmental vulnerability index which will help policymakers to decide what factors make countries vulnerable to such phenomena and how they can be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I commend Deputy Gormley on his point on the environment. There are issues we can master concerning the physical environment to minimise the risks involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">I assure Deputy Burton and Deputy Michael D. Higgins that, as regards broader Government policy in the development sphere, we are closely examining the possibility of expanding our overseas aid programme. We are looking at the issue of geographical spread in connection with our ability to learn and help other people around the world. Specifically, we are examining the possibility of establishing an aid programme in a Latin American country. We will be evaluating that matter carefully. We are not neglecting that region but our primary focus is on Africa. Deputy Neville is correct in that nothing we disperse on the disaster in Pakistan, or any future disasters, will divert funds from our ongoing, long-term development programme. The latter is primarily focused on the least-developed countries of Africa where the world's greatest poverty exists and, thus, people's needs are more acute.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Deputy Coveney spoke passionately and said that Ireland has real credibility in the areas of human rights and development. As Minister of State, I assure the House that the issues of human rights, environmental vulnerability and crisis response will be to the forefront of our actions as we expand our aid programme. We have set a date of 2012 to achieve the UN target figure of 0.7% of gross national product. We will achieve that target date but we must plan our expenditure carefully to do so. Ireland must be a leading voice internationally. Ireland is a small country that is punching way above its weight globally in the development and diplomatic spheres. To do that we must be a leading advocate for best practice and timely response led by the UN asserting the primacy of the UN in all situations of international conflict or crises such as we have seen in Pakistan.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I again thank all the Members for their very generous contributions. I am greatly encouraged by the discussion and by the points made my many of them. It is ironic that some powerful countries spend huge amounts of money on defence commitments and yet none of these amounts are available to help when a disaster occurs. It poses a very serious question to those countries and not to Ireland, which has had a leading role in the area of disarmament and development. This is a tribute not just to this Government but also to all previous Governments that have contributed to our development co-operation programme. I thank all the former Ministers who contributed.</p>

            <p eId="para_530">Tenders for the provision of a national conference centre in the Dublin area were received from two consortia by the Office of Public Works on 20 May last, the deadline for the receipt of tenders. The rigorous assessment and evaluation of these tenders has now been completed and the report of the evaluation panel submitted to the national conference centre steering group. I expect a provisional preferred tenderer to be designated shortly. Subject to the outcome of the negotiations that will follow designation of the provisional preferred tenderer, it is envisaged that a decision on the award of the contract will be brought to Government at the earliest opportunity in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_531">In the meantime, the Deputy will appreciate that I am constrained in what I can say at this stage in the process, and while I share the frustration of the House at the complex and exacting procedures involved, I am obliged not to jeopardise the competition and its successful conclusion by any departure from the strict rules and procedures involved.</p>

In this case it seems the Dublin Port Company did not first put its site up for tender in order to protect the interest of the taxpayer. Surely what has happened here does not abide by the laws governing public procurement. We do not want another legal action, which could arise if all the procedures are not fully complied with in the case of the national conference centre.</p>

The procedures involved in a public private partnership are complex.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">As part of the procedural requirements a public sector benchmark exercise and a benefit assessment were required before the detailed proposals could be initiated. In addition the preparation of the detailed project contract documentation was demanding and time consuming with details requiring careful scrutiny and consideration. The issue of the tender documentation to tenderers was followed by a lengthy process of consultation with the tenders intended, <i>inter alia</i>, to enable the OPW to provide clarification and where appropriate to take account of issues raised by tenderers thereby helping to ensure the quality and robustness of the tenders to be submitted. More recently the tenders received were required to undergo a rigorous and thorough assessment and evaluation. However, the report of the evaluation panel has been submitted to the steering group and we expect a provisional preferred tenderer to be designated shortly.</p>

The Minister received a letter from the stud owners' representative and secretary to the industry committee, the professional trainers' representative, the chairman of the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation, the chairman of the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association, the bookmakers' representative and the private greyhound stadia representative.

I would not make an appointment if I felt he were in any way restricted from serving on the board. I was advised he was not so restricted. At the time of the reappointment of the person there was no restriction on him from being a member of the board.

We are seeing record attendances, prize money and sponsorship along with a record number of dogs in training.

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Arts, Sport</b>
        and Tourism the position regarding the artists’ exemption scheme; if a cost and benefit analysis has been applied to the scheme; his views regarding the ongoing retention of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [28423/05]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_260" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_550">I have consistently argued that the tax exemption for artists has very positive effects on the arts in Ireland. The scheme was innovative and imaginative from the outset, and the benefits are many. This scheme increases the level of artistic activity, encourages artists to stay with the arts rather than moving to more lucrative occupations, makes Ireland a more attractive place for artists to live and enhances our image throughout the arts world internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">For most artists, the questions of milking the system or making vast dividends from the scheme simply do not arise. Earnings in the arts, unfortunately, are low, and the issue facing most artists is that of economic survival. It is clear that most of those benefiting under the scheme are very low earners. Revenue's own figures for 2001 show that more than 50% of beneficiaries had earnings of less than €10,000 per annum and 90% had less than €50,000 per annum. The very low-income figures available from Revenue for this scheme must be viewed in the context of very uneven earnings profiles. An artist who earns €50,000 in a given year may earn little or nothing in years either side of it. Annual earnings can be very much lower when averaged out.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">It has validly been pointed out that 2% of beneficiaries account for 58% of the exempted income, indicating that there is a small number of people who make very large amounts of money on which they do not pay tax. However, while equity suggests that capping the scheme would correct this, much of these earnings are foreign income which simply will not come here at all if the exemption goes. The really high earners are predominantly musicians, and research carried out in 2002 indicated that 97% of the income of the top twenty music recording artists is from foreign sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_553">Essentially, the anticipated benefits of adjusting the scheme are likely to be outweighed by the negatives. I have made these views known to my colleague, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Finance, and officials of our two Departments have had detailed consultations on the issues, which are continuing. It will ultimately be a matter for the Government to decide on the continuation of this and other tax concessions in the context of its consideration of the outcome of the general review of tax concessions initiated by the Minister for Finance.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
            <p eId="para_554">Has the Minister for Finance confirmed that the artists' exemption scheme was not among the 30 such schemes being reviewed? Has the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism made his views known to the Minister for Finance in terms of the secondary benefits to the country? For example, personalities such as Bono, Neil Jordan, Jim Sheridan and even Cecelia Ahern may earn large amounts of money in a particular calendar year but perhaps not earn money in the previous year or the year after. They still earn large amounts of money, and the media tend to portray this as money for artists rolling in on the back of State subvention.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">Does the Minister agree it would be beneficial to carry out a cost benefit analysis based for example on the spin-off employment created by the members of U2 remaining in Ireland, with Japanese tourists for example coming to meet their heroes, to meet the writers who inspire them? Such an analysis, possibly commissioned by the Arts Council, would back up the Minister's valid argument that the exemption scheme has benefitted the artistic community in this country. If it could be proven that the scheme provides great economic benefit as well as the social capital, the analysis would put an end to any talk of toying with a cap on the scheme.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_262" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_556">I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Gogarty in his assessment of the situation. My understanding is that the Minister for Finance initiated a review of tax reliefs which would include the artists' exemption scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">It should be recalled that the exemption is for works that are creative and artistic and that they must have cultural and-or artistic merit. These hurdles must be cleared before the work concerned qualifies for the exemption in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_558">The vast majority of people in the arts community earn very low salaries and in many cases their income is quite sporadic. As I said earlier, on either side of a good year they can have very bad years. The argument is made that the exemption should be capped at a certain level because 2 per cent of those involved seem to get 58 per cent of the benefit. However, this must be understood in the context that much of the income derived by those at the top of the scale comes from foreign sources. The argument can be very cogently put that these are funds which would not arrive in Ireland if the exemption was not there. One can also argue, as Deputy Gogarty has done, that the people concerned assist in giving the country a very high profile and it is difficult to quantify the benefit for the overall economy in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">The exemption sends out a very positive image of the arts in Ireland, of artists working in Ireland. Its introduction was imaginative and innovative. It portrays the country internationally as one which nurtures the arts. Since its introduction it has provided a positive image for Ireland. Tinkering with the scheme will achieve very little in the final analysis. I do not believe in implementing ideas solely on the basis of a principle. There must be a pragmatic, tangible return if one is to become a legislator for principle, and in this instance I do not see the return.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
            <p eId="para_560">I thank the Minister for his reply. Certain exemption schemes involve holiday homes, or stallion services, and nobody can say that the work of a stallion is of any intrinsic artistic merit. Could the Minister give a commitment before the House that he will ask the Arts Council to commission a cost benefit analysis so that the intrinsic social and economic benefit to this country of this scheme, even for high earners, can be finally proven, and that when the silly season comes around again we will not see the same stories scaring the life out of the poorer section of the artistic community?</p>

            <p eId="para_561">I have received voluminous correspondence about the scheme from people involved in the arts, and Deputy Gogarty is correct in saying they are very worried about the future of the scheme and in general terms support the retention of the scheme in its entirety, irrespective of their income. Regarding the artistic merit of a stallion, it all depends whether one bets on a winner or a loser.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_563">After proposals for redevelopment of the Abbey at its existing location or at the site of the former Carlton Cinema in O'Connell Street or on the former Coláiste Mhuire site in Parnell Square were ruled out for a variety of reasons, I authorised negotiations with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in connection with its offer of a site for the theatre at George's Dock. The Office of Public Works engaged in detailed discussions with the DDDA over recent months to clarify the availability and suitability of this site. These consultations have progressed to the point where I am in a position to say that a potentially suitable site at George's Dock, capable of satisfying the accommodation brief for the Abbey, is now on offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">In July 2005, the Government authorised investigative surveys to be carried out at the site to inform further decisions on the development of the theatre there. The Office of Public Works has arranged detailed examination of the site, including archaeological, geotechnical and structural surveys. These studies are scheduled for completion shortly and at that point I will take the project to the next phase.</p>

According to a recent media report, the Minister intends to do so shortly. Will the process involve an international architectural competition? I anticipate problems arising with a public private partnership approach to the national conference centre. The Minister accepts that too. It is a complex procedure. Does the Minister envisage a public private partnership being utilised to build the Abbey Theatre?</p>

            <p eId="para_566">It is my intention to bring a proposal to the Government shortly. I can confirm that the only site under consideration at present is the George's Dock site. I expect the full report from the OPW shortly, probably in a matter of weeks. At that point the proposal will be brought to Government. I expect that the construction of a new national theatre would result in an international competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">Whether it will be a public private partnership is a matter to be decided by the Government. There are arguments for and against. Some argue that if it were a public private partnership and if other commercial considerations were involved, it might be a success. Others argue that if it is to be a stand-alone project, it could not possibly succeed as a public private partnership. In any event, the Government must come to a decision about the site and I expect it to consider that within a short period. I will not waste a moment when I have the report from the Office of Public Works. I understand that the site is available free of charge.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_573">The Ryder Cup 2006 will be one of the greatest sporting events ever to come to Ireland. It will be a landmark not just for Irish golf but for Irish tourism generally, with 40,000 people attending the K Club each day along with 2,000 members of the media and 1 billion people worldwide watching the event on television.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">It is already nearly impossible to book accommodation for Ryder Cup week within 80 miles of the K Club. This provides the clearest possible indication of the appeal of the event and I trust that all these enterprises and other tourism service providers will do Ireland proud on this great occasion and give Ryder Cup visitors a traditional Irish welcome and a quality experience to remember. The value of word of mouth publicity cannot be underestimated and we want our visitors to return home with glowing reports about their stay here and confirmation that the hospitality and friendliness for which we are renowned really does exist. More importantly, we want them to be able to say that the golf was excellent, that they received value for money and that they want to come back again.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">I am aware of concerns being expressed by some about the risk of excessive prices being charged by certain elements of the Irish tourism and hospitality industry during next year's event. The State tourism agencies are being particularly vigilant in this area and in all their dealings with the industry are taking the opportunity to encourage a commonsense approach to the pricing of our tourism product. Notwithstanding the operation of free market forces, I particularly urge service providers to take a long-term perspective on the benefits of the event. These will only come about from positive word of mouth when our visitors return home. Golf tourism is important to us, which makes it all the more necessary that there should be no short-term or opportunistic exploitation of our visitors. It is my intention to raise these issues, as appropriate, in my regular contact with the industry in the build up to the Ryder Cup.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">I believe that Ireland will deliver value for money during the staging of the Ryder Cup. The vast majority of visitors will have purchased packages that have been priced now for quite some time. Furthermore, all approved accommodation providers will have published maximum prices that they cannot legally exceed. I intend to ask the Director of Consumer Affairs to undertake a special initiative around the time of the Ryder Cup to ensure that price lists in restaurants and public houses are displayed prominently.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">All sectors of the tourism industry are acutely aware of the value for money issue and the available research from Fáilte Ireland through its visitor attitude surveys suggests that, in an overall context, the consumer is satisfied with the cost of accommodation and the cost of the golfing product in Ireland. As the level of overseas competition continues to grow, I am assured that there is no complacency around the issue of value for money and that the tourism industry fully recognises that if we do not look after the consumer, we will lose market share.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_273">
            <from>Mr. Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_578">I welcome the thrust of the Minister's reply and the action he has outlined to ensure that the tourism industry does not suffer following this world famous event. We have seen the figures quoted in magazines and newspapers about the cost of houses and accommodation close to the course. That can be damaging. Keeping a watching brief on this is of utmost importance. I hope that through the various agencies, especially overseas and in the American market, the Minister's remarks today about conducting price analyses of what is provided will be emphasised. Every effort should be made to produce progress reports from the Minister, Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland that will appear in golf magazines and tourism brochures outlining the situation and assuring people that there will not be a rip-off.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">Not only will the K Club and adjacent golf courses benefit from this, it is an ideal opportunity to create a golf haven. We generally hear that Portugal and Spain are the golf havens of Europe but this tournament provides an opportunity to ensure that Ireland is included in that group. I hope the Minister, his Department and the agencies will do everything possible to promote that concept, especially on the American and European markets from where most of the followers of this event will come. What efforts will be made by the Department and the agencies to develop accommodation and other facilities for this world famous event?</p>

            <p eId="para_580">Every effort has been made to remind the industry of the need to offer value for money and the industry is responding. It remains a cause of concern that while the majority of visitors still say they really enjoyed their visit and would recommend Ireland to a friend, nonetheless, issues such as the cost of drink and eating out are still regarded as not giving value for money. The Department has made this point to the industry and it is responding.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">Golf tourism is important to the country. In the last year for which figures are available, 2003, 133,000 visitors came to play golf and they generated a revenue of €126 million. A golf visitor is worth up to three times more than an ordinary visitor because they stay longer, an average stay being 13 nights and they go to several locations. Last year Ireland was voted the number one golf destination in the world. The country contains one third of the links championship courses in the world. I do not play golf but some would argue that the whole country is a golf course because more than 400 golf courses are affiliated, which is a record for the size of the population.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_276" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_590">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 14, 39, 42, 43, 47 and 49 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">As the House is already aware, I have no direct responsibility in relation to individual actions or measures relating to tourism promotion or development in so far as specific areas of the country are concerned. These are day-to-day functions of the State tourism agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">The ITIC report referred to indicates that, contrary to the Deputy's suggestion, an increasing share of holiday bed nights is being spent in urban as opposed to rural locations in Ireland and that this decline is attributable in the most part to a decline in bed nights from the British market.</p>
            <p eId="para_593">The ITIC report has made a number of recommendations to address this difficulty, many of which are already being advanced by Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland, Shannon Development and the regional tourism authorities. National tourism policy has been evolving in recent years, with a particular emphasis on putting policy measures in place to achieve a wider spread of tourism business arising from the New Horizons policy review.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">The development of good quality direct access to the regions has been a major impediment to growth in the past. Fortunately, this has improved greatly in recent times and this summer has seen the greatest ever number of air seats to Ireland and particularly servicing the regions of the west and north west. These new routes from Britain, mainland Europe and the US continue to be promoted heavily by Tourism Ireland in order to optimise their tourism impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_595">The ITIC report is confined to examining trends in overseas holiday business to Ireland. If domestic tourism was included, the picture would be significantly different as a large proportion of this business favours the regions rather than Dublin. As the ITIC report rightly identifies, visitors cannot be forced to go to a particular location against their will. The responsibility primarily lies with the individual communities and operators in the regions to present and market compelling attractions, facilities, accommodation and experiences that deliver value for money and quality service.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">As I have already advised the House, Fáilte Ireland, in response to a recommendation in the tourism action plan set out in the report of the tourism policy review group, towards the end of last year commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct a major study of regional tourism structures, as it sought to determine how best to carry out its new development mandate countrywide. The report has been published and is available on the Fáilte Ireland website. This work was supplemented by a short engagement facilitated by a small independent group, chaired by Mr. John Travers, with the relevant parties in order to satisfy interests in the Dublin region that the mechanisms of consultation were complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">The PWC report highlights the need for a much wider brief for regional tourism, playing a strategic rather than administrative role and inputting more directly into national policy. It recommends a greatly increased emphasis on targeted marketing, product development and enterprise support. It suggests establishing an integrated linkage between regional tourism strategy and national policy and exploiting avenues to leverage increased resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">At the end of July, I indicated to Fáilte Ireland that I was satisfied it should proceed with the proposed revision of regional tourism structures on the basis of the PWC and Travers reports. An implementation group is being established to assist Fáilte Ireland in implementing the recommendations. Mr. Finbarr Flood has agreed to chair this group and has already begun his work. Fáilte Ireland expect that changes will be seen in the regions by the middle of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">At a time of overall national tourism growth, I remain concerned that the issue of regional spread should be proactively and energetically addressed. In that context I am pleased the programmes and initiatives being operated by the State tourism agencies and the action plan set out in the report of the tourism policy review group fully reflect this objective. Such programmes and initiatives include the strategic investment in the sustainable development of tourism capital infrastructure in underperforming areas through the tourism product development scheme, which aims to match the quality of the product available on the ground with ever greater consumer expectations; the different levels of support offered to regional tourism authorities for marketing purposes; an expanded domestic tourism marketing campaign; the use of predominantly rural imagery in the advertising and promotion of Ireland, both at home and abroad; the regional coverage with respect to visiting media; and the specific focus on achieving a wide spread of visitors in respect of access to transport policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">In total this year, Fáilte Ireland is investing in the order of €27 million on developing regional tourism, from supporting local festivals to building capability and strengthening the tourism product. To assist the promotion and development of tourism by the regions, Fáilte Ireland is channelling in the region of €7.4 million directly into the regional tourism companies to strengthen and enhance their operational and marketing capabilities this year. This investment is designed to ensure both a high quality visitor servicing experience at key tourism information offices and also a strong overseas promotional effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">In their programmes for 2005, both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland are rolling out a number of innovative approaches which should heighten the regional impact of Ireland's marketing activities both nationally and overseas. All regions will feature prominently in the full range of marketing activities; a dedicated marketing fund for tactical co-operative initiatives with the regional tourism authorities and their members is available for 2005; a region to region approach is being adopted in Britain which is capitalising on direct access links to the regions; specific marketing campaigns involving joint co-operation activities by the regional tourism authorities and other regional interests have been launched for both the western seaboard and the north west this year; a sponsor a region approach has been adopted in Europe whereby each market office is focusing attention alternately on a particular Irish region in order to enhance the awareness of the local trade of what that region has to offer; an enhanced consumer website with increased functionality and a strong regional input is providing for more dynamic and up-to-the minute packages to entice the domestic traveller; and a strong focus on event-based holidays is being complemented by a more streamlined and targeted festivals and cultural events fund which will continue to favour the lesser-developed regions.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_277">
            <from>Mr. Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_602">I thank the Minister for such a detailed reply. It seems Ireland has become a short-stay destination. The Ryder Cup was referred to in the previous question. Golfers stay longer and I am hopeful the Ryder Cup will have an influence in tempting people to travel outside the Pale and visit golf courses in the regions. I suggest they be given a badge to allow them visit all the golf courses in a particular area as is the custom for racecourses.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">The CEO of Fáilte Ireland has stated Punchestown will be highlighted as being a national festival, on a par with Cheltenham. This aspect of promotion of value for money can be repeated in other areas of tourism. The Galway races has its own niche in the tourism sector. I note that national hunt racing does not seem to be a problem yet the only big days for flat racing are when the classic races are run and the biggest day is derby day. We do not seem to be successful in attracting interest from the US and Europe for flat racing compared to national hunt racing. Has Fáilte Ireland or other tourism agencies examined the uses made of grant funding? We certainly have a wide spectrum of opportunities, including the website, which must be oriented towards developing tourism. Are we getting true value for the money being invested to attract visitors from the United Kingdom? Given the high value of the British pound against the euro, one would expect to see a major increase in the British market, but that does not appear to be the case. This is reflected in what I said earlier about flat racing. We have the Curragh meeting and many other classic flat racing events but we do not seem to be drawing British tourists to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">What can be done to increase the percentage of visitors from the United Kingdom? It seems obvious from a monetary point of view, given the value of the pound, that British tourists should be attracted to this country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_278" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_605">The festivals and cultural events initiative has been an enormous success. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the support given by Fáilte Ireland to various festivals throughout the country, which has not been and possibly cannot be quantified, has been an enormous success. The numbers of visitors coming to festivals that have been supported by Fáilte Ireland is quite impressive.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">It is more difficult to attract visitors to flat racing meetings. However, it should be noted that in excess of 60,000 visitors come to Ireland every year for horse racing. Punchestown is a good example of an outstanding festival and others like Fairyhouse, Galway, Listowel, Tralee, Killarney and Laytown have also proven to be tremendous successes. There is a great deal of synergy between Horse Racing Ireland and Fáilte Ireland and a recognition that they should work together to ensure we maximise the potential which these events have for attracting visitors to the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">The Ryder Cup is simply enormous for Ireland and in particular for Deputy Wall's native county of Kildare. It will attract approximately 40,000 visitors per day, which is the maximum amount the course can hold, and the television audience will be massive. It is estimated that the television audience could be up to 1 billion people worldwide. The kind of coverage that this event will afford the country could not be bought if one went to the marketplace seeking to do so. It is important that the Ryder Cup is an enormous success and I have no doubt that it will be so. All the portents suggest that people are organising extremely well for it in Kildare and that the country in general is prepared for what will be a massive influx of visitors. Even now it is almost impossible to book accommodation within an 80 mile radius of the K Club for the duration of the Ryder Cup.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">Last year we were concerned that there was a 1% decline in UK visitor numbers. That is quite serious in terms of the British market because 4.75 million of our visitors come from Britain, so a 1% drop represents 47,500. However, the first six months of this year show an increase of 2%, which is very encouraging as it represents an increase in UK visitor numbers of 95,000. That is due to an increased marketing fund and a very aggressive marketing campaign that has been going on in Britain for almost a year. That campaign has focused on promoting the regions because visitors who bring their cars to Ireland, with their families, are the ones who go out into the regions. That is why we have been working so hard to attract back the British visitors. During the World Cup, when the inclination might be to back some side against England, people might remember our British visitors.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_279">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_609">Does the Minister envisage that the recommendations contained in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report will be implemented for the 2006 tourism season? If not, it would be advisable to postpone any proposed changes until the 2007 season. We had difficulties this year in north Kerry when the transition from Shannon Development to Fáilte Ireland meant that promotion of the region never really got off the ground. People were appointed too late and promotion simply did not happen. If major changes are planned for the regional tourism authorities, RTAs, that will lead to disruption and will affect the promotion of tourism in the regions. Will the Minister confirm whether the changes proposed will be in place by 2006? If not, I suggest that they are put in place for the 2007 season.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">There are approximately 61 tourism information offices throughout the country. People in places such as Listowel are fearful that some of these offices will be closed following the review. Will the Minister clarify if this is so? Will he give a commitment that none of the existing tourism information offices will be closed following the review?</p>
            <p eId="para_611">The Irish Tourism Industry Confederation report, referred to in the question, identified north Kerry as a special pilot area for marketing and future development. Will the Minister give a commitment to this House — I understand he has already given one to Kerry representatives from Cork Kerry Tourism — that north Kerry will be declared a pilot area for future tourism marketing and development because it has underperformed for some time now?</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Is the Minister concerned that the number of visitors from the United States has decreased this year? In terms of regional tourism, US visitors traditionally went to places like Kerry and the west because, generally speaking, that is where their ancestors came from. There has been a decline in tourism along the western seaboard and in the regions because the number of tourists coming from the US has dropped.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">The number of hill walkers coming to Ireland has almost halved since 1999. This is because a number of walkways are no longer accessible to walkers because landowners have fenced them off. Also, in some parts of the country there is a hostile reception for walkers. Does the Department or Fáilte Ireland have any proposals to encourage more hill walkers to come here? I understand that there is an initiative by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has brought together a type of rural forum, but it does not appear to be making any progress.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_280" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_614">The hill walking issue is the responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, who set up a council known as Comhairle na Tuaithe, which is charged with trying to open up the countryside. I understand that the council has made some progress in this respect and it is important that it does so. The number of hill walkers coming here has been reduced significantly because of a decision by a minority of landowners to close off their lands to walkers. However, there are vast expanses of the country where hill walkers are quite welcome and where landowners do not inhibit walking in any way. We should accentuate the positive whenever we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">With regard to the marketing of north Kerry, arrangements may have been reached at the Cork Kerry Tourism level which would not have reached Fáilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland. I will investigate the matter and communicate with the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">With regard to the US market, the first six months of this year indicated a decline in the numbers coming from the United States, despite the fact that we have increased capacity. This should level out, particularly because of the decision of American Airlines to fly into Ireland this summer. The increase in capacity from approximately 1 May was 17.5% from the United States, which should have been reflected in increased visitor numbers. We will only know this when we see the figures from the Central Statistics Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">Reports that tourism offices throughout the country will close as a result of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on regional tourism is not correct. I am not aware of any suggestion that offices should close in Listowel or elsewhere. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report indicated that there was a greater role for regional tourism authorities, that there should be six of these, that there should be an umbrella group, that the chair of each regional group should be on the umbrella group and that the tourism groups at a regional level should be involved in future product development, enterprise support and marketing.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">Mr. Finbarr Flood, who is chair of the implementation group, has already begun his work and I expect all the work will be completed by the middle of next year and that all the relevant structures should be in place by then. That is the assurance I have been given. Before going into high season next year, the relevant authorities and their powers will have been reinvigorated, renewed and expanded.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_623">While my Department has no statutory or regulatory responsibility in the area of ticket touting and ticket forgery, the three main national governing bodies of sport, the GAA, IRFU and FAI, were consulted by departmental officials on the issue some time ago. These consultations revealed a strong commitment on the part of the governing bodies to the elimination of ticket touting in respect of the sporting events under their control and they have systems in place to deal with ticket touting which enable them to trace any touted ticket to the person to whom it was issued and to take any action considered appropriate. In addition, a number of organisations have sophisticated systems in place aimed at eliminating ticket forgery, which can be experienced at major sporting events, and which prevent forged ticket holders from gaining entry to events.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Legal advice obtained by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation in 2001 indicated that responsibility for arrangements to ensure the availability of tickets on a fair basis and the enforcing of such arrangements is primarily a matter for the event organisers themselves. In light of the policies of the major sporting organisations in combating ticket touting, the enactment of legislation may not be required at this time.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_284">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_625">The Minister may be aware of a Private Members' Bill which I introduced in May regarding ticket touting, the Prohibition of Ticket Touts Bill. In view of the fact that the IRFU, the FAI, the GAA and Ticketmaster supported the Bill, and Ticketmaster said it was a genuine attempt to tackle the scourge of touts, the Government should accept the Bill as a positive way forward. Will he give a commitment today that, if I introduce the Bill during Private Members' time, the Government will support it in view of the support it has received from everyone involved in organising concerts or major games?</p>
            <p eId="para_626">Will the Minister agree that it was a scandal that the ticket touts who ripped-off people who bought tickets to attend the Eminem concert last summer were refunded the money? This indicates the need for legislation in this whole area. Is he aware of legislation in most states in the US to cover this activity, which is referred to as ticket scalping? There is legislation in England that forbids the sale of tickets near sports grounds and so on. As far as I am aware, this is now the only country that has no legislation to deal with the scourge of ticket touting.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">Before the all-Ireland, in front of the Gresham Hotel, I witnessed an individual who arrived from America that morning paying €2,000 for two tickets, which is not fair. The GAA, the FAI and the IRFU will find it very difficult to track tickets because they can be passed on to different people. A ticket could change hands four times before someone eventually sits on the seat. It is very difficult to track tickets.</p>

People who train under age teams were last night asking me to try to get tickets for the international soccer match. Many emigrants must pay over the odds for a ticket when they return to Ireland to see their county team in Croke Park. A number of them paid €1,000 for tickets for this year's all-Ireland football final. Legislation must be introduced to address this problem.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_297" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_643">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 32 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">The records of all public bodies are increasingly being created and maintained electronically. The long-term preservation of departmental records in electronic form is the responsibility of the National Archives. However, in the short term each Department, office or court is responsible for the preservation of its own electronic records, that is, until such time as they are obliged to lodge them with the National Archives in accordance with the relevant legislation. All other public bodies are responsible for both the short-term and the long-term preservation of their own electronic records.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">The National Archives has in the past undertaken surveys by questionnaire to assess the extent of record-generating computer systems across the Civil Service and the types of records being generated by such systems. It is evident there are large quantities of such records. More recently, pilot surveys have been undertaken focusing on specific specialised systems. Systems surveyed have included those of the Revenue Commissioners and the Land Registry. The National Archives has also undertaken a number of pilot projects to establish how certain types of electronic records might be preserved over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">I am responsible for the State papers transferred to the National Archives. The work of the body is set out in the National Archives Act 1986. The Act requires the National Archives to acquire, preserve, restore and display departmental records and to make these available to the public. Section 14 of the Act empowers the Minister to approve a place, other than the National Archives itself, to receive deposits of specified departmental records and for this to constitute a transfer to the National Archives. I do not propose to remove all archival material held throughout the country by different bodies into the care of the National Archives.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">The body is considering how best to meet its responsibility to effect the permanent preservation of digital archives. In many cases, long-term preservation may best be effected by transfer to the National Archives. In other cases, particularly where specialised, purpose designed systems are concerned, it may be wiser, safer and more economically sensible to preserve digital records within the agencies in which they were created. Should that option be pursued, the National Archives would have to be satisfied that it would enable it to meet its responsibilities regarding the preservation and access by systematic monitoring, inspection and reporting. Typically, the National Archives website would become a hub through which such records would be made available for public inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">The problems involved in storing electronic records are different from those connected with the storage of paper files. Large electronic record keeping systems require only a small fraction of the space required to hold the paper records. Electronic record keeping requires ongoing expenditure on hardware, software and human expertise on a scale that has no parallel in the world of paper records. Stored in the right conditions, paper is inherently durable whereas there is no proven long-term storage medium for the preservation of records in digital form. To guard against loss of records due to the physical deterioration of the media on which they are stored, regular and continuing migration of such records to new storage media is required. Records created in proprietary software systems will have to be carried forward through later versions of these proprietary formats or, if practicable, exported to non-proprietary formats for permanent preservation. Maintaining functionality of systems over time in these circumstances will be difficult to guarantee and potentially costly to implement. Migration of records to new systems and formats will have to be undertaken in ways that will ensure their authenticity, reliability and evidential value over time.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_298">
            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_649">I thank the Minister. This is quite a challenge for the State as a large number of paper records exists. While I accept records are archived primarily for their legal admissibility, they have a significant heritage value. Professionals with both archiving and information technology skills are needed to decide which records are appropriate to maintain and a significant number of people with these skills would be required to service each State body. A perfect system is not available because the technology involved is being progressed all the time. Britain has instituted a location where records are stored, upgraded and maintained and it is a cost effective way to archive.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">The Minister replied to a parliamentary question I tabled on Tuesday on this topic in the context of the decentralisation programme, which poses additional challenges. He stated a risk analysis is under way. Who is carrying it out? When is it likely to conclude? He also stated an individual had been appointed to the National Archives to work on the issue of best practice in this regard but the individual had resigned recently. Is one person sufficient to do this work? When will that report be available?</p>
            <p eId="para_651">Computer systems have been revolutionised, even over the past 30 years, and the notion of storing large spools of records is laughable. The Minister must consider this in deciding in what format material should be maintained and the number of records to be held, which should be minimised so that only the most important records are archived. We are all guilty of information overload and, for example, many of us keep e-mails, which are not relevant. However, this is not only an IT issue but an archival issue in terms of which records are appropriate to archive. Will the Minister consider using one location for archiving? Given the experience in the local authority system where archivists are employed intermittently or are sometimes shared among several local authorities, there are not sufficient people with the necessary skills available to decide what needs to be stored and how it should be stored throughout the country.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_299" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_652">Whatever combination of solutions is devised, it is essential that both knowledge and physical resources are developed to ensure records and other cultural objects in digital form can be preserved. As the Deputy stated, as a first step in a more substantial programme of work, I appointed a member of staff of the National Archives to examine the issue of electronic records. Progress has been made in the development of an electronic records unit within the National Archives. The development of strategies for the long-term preservation of electronic records covered by the National Archives Act 1986 and for drafting guidelines for the management of electronic records to ensure their survival as archives continues. Unfortunately that programme has been interrupted by the resignation of the recently appointed specialist member of staff. We are actively engaged with the Public Appointments Commission to have this specialist vacancy filled. I hope we can do so in the short to medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">Once the vacancy has been filled work will recommence on developing a strategy for the long-term preservation of electronic records. Further initiatives to increase the skill base in the National Archives are being pursued to ensure that all Departments and Government offices will be provided with best practice guidelines for the maintenance of electronic records.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">It is difficult to give an estimate of the timescale to Deputy Murphy nor can I provide a meaningful estimate of the cost involved. The current premises at Bishop Street are entirely inadequate. A new premises is required, whether refurbished at that location or moved to another location, such as Parnell Square. These matters are being studied at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">There is a vibrant chair and board of the National Archives. Over the past few years various proposals have been made and the board has done an excellent job beneath the radar. We are conscious of the importance of the material concerned and anxious to ensure the survival of records in whatever format and that the format survives the test of time.</p>

            <p eId="para_659">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 17 and 20 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">An inter-agency steering group comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Finance, in addition to representatives of the Irish Sports Council, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited and the County and City Managers' Association has been established to oversee the development of a sports facilities strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">One of the first tasks to be addressed by the group has been to define the scope of the proposed audit of sports facilities. In doing so it consulted with the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, which has recently completed work on its own audit of facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">It has been decided to divide the work into two distinct phases, initially concentrating on the establishment of a comprehensive database of national and regional sports facilities with the second phase focusing on sports facilities at local level. This approach is based on an immediate need to assemble data on existing key strategic facilities which is vital to the formation of an effective long-term strategy. This element of the overall project will be supervised by a sub-group which will be assisted in its work by a representative from the Central Statistics Office experienced in data collection and questionnaire design.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">It is likely therefore that obtaining information on sports facilities located at third level educational facilities will form part of the first phase while information on sports facilities located at post-primary schools will form part of the second phase of the audit. While it will be a challenging task to carry out such a comprehensive exercise, it will be of enormous value in establishing the level of need that still exists in the sports sector and in helping to determine future priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_666">Carrying out an effective and comprehensive national audit of local facilities is a major undertaking in respect of complexity and time. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland embarked on a similar exercise in recent years and it took two to three years to complete the task. In total 1,900 individual sites were identified containing some 10,000 sports facilities. In the past seven years in this jurisdiction we have invested €386 million in almost 5,000 facilities. Many facilities existed before that, although there were not as many as we would wish. This audit will take time and although we will put resources into carrying this out it would be foolish to think it can be done overnight.</p>

          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_304">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_670">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue. The HSE western area has decided to abolish the payment of enhanced subvention for nursing home residents due to funding shortfalls. This is an unacceptable cutback. Although 117 people in Mayo in receipt of enhanced subvention will continue to receive it, anyone else without independent means requiring a nursing home place will no longer be able to afford it. In the case of a rock bottom nursing home tab of €450 per week a funding shortfall of €100 per week will exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">Cutbacks of some 100 beds have been made in Mayo in recent years. As the State is unable to provide sufficient public residential beds, older people will occupy even more acute hospital beds for longer periods because there is nowhere else for them to go. This will worsen the trolley chaos that already exists. The entire subvention scheme is unacceptable and is in disarray.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">Nationally there is disparity between amounts payable for a nursing home place. For enhanced subvention the maximum amounts payable, after subvention and pension payments, range from €680 or more in the east of Ireland to €30 in the mid-west. This range across the country is unacceptable, especially in respect of the new HSE set-up where so much uniformity had been promised. Older people need some certainty on the funding available so that plans can be made. If nursing home places are needed there must be certainty on availability of places.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">I urge the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to address the chaos that exists by providing the necessary funding to the HSE to restore enhanced subvention payments. The HSE does not receive a designated budget to make these payments. In recent years services had to be cut back in order to make these payments. Our older people deserve better than to be subjected to this additional trauma.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">Enhanced subvention exists for people who have nothing else. Means testing has proved that these people have nothing, no money except the pension, no land, no property and no relatives with money. If relatives exist they do not have money and the old people are totally impoverished. These people are at the mercy of the State and it is letting them down and I regard this as another cutback. In the HSE western area the maximum subvention is €220 per week and once a pension is added to this there remains a funding shortfall of €100. Enhanced subvention is a necessary top-up for those people. Otherwise, where can they go? They will end up occupying a hospital bed. If the State does not pay this top-up for them, they will be unable to afford a nursing home place and will continue to occupy that hospital bed, thereby unwittingly depriving someone with an acute condition of that bed. A person will be on a trolley downstairs in a hospital because the bed upstairs is occupied by an older person who would prefer to be in a nursing home.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this matter on the Adjournment. On behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, I wish to outline to the House the current position regarding enhanced subvention in the western area.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">Deputy Cowley and all Members of the House will be aware that the nursing home subvention may be paid towards the cost of private nursing home care where a person is unable to meet the cost or where he or she has been assessed as needing nursing home care by the Health Service Executive and where the person has satisfied a means test. The amount of subvention will depend on the degree of nursing home care required, that is, medium, high, maximum, and the amount of the person's assets including property, stocks and shares, savings etc. The rates of subvention payable are as follows: for medium dependency there is a payment of €114.30 per week; for high dependency the payment is €152.40 per week; and the amount for maximum dependency is €190.50.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home charges and was not intended to cover the entire cost of nursing home care. However, I am very aware that the gap between the rates of subvention being paid and nursing home costs has widened considerably in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">The Health Service Executive may, in accordance with article 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention)(Amendment) Regulations 1996, pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions, however, is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates mentioned above. Spending on the nursing home subvention scheme has increased from €5 million in 1993, when it was introduced, to a figure in the region of €140 million this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">When a person applies for a subvention it is subject to a means test and a person's assets are taken into account, but the test currently being used is very much in need of a change. If person's house is valued at more than €95,000, it would rule him or her out but one would have to travel a good distance before one would find a house worth less than that. When one considers that the average price of a second-hand house in Dublin is close to €400,000, it gives some indication of the necessity to change the guidelines. We will be announcing changes in that regard in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_681">The Department has been informed by the HSE that the position in the western area is that every person in receipt of nursing home subvention and enhanced nursing home subvention is being paid and will continue to be paid. There is a heavy demand for enhanced nursing home subvention. Each individual application for enhanced nursing home subvention will be reviewed by the local health office manager in each county in the HSE western area and each case will be considered individually. Also, as part of the 2006 Estimates process, proposals have been put forward by the HSE for additional funding for the western area.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs has been established. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O'Shea. This group is expected to report to the Tánaiste and to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs in the very near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_683">The next item is in the names of Deputies O'Connor and Crowe. The Deputies have five minutes each.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_307">
            <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
            <p eId="para_684">I acknowledge sincerely the co-operation of the Ceann Comhairle's office in allowing Deputy Crowe and I to raise an issue of serious concern to our community in Tallaght, where we live in the same estate. My son Robert made the point to me today that it is interesting to listen to Dáil proceedings when, as was the case this afternoon, we speak about issues such as the children of Pakistan, about whom much concern was expressed. The issue I want to raise is important for my constituency, and I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power. It is also nice to see one of the Fianna Fáil vice-presidents, Michael Stokes, in the Visitors Gallery.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">Tallaght west is an amazingly positive place which has been the subject of occasional bad publicity and a bad reputation over the years. Those of us who are honoured to represent the Tallaght west estates are anxious to paint a positive picture of the great communities of Jobstown, Fettercairn, Brookfield and Killinarden. My party leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, made the point when he visited Jobstown on Monday last that he has visited Tallaght west on a number of occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">There is no doubt that much progress has been made recently in the community, which is only right. We now have in place a number of projects that we were waiting on for a long time. They include the building of the swimming pool in Jobstown, which is exciting everybody in the community, a new community centre in Brookfield and the need for a youth centre in Jobstown. Also, during the summer the Taoiseach opened the Citywise education project in Jobstown.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">There is no question that the progress made on resources, facilities and infrastructure for the Tallaght west estates is only what the people deserve. I have always supported and been committed to a strong social inclusion policy for those Tallaght estates, which clearly need that assistance. In doing so I am following the example of my colleague, the former Minister of State, Chris Flood, who is also a long time colleague of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and who strongly represented the Tallaght west area.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">The initiative Deputy Crowe and I raise concerns a report, A Place for Children: Tallaght West, a living document, which is the result of a ten-year approach by the Childhood Development Initiative whose consortium includes An Cosán, Barnardos, Brookfield Headstart pre-school and crèche, the Health Service Executive, Integration of African Children in Ireland, the Jobstown child care centre, Killinarden school completion programme, Little Scholar's pre-school in Jobstown, the Rainbow House early education and child care centre, Scoil Chaitlín Maude and Naíonra Chaitlín Maude, Scoil Cnoc Mhuire in Knockmore, South Dublin County Council, the south Dublin child care committee, St. Aidan's and St. Bridget's national schools in Brookfield, St. Aidan's Traveller centre in Brookfield, St. Anne's primary school in Fettercairn, St. Louise's playgroup in Knockmore, St. Thomas's senior school in Jobstown, Tallaght Partnership, West Tallaght RAPID, the YMCA and Youth Horizons. That list is an indication of the importance of this child care initiative. We were all delighted to join the Taoiseach on Monday in a tent in the grounds of Kiltalown House near Jobstown. The event was attended by more than 900 children and some 400 adults. It was an amazing experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">I said in an earlier debate that when I visited a local school last week, a youngster told me that road safety is not just for one day or one week but forever. It is important that we get the message across that it is not just about a launch or making a point on a day but asking Government to examine this serious report, which not only would be good for the Tallaght west estates but could be used as a model for the rest of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">I appeal to the Minister of State to get the message across to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children and her colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that it would be worth their while examining this report and taking action on it. As a Tallaght-based Fianna Fáil Deputy, I make a special appeal to the Minister of State to do what he can to help us ensure this report is resourced, which would give a tremendous boost to the Tallaght west estates. It would give the children of Tallaght west a great future. I make a special appeal to the Minister of State to help us in that regard.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_308">
            <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_691">Like my colleague I welcome the opportunity to speak on the question I have put to the Minister for Health and Children. It is clear from the statistics for Tallaght west that it is a unique area with special needs. The area was officially designated decades ago as a County Dublin Areas of Need, CODAN, area in recognition of the difficulties there, and is now a RAPID area. It has not received the investment and support mechanisms the people in this area deserve and to which they are entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">Unemployment in the area is two to three times the national average. The population aged under 15 is 39%, whereas the national average is 24%. Almost one third of all families in the area are headed by a lone parent, twice the national average. A total of 54% of the adult population in Tallaght west left education at or before the age of 15.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">Only 6.8% of the population is in full-time education after the age of 20, which is less than half the national average. The area has suffered unacceptable levels of anti-social behaviour, criminality and its negative spin-offs. Over 600 people from the area are in treatment for substance abuse — this is only the tip of the iceberg because studies suggest the real level of substance abuse is three times higher.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">This Government and previous Governments should have pursued a strategy for the area in light of the statistics I have outlined. The childhood development initiative has done that with the strategy it launched earlier this week, A Place for Children: Tallaght West, a living document This is described as a living document and hopefully will get the response it deserves. It proposes intervention at the earliest possible stage with a view to preventing a child falling by the wayside.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">The initiative has six targets, namely, to improve early childhood care and education radically; to co-ordinate the integration of services in schools and child and family centres with a view to increasing efficiency; to develop new services where needed; to liaise with current services; to reduce stresses on parents and children; and to evaluate and apply what is learned on a national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">This is designed to have a major impact on this Government's targets for reducing child poverty, increasing child care places, reducing educational disadvantage and drop-out rates, and reducing anti-social behaviour. It also includes the aspiration to build an inclusive and more equal society where no child goes to bed cold, hungry or frightened and children in this area receive the same opportunities as the well-off children from middle Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">What practical steps do the Minister of State and his Government intend to take in support of this initiative? Will he and his Department invest the extra €634 per child for three years as called for by this strategy? The strategy involves expenditure of €15 million over a ten year period. That is small change in the context of the amount of money taken into the economy this year, including the unexpected extra €1 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">If the Minister of State takes into account the problems I outlined at the start of this debate and the difficulties facing people in the area, he will see there is need for a proper response from Government. Not only this Government but successive Governments have failed the people in this area. We are trying to create a new place for children that will offer them new opportunities to break out of the cycle of poverty and structured inequality. This requires investment and joined-up Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">I applaud the people who came together in this initiative which should have come from the Government but instead came from the community. I appeal to the Minister of State to support this positive initiative from the people of Tallaght west.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_309" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_700">On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, I wish to respond to the issue raised by Deputies O'Connor and Crowe. It is nice to see constituency colleagues working together. This provides me with an opportunity to outline to this House our response to the launch of this ten year child care strategy for Tallaght west. The objective of the strategy, as the Deputies have outlined, is to improve children's health, safety, learning and achieving, and to increase their sense of community belonging. I welcome its goals and its aims.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">At the research stage of this project, my colleague, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, made some funding available to ensure that the valuable research continued. Given the research, planning and consultation, including consultation with children, that has gone into this project, it is clear that the strategy is based on a realistic picture of life for children in Tallaght west. It emphasises the need for co-operation across Departments and agencies, together with similar assistance and understanding from the local community and the local authority, South Dublin County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">The Taoiseach, in launching the ten year strategy, entitled A Place for Children: Tallaght West, a living document, on Monday last indicated that it points in the right directions. Despite the real progress that has been made in Ireland in recent years with increased investment, spending and planning, many children continue to experience poverty and disadvantage in their daily lives. The problems which lie behind this poverty and disadvantage are often complex and do not lend themselves to simple solutions. To address these problems, social policy must be based on a strategic approach and must target those in need. The Government has put a number of initiatives in place with the aim of improving children's lives, some of which I will outline.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">As a Government designated geographic area of disadvantage, or RAPID area, it has been estimated that approximately €27 million was spent in 2004-05 by statutory bodies on children's services in the part of Tallaght covered by the strategy. The project recognises this, which is a substantial sum in the area concerned. The National Children's Office is in place to co-ordinate the implementation of the children's strategy, including consultation with children, and hearing their voices. The Ombudsman for Children provides an independent voice on their behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">Ireland is one of the first countries in the world to have a national policy on play, Ready, Steady, Play, which was launched by my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The Government wants to build more playgrounds and parks with spaces to play and to make playgrounds and play areas safer for children. Part of this can be done through direct provision from the Exchequer and part by good forward planning on the part of local authorities. The Government has put funding in place. In Tallaght west, grants of €72,000 each have been provided to Jobstown, Fettercairn and Killinarden for playgrounds under the RAPID scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">The provision of early childhood care and education services is identified as central to positive outcomes for children. The Government is reviewing options for future child care policy, taking account of the work of the high level working group on early childhood care and education and other reports on the issue. The National Children's Office was asked to prepare the high level working group report which was presented to the Cabinet Committee on Children last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">Funding of over €10.6 million under the equal opportunities child care programme has been allocated to the Tallaght-Jobstown area since the beginning of the programme. School age child care is being addressed under the equal opportunities child care programme as well, under an initiative announced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, earlier this summer. The Health Service Executive is also involved in developing and supporting a number of child care and family support services in the Tallaght area and is represented on this project's consortium group.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">Education is the key to young people reaching their full potential. It can provide them with the confidence to participate actively in society. Tackling educational disadvantage continues to be a key priority for the Government as reflected in the new action plan on educational disadvantage, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, launched by my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, last May. The new action plan aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed in a more targeted, coherent and integrated way.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">Another priority for the Government is reform of the youth justice system. Young people are subject to many pressures. Drugs, alcohol and social disadvantage can lead to a cycle of poverty, anti-social behaviour and getting into trouble. The Government is working to identify those at risk as early as possible and build their capacity to become responsible citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The Children Act 2001 provides us with unique and specific opportunities. Major principles enshrined in the Act include the need for early intervention, the provision of community alternatives to detention and the principle that custody must remain a measure of last resort. A review of the structures of our youth justice system is being finalised and the results will be brought to the Government shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">Those developments at national level are mirrored in the approach outlined in the childhood development initiative's ten-year strategy. The strategy will support steps already being taken to improve outcomes for children in this area and play an active role in seeking new solutions to emerging issues. As the Taoiseach stated at the launch, the strategy and its proposals will be considered by relevant officials from the Departments drawing on the involvement of many local agencies in its preparation.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_310">
            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_711">I wish to raise the issue of the disabled persons' grant, the inequality in how it is provided nationally, and what I believe must happen to resolve that. It must be attached to the initiative that the Tánaiste announced last week, which is very welcome, regarding incentivising people to stay well at home instead of entering a nursing home.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">One aspect is the provision of something like the disabled persons grant or the essential repairs grant, the two being interlinked. They are two thirds funded by the Exchequer, with one third coming from the local authority, which is really the Exchequer too. Meeting the demands sought very much depends on whether one's local authority can produce the missing third. I have produced a table per head of the population. The lowest amount paid per head is in Kildare, some €7.35 for every person in the county. That understates the situation since there has been very rapid population growth there and the figures do not include people who have not yet been counted in the census of population. At the other end of the spectrum is Leitrim which receives €100.72 per head for this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">I know that one cannot take one fund in isolation and that one should consider the totality. However, if one telephones the local authorities at the bottom of the list, one typically hears that they have a problem in meeting the demands of people applying. That is certainly the case in Kildare where applications total €5.5 million, with €1.5 million necessary to meet them. That is having a real and definite impact on people. It is certainly having the opposite result to that which the Tánaiste sought in the home care programme that she launched last week. It is not only disproportionate. Some of the disability groups tell us that money is returned from some local authorities where it is not used.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">If we can see a problem like that and the money is in a fund, we must consider the structural reason that the problem occurs in the first place, which is that the local authorities at the end of the funding stream find it impossible to produce the one third required of them tomeet the demands of people living in those counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">I have encountered situations such as that of a couple where the man had retired to care for his wife who suffered from motor neurone disease, which is progressive. He was trying to keep her at home for as long as possible and maintain a high quality of life for her despite the degenerative illness. The disabled persons grant list was closed and even to install a ramp proved impossible for that couple. Such things should not happen in this day and age. People are not able to modify bathrooms to have a safer walk-in shower fitted. Those are typical of applications returned to people in Kildare who are told that they are not disabled enough and that they must be utterly disabled to qualify for funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">It is really not fair that in one part of the country one can have that funded through a grant while in another one cannot because one's local authority cannot produce the missing third. The sorts of choices that must be made regarding the one third include not introducing traffic calming or augmenting water treatment systems. This scheme is competing with so many other necessary schemes that it should be nationally funded and locally administered. That is the only way to overcome the difficulty. The funding exists but is inappropriately dispersed throughout the country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_311" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_717">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I wish to reply on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing and urban renewal.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">The disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes serve a very useful purpose in helping to meet the housing needs of disabled and older persons. The disabled persons grant is available for the provision of additional accommodation or the carrying out of works of adaptation which, in the opinion of the local authority in whose area a house is located, are reasonably necessary to make the house more suitable for a disabled member of the household.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">The essential repairs grant enables people in houses that cannot be made habitable in all respects at a reasonable cost to have basic repairs carried out to them. The scheme is directed primarily at older persons living in poor housing conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">I wish to make clear the Government's commitment to those schemes. They assist some of the more vulnerable sectors of society in providing themselves with accommodation appropriate to their changing needs. We have not been found lacking regarding the schemes. Demand for assistance under the disabled persons grant scheme, in particular, has increased enormously, and that is due in no small part to the significant improvements the Government has made to the scheme in recent years. In particular, the increase of the maximum effective grant in 2001 to its present level of €20,320, and the increase in the percentage of cost payable to 90%, has led to significantly greater activity under the scheme. The position is similar regarding the essential repairs grant scheme. The effective maximum grant of €9,523 may cover up to 100% of the cost of the works.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">To meet that increased demand, the capital provision for the schemes is €70 million this year. The number of disabled persons grants paid increased from 3,646 in 2000 to 5,222 last year. Expenditure in the same period totalled more than €218 million, with more than 25,400 grants paid. That means that 25,400 projects were completed, allowing that number of disabled persons to remain in their home and enjoy improved housing conditions that many of them would otherwise have been unable to afford. Expenditure on the essential repairs grant scheme totalled €53 million in the period from 2000 to 2004, with 11,400 grants paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">Deputies will be aware that the management of both schemes is delegated to local authorities within the framework laid down in statutory regulations. As far as practicable, that is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility at local level. The fact that the current regulations are framed in a manner that allows authorities maximum flexibility is one of the strengths of the scheme, but it may also require more active management at local level. The majority of authorities have reviewed their schemes in recent years to streamline their operations and reduce as far as possible the bureaucracy that might arise where more than one statutory agency is involved. They have also introduced a variety of mechanisms to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need, including prioritisation on medical grounds, financial ability to carry out the work and unit cost control.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">It is a matter for the authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the schemes in their areas from within the combined allocations notified to them for that purpose by the Department. As I said, a combined capital allocation of €70 million is being made available to local authorities for the payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants in 2005. Individual allocations have been notified to local authorities based on their requirements as notified to the Department. It is a matter for authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the two schemes from within that combined capital allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">While two thirds of all expenditure on the schemes is recouped by my Department, authorities are required to fund the remaining one third from their own revenue resources, with amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates. In an effort to make the scheme more manageable for authorities, the recoupment level was increased from 50% to two thirds with effect from 2001. I am aware that some local authorities appear to give these schemes greater priority than others in the framing of their estimates. In the case of authorities with a high level of demand for the schemes, the provision of a one-third contribution can be a challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">When notified of their combined capital allocation for the scheme in 2005, local authorities were advised that in any cases where they had not made provision in their 2005 budget for their net contribution to these grants, they should advise the Department without delay of their proposals for the funding of their contribution. Any such applications are being considered in the Department. While there are no proposals to remove the requirement to provide a contribution from their revenue resources, this aspect of the scheme is also being considered in the context of the review of the scheme which is being finalised in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">The disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes are intended, like a number of other housing grant schemes operated by my Department, to assist works which provide additional or adapted accommodation in private houses. However, they are not designed to cover the full cost of works for all applicants. Local authorities may provide reconstruction loans to qualified applicants who have difficulty in obtaining finance to meet the balance of the cost. The focussing of the scheme on real needs, both financial and in terms of accommodation, and its operation by local authorities in an efficient manner will be critical in ensuring that it achieves its aim. I hope the outcome of the review of the operation of the scheme which is under way in my Department will significantly contribute to this achievement.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">I am aware of Deputy Catherine Murphy's interest in this issue. We have both been critical in the past of how this issue has been dealt with in Kildare. When comparing counties, such as Kildare and Leitrim, as Deputy Catherine Murphy did, in terms of the funding allocated, there are other considerations one must take on board, including the average age of the houses involved and the percentage of the population who seek assistance in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">The ACCESS scheme, which commenced in 2001, provided grants of €45.71 million for the development of 44 arts and cultural facilities around the country. This scheme has transformed the level of access to arts and cultural activities for a great many people in all parts of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">Since assuming responsibility for the arts, I have consistently said that the arts are for all and that artistic expression is a key element of a balanced society. The ACCESS scheme has contributed significantly to bringing arts and culture to the people, and accordingly there is a strong case for a successor scheme to ACCESS, which I am now pursuing. I hope to be able shortly to clarify the position regarding a possible successor to the current ACCESS scheme. Pending conclusion, however, of the Estimates process, we cannot finalise what the form or extent of such a scheme might be. Applications for any such successor scheme would be invited by public advertisement.</p>

            <p eId="para_734">Since I announced the appointment of the design and project management teams for the Lansdowne Road Stadium project in April this year, work on developing the conceptual design for the new stadium has been proceeding at full speed. The design for the new Lansdowne Stadium is now completed and I will be launching the new detailed design on Monday, 17 October. There has been no delay to the project and the project is meeting all the target schedule dates set for it. Now that the detailed project design has been completed, it is expected that a planning application for the project will be lodged by the end of 2005. It is not possible, at this stage, to gauge exactly how long it may take to secure full planning permission. However, in anticipation of an early and favourable outcome to the planning application, I expect that construction work on the stadium would begin during 2007. The period of construction is projected to be 29 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has committed €191 million towards the cost of the project with the balance being provided by the IRFU and FAI. It has been agreed that the Exchequer funding will be front-loaded in the development of the project and this will become operational again once certain necessary procedural arrangements, which are the subject of consultations between the Department and the sporting bodies, are put in place.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_314">
            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_737">I had the privilege last week of officially launching the ESRI Report, Social and Economic Value of Sport in Ireland, a research project which was also undertaken as part of the Irish Sports Council's research programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">This report makes a major contribution to the future development of Irish sports policy. While previous studies and our own experiences attest to the significant role of sport in the social and economic life of our country, this major report addresses a vital gap in our knowledge in terms of measuring the impact and importance of sport in Ireland. It makes a most persuasive case for the contribution of sport to Irish society.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">It is worth pointing out that Irish sports policy, its funding and its programmes have always been firmly grounded on the fundamental principle that sport belongs to the community and to the citizen. Government support for sport is predicated on the need for tolerance, mutual respect, fair play and equal access for everybody. Sports policy and funding helps to foster the social and health benefits to both the individual and to society in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The ESRI report estimates that the social aspects of sport have an economic value of €1.4 billion. The report concludes that sport is a major contributor to social capital in Ireland today. This is largely based on the volunteer contribution to sport, with three people engaged in support activities for every four actively participating. It is striking that 400,000 people, or 15% of the population, should offer their services in a voluntary way to sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">The Irish Sports Council, consistent with its statutory remit, has placed strong emphasis on undertaking a comprehensive programme of research. This essential and valuable work will increase our understanding of the shape and dynamics of sport in Ireland and I look forward to the next phase, with the Children's Participation research to be published later this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">I am confident that, given the level of investment and commitment to sport by the Government, Irish sport will do even better in the future. The Government's budget for sport this year is over €149 million, as compared with the amount of just €17.4 million in 1997. This hugely increased investment in sport and recreation has resulted in a considerably enhanced range and quality of programmes and top class facilities from national level to local community centres, clubs and public facilities throughout the country. We are already beginning to see the benefits of this phenomenal increase in new investment in sport and we will continue to reap the benefits as time goes on.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">The sports capital grant scheme operated by my Department has a major impact on the delivery of sport in every corner of the country, providing the facilities that allow programmes and activities take place that will bring and keep young people in sport. Crucially, the funding allocated provides essential support and encouragement to the thousands of volunteers involved in sport throughout the country. The programme has, since 1998, allocated funding of €386 million to 4,897 projects to provide badly needed facilities and equipment in virtually every parish, village, town and city, ranging from community centres and facilities for small local clubs in every sport to national sports centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">A review of sports capital programme expenditure for the period 1999 to 2002 recently completed by the Department has shown that the sports capital programme has been a powerful catalyst in building sporting and community infrastructure, demonstrating the benefits of increased funding in recent years to sport in local communities all over the country. It shows that every €1 of Government expenditure has supported the equivalent of an additional €2.7 corresponding investment by sports clubs, community groups, schools, college and local authorities. Bringing this ratio up to date indicates that total sports capital programme expenditure between 1999 and 2005 of €316 million is supporting a total investment of almost €1.2 billion in sports and community facilities in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">The budget for the Irish Sports Council has increased from €13.2 million in 2000, its first full year of operation, to €34.4 million in 2005. This level of funding is enabling the council to support a wide range of programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing the involvement of people of all ages in sport and promoting social cohesion and enhanced community involvement in all aspects of sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">The results of the ESRI research make a persuasive case for acknowledging the unique contribution of sport to our sense of national well-being. I welcome its publication.</p>

            <p eId="para_748">For 50 years the Wexford Festival Opera, WFO, has been a key event in the cultural life of Ireland and has won extensive international acclaim. Founded in 1951, the WFO specialise in discovering neglected opera pieces. It runs each October and produces three major operas at the Theatre Royal. The existing Theatre Royal is unsuitable for use by the festival into the future. Accordingly, the Wexford Festival Opera proposes to carry out a major redevelopment of the theatre. To this end over the past number of years it has been acquiring sites around the theatre to allow redevelopment to go ahead and now has the space necessary for redevelopment. Design work for the redevelopment has been carried out by OPW and planning permission is in place, and the OPW has agreed to take the project to tender stage on its behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">I believe that this is a worthwhile development, of immense importance to the cultural life of Ireland and of very particular significance to Wexford and its hinterland. The availability of Exchequer co-funding for the construction phase of this project in under active consideration in the context of the 2006-10 capital envelopes. In that context, it is helpful that progress is being made by the festival in securing commitments to matching private investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">On a personal level, I take this opportunity to pay tribute once again to the recently deceased chief executive of the Wexford Festival Opera and deputy chair of the Arts Council, Mr. Jerome Hynes. Jerome's personal drive and determination were in large part responsible for bringing this development to the stage to where it has now advanced. He is an immense loss to his family and friends, to Wexford and to the arts in all of Ireland. Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided in 2004 to proceed, as financial resources permit, with the development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, having consulted widely with the major governing bodies of sport, stakeholders and interest groups, put forward proposals for the development of a sports campus. This development control plan represents phase one of a wider programme for sports facilities. It proposes the development of pitches and ancillary accommodation catering mainly for the three major field sports, rugby, soccer and Gaelic games, as well as an indoor sports centre to cater for a range of indoor sports with spectator accommodation and also includes publicly accessible all weather floodlit synthetic pitches. Over 30 sports can be accommodated in the proposed indoor sports centre. They include indoor hockey, hurling, tennis, gymnastics, badminton, basketball, martial arts, bowls and boxing.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">This phase of the programme has been costed at €118 million and will have a four or five year delivery schedule. There has been no capital expenditure on the sports campus project in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">The Government has had an initial discussion on the proposal at the Cabinet meeting of 7 September and directed that further analysis be carried out by the Office of Public Works to facilitate the delivery of the project. I expect to bring the outcome of this investigative work to Government shortly. In the meantime, the funding which would lead to a commencement of the project is currently being considered in the context of the multi-annual capital envelope for my Department, which will be agreed prior to the budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">My Department administers the local authority swimming pool programme, which provides grant aid towards the capital costs of a new pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs — 90% in the case of disadvantaged areas — subject to a maximum of €3.8 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">Since 2002, grant aid has been approved for 17 swimming pool projects. Of these, nine projects have been completed and are open. They are located in Finglas in Dublin where the project involved a replacement; in Ballinasloe where it involved a replacement; in the Aquadome in Tralee where it involved a refurbishment; in the Regional Sports and Leisure Centre in Tralee where it involved refurbishment; in the Grove Island in Limerick where it involved a new pool; in Clonmel where it involved refurbishment; in Churchfield in Cork city where it involved refurbishment; in Ballymun in Dublin where it involved a replacement; and in Tuam where it involved a replacement. The remaining eight pools, in Ballyfermot in Dublin involving a replacement, in Cobh involving a replacement, in Youghal involving a new pool, in Drogheda involving a replacement, in Jobstown in south county Dublin involving a new pool, in Letterkenny involving a replacement, in Monaghan town involving a replacement, and in Ballybunion involving a new pool, are under construction or due to start construction shortly.</p>

However, my Department is carrying out an expenditure review of the programme, which is examining, among other things, how it has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built under the programme and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. This review is expected to be completed by year end. On completion of this review, the question of re-opening the programme can be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_776">The current round of the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, was closed to applications on 31 July 2000. The priority in relation to the programme is to support the 55 projects that applied for funding and applications for grant aid towards the construction of swimming pools are not being considered at this time. However, my Department is carrying out an expenditure review of the programme, which is examining, among other things, how it has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built under the programme and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. This review is expected to be completed by year end. On completion of this review, the question of re-opening the programme can be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">The current programme provides for a maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs — 90% in the case of disadvantaged areas — subject to a maximum of €3.8 million. To avail of the grant the local authority must provide the balance of the financing either directly or a combination of local authority funding, community group financing etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">It is important to bear in mind that the local authority swimming pool programme is merely a grant scheme and it is a matter for local authorities to devise funding and operational arrangements, as they see fit, in relation to the provision of swimming facilities in their areas. Experience shows that there is potential for private sector involvement in the provision and operation of local authority swimming pool facilities and many local authorities are exploring various ways of involving the private sector in their projects. From my Department's perspective, there is no objection to the involvement of the private sector provided the generally accepted operational considerations of a public pool form part of the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_782">Funding available to Cork 2005 includes funding from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for €7.85 million, comprising an original €6.35 million towards programming for the event and a further €1.5 million for additional new commissions and several big events with mass audience appeal. There is also EU funding of €0.5 million; Cork City Council funding of €5.75 million; sponsorship of €2.56 million, a further €600,000 has been underwritten by Cork City Council; Health Service Executive funding of €0.31 million; and other miscellaneous income of €0.10 million.

            <p eId="para_783">Over 730,000 people attended official Cork 2005 events during the first six months of the year. This record attendance at events in the first half of 2005 is indicative of the great response to the Cork 2005 programme from local and from international audiences. The major cultural venues in Cork are indicating increased audience numbers in the region of 33%. The city's cultural sector has also been enabled to extend its programming reach to other national and international companies and have also been enabled to commission new works to premier in Cork in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">The city is enjoying the economic as well as the cultural benefits of the European Capital of Culture designation. Cork Airport is experiencing record growth this year, with half yearly figures up 15.9% on the same period last year. There has also been a significant increase in hotel occupancy rates and this trend is expected to continue until the end of the year. It has been widely acknowledged that the Capital of Culture designation is a contributing factor in this significant growth.</p>

            <p eId="para_790">Responsibility for marketing the island of Ireland in all overseas markets, including the British market, rests with Tourism Ireland. While 2004 saw overseas visitor numbers grow to a record 6.4 million, the British market, which accounts for 58% of our visitors, declined by 1%, following more than a decade of sustained growth. The softness of the market can be put down to a combination of factors including competition growing faster than the pool of travellers. Europe as a whole is losing market share to new centres in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Other factors include eastern European states gaining market share to the detriment of other European destinations. Low cost access to these and other destinations, coupled with low prices in eastern Europe, have proved very attractive to British holidaymakers. Surveys show that British tourists, in common with others, are increasingly price sensitive when making holiday decisions. On a more general note, consumer behaviour is changing, as is the type and duration of holiday-taking. The whole process of reaching potential customers and how they choose and buy their holidays is undergoing dramatic change in the British and in other markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">In conjunction with industry leaders, Tourism Ireland, has undertaken a root and branch review of the British market. The review identified the reasons for changes in British consumer behaviour and the responses needed by the industry to secure sustainable growth from the market. The review emphasised the urgent need to re-think how the Ireland holiday offer is presented and experienced — whether this means developing new takes on existing products, developing new ways of reaching the target audience or making sure that those who travel here experience a holiday that is simply not available anywhere else in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">As a result, a new strategy for Britain was developed and launched last April and is now being implemented. While CSO figures for the first seven months of the year show an increase in the number of British visitors of about 2%, these figures do not necessarily give ground for complacency. In line with Government policy, Tourism Ireland is also seeking to broaden Ireland's source markets and has focused particularly on mainland Europe. Up to July of this year, mainland European visit numbers were up over 19%.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">Our new strategy for Britain is certainly a strong platform for growing business from this market which many consider the most competitive in the world. However, this year has seen Britain face some challenges on the economic and security fronts and these may mean a more challenging scenario for the Irish tourism sector in attempting to grow business there.</p>

            <p eId="para_796">The new governance structure will include a board of 11 members, the mechanisms for the appointment of which are designed to ensure the skills needed to run a modern theatre are included. The new board structure is complemented by a far-reaching change management process.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">I have already named the chairperson of the new Abbey Theatre and the two other members which it is my responsibility to nominate. They are Judge Bryan McMahon, as chair, Suzanne Kelly and Tom Hickey, as board director. Together these nominees bring a mix of governance, legal, accounting, business and artistic skills to the new board. A selection committee consisting of Judge McMahon, Ms Olive Braiden, chair of the Arts Council and Mr. John Farleigh, a member of the outgoing Abbey Advisory Council, has been put in place to recommend the remaining eight members of the board. The work of the committee should be completed before Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">State funding for the Abbey is provided by the Arts Council, and the conditions attached to the council's financial inputs are a matter for discussion between the Abbey and the council. Ongoing support by the council is correctly conditional on implementation and completion of the change management process at the Abbey Theatre.</p>

An inspection was carried out by a team led by Rohcon, and including S&amp;P Architects, URS Structural Engineers, Euro Pools specialist subcontractors. Davis Langdon PKS, Project Managers and Kavanagh Mansfield &amp; Partners, Consulting Structural and Civil engineers represented CSID at the inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">The inspection team conducted a technical examination of the entire centre with particular reference to the structural integrity of the concrete works. Rohcon found there was no evidence of any structural defects or of any water leaking into the plant room as had been alleged in the media. Rohcon found some leakage through pipe joints and valves which in its view were operational matters. In addition, a test was carried out and confirmed that there were no leaks from the swimming pools. URS Structural Engineers confirmed that the concrete works were designed and constructed to meet the British standard 8007. It confirmed that any cracks that existed were not leaking, were not of a structural nature and were entirely normal for a building of this type. Rohcon published the results of its findings on 7 July. CSID received a separate report from its own structural engineers, Kavanagh Mansfield &amp; Partners, which supported the Rohcon findings.</p>

            <p eId="para_807">Horse Racing Ireland has a long-standing relationship with Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in jointly promoting Ireland as a destination for racing tourism. Horse Racing Ireland estimates approximately 60,000 UK visitors come racing here each year and the three agencies consider that there is substantial potential for growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">Following requests from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to explore possible synergies between the agencies, Horse Racing Ireland specifically identified the Punchestown Festival as an attractive option to grow inbound racing tourism. Discussions between Horse Racing Ireland and the tourism agencies are well under way to explore and develop this option.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">Punchestown has a number of clear advantages. It already attracts some 7,000 UK visitors who tend to regard Punchestown as the second Cheltenham and a chance to renew the friendly Anglo-Irish rivalry on the racetrack. It features the top horses, jockeys and trainers from both countries. The two events combined represent the pinnacle of national hunt racing in these islands. Recent Irish successes at Cheltenham's Festival, a record nine winners in 2005, ensures Irish racing is held in the highest regard in Britain. Irish racing has a real price advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> UK racing. In 2005, the reserved enclosure Cheltenham Festival ticket costs approximately £60 per day whilethe Punchestown equivalent costs just €35 per day. This combined with the euro currency advantage gives exceptional value to UK racegoers.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">Punchestown's timing in late April is ideal for early season tourism. It drives tourism into County Kildare while benefiting from Dublin's infrastructure. Punchestown facilities are state-of-the-art and capable of accommodating significant increases in attendances. It has a first class corporate package which attracts many blue-chip British companies, high value business with spin-offs for hotels, car hire and golf courses. Horse Racing Ireland will increase its marketing spend on UK tourism drives by at least 50% in 2006. This, combined with Fáilte Ireland and Punchestown's own marketing plans, will mark a dedicated three-year programme to build the Punchestown Festival into a major tourist event.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_814">I appointed the Tourism Policy Review Group, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Travers, in December 2002, with a mandate to review Irish tourism performance and prospects and to identify a strategy for future sustainable development of the sector. The group concluded its task with the presentation of its report to me, New Horizons for Irish Tourism, An Agenda for Action, in September 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">To give best effect to the implementation of the tourism action plan recommended by the review group, I established an implementation group, again with Mr. Travers as the chairperson. This group has already presented two formal reports to me, in August 2004 and April 2005 and I expect to receive a third report at the end of the year. The reports are available on my Department's website, <i>www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">I gave the implementation group a brief with a specific timescale, to the end of 2005, to drive forward the two-year action plan recommended in the New Horizons document. I believe that this group should see out the task assigned to it and, in the context of its third report, consider all options for the continued effective delivery of the strategy for tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">The implementation group has identified seven issues as representing the most serious impediments to the development of Irish tourism; concerns about competitiveness and value for money, slow progress on the Ireland-US aviation arrangements, the need for additional pier and terminal facilities at Dublin Airport, changing consumer and market trends and associated loss in share of the British outbound market, the absence of a national conference centre in Dublin, uncertainty about access to the countryside and significant gaps in Dublin's cultural infrastructure. The group is monitoring these issues very closely, as it considers that progress in resolving barriers is essential if the ambitious targets set by the review group are to be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">As regards the implementation of the tourism action plan, I refer the Deputy to the April 2005 report of the implementation group and, in particular, to page 2 where it states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_819">Overall, the implementation group is satisfied that the strategy for the development of Irish tourism set out in the New Horizons report is being well advanced both by the industry itself and by Government. A preliminary analysis of the progress reported in relation to the original 76 recommendations by the review group has found that by the end of March 2005, 28 actions have been delivered, seven more have been partially delivered and good progress was reported on a further 19 and that the pace of progress is unsatisfactory in the case of some 20 actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">I look forward to receiving the group's next report.</p>

            <p eId="para_824">During the severe weather conditions experienced locally in the west Dublin area on 1 January, damage was caused to the National Aquatic Centre. The roof of the 50 metre pool and diving pool was damaged as was the roof of the leisure waters in addition to damage to lights and fittings around the complex.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">To ensure the health and safety of the users of the facility and to avoid, in so far as it is practicable and possible, a recurrence of the damage, the Office of Public Works, at the request of my Department and Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, engaged engineers to examine the damage and to provide a preliminary report as a matter of priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">Kavanagh Mansfield &amp; Partners, consulting structural and civil engineers, were commissioned to do this work. This report was independent of any other technical or professional reports prepared in relation to the centre as a result of the storm damage. Kavanagh Mansfield &amp; Partners were subsequently appointed by CSID in relation to the development and implementation of the appropriate remedial works for the storm damage and monitored the repair works carried out by Rohcon Limited, which had constructed the National Aquatic Centre. Repair works at the national aquatic centre were completed on 20 May and the centre was reopened to the public on that date. Kavanagh Mansfield &amp; Partners certified that the programme of works was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the design and secured certification from the designer's contractors and subcontractors in relation to the various elements of the works.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The costs associated with the repair and renovation of the roof are the subject of discussions between the contractors, the insurers and CSID.</p>

It also recommends that national sporting bodies with high youth participation develop a proactive strategy to find an alternative to alcohol sponsorship. I support this recommendation which is in keeping with the provisions of the Irish Sports Council's <i>Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children’s Sport in Ireland</i> which most national governing bodies of sport have signed up to.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
            <p eId="para_831">State support for the Irish film industry is directed via two principal channels, the section 481 tax-based incentive scheme for investment in film production and the Irish Film Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">The section 481 scheme will now operate until at least the end of 2008. The amount that can be raised has increased from €10.48 million to €15 million with effect from 1 January 2005. This was a very welcome development, but I am very aware that the competitive position has become less favourable for Ireland in recent times, particularly with regard to the attraction of inward international productions. This is not because of any one factor, but results from a combination of circumstances. When it was instituted, section 481 was ahead of our competitors. Other jurisdictions have, however, caught up with and, in some cases, improved on what we can offer. My analysis suggests that section 481 needs further revision, particularly with regard to big budget productions.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">Other factors are also impacting on the position. The euro to dollar exchange rate, new and enhanced competition particularly from low cost jurisdictions in eastern Europe and the perception that Ireland has become relatively more expensive all have an effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">I am in discussion with the Minister for Finance about how this competitive position might best be addressed, but I must emphasise that Government can only do so much. The industry must also constantly review its competitive position by re-evaluating what it can offer in comparison to what is available elsewhere. Only with this kind of approach can we hope to remain successful into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">The Irish Film Board is the State body under my Department's aegis which is responsible for the promotion of an indigenous film industry in Ireland, and for marketing Ireland abroad as a location for film-making.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">The report of the film industry strategic review group published in August 1999, usually referred to as the Kilkenny report, recommended that the Irish Film Board be given a more central co-ordinating role for the industry, and the board works proactively to fulfil this role. The board provides support, assistance and funding to Irish filmmakers at all levels of the business, from the neophyte who is new to the business, to those who have established themselves on the international marketplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">The board places great emphasis on its role in marketing Ireland overseas as a filmmaking location. Towards that end, the board will shortly implement a proposal of mine to appoint a resident representative in Los Angeles, to establish much closer contacts with the leading studios in their home base, to identify what is needed to secure productions for Ireland, and to work with the board and my Department in devising appropriate responses.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">My Department's funding for the board increased to €14.45 million or by almost 22% in 2005 over the 2004 figure.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">The agreement reached in 2001 by the Department of Health and Children with the general practitioner representative organisation, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, for the introduction of automatic eligibility to medical cards for people aged over 70, required GPs to have successfully graduated from an approved GP vocational training programme or to possess acquired rights as per EU Directive 93/16 and to have been in general practice for one whole year prior to 1 July, 2001. The agreement also provided that GPs holding contracts under these provisions would qualify for full general medical service, GMS contracts after five years. However, if the GP was a member of a registered partnership that was reduced to two years, provided he or she remained in the partnership for two years. Qualified GPs may apply to the Health Service Executive, HSE, for contracts to provide services to their patients who have reached 70 years and qualify for medical cards under the terms of this agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">With regard to full GMS GP contracts, these detail the terms under which contract holders provide services to medical card holders under the GMS scheme. These terms were the subject of agreement between the Department of Health and Children and the IMO. The contract provides that where a new post is created or a vacancy arises, that is, through the resignation, retirement or death of an existing GP, the HSE is required to place advertisements in the national and medical newspapers inviting applications from suitably qualified doctors. Open interviews are held and the successful candidate is offered the post.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">Recently a review of the GMS GP contract and other publicly funded GP services has commenced under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. This review is intended to be a fundamental and comprehensive review into all aspects of GP provided public services.</p>

            <p eId="para_935">Section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 governs the operation of the tax exemptions provided in the case of sporting bodies. The provisions of that section are administered by the Revenue Commissioners. Section 235 provides tax relief upon the income of any body of persons established for and existing for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports. Relief from capital gains tax and dividend withholding tax is also provided for under the Taxes Consolidation Act. Two categories of sports bodies are embraced by the provision: a body promoting an athletic game or athletic sport; and a body promoting an amateur game or amateur sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">Section 25 of the Finance Act 1932 was an amendment to the Finance (New Duties) Act 1916 which provided for the charging of a since defunct excise duty on specific entertainments. That has no relevance to the tax exemption provisions in the case of sporting organisations and is therefore not followed when determining which bodies qualify for the relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">In addition, a scheme was introduced in 2002 whereby tax relief is available on donations to approved sports bodies for approved capital projects similar to the tax relief in place in respect of donations to charities. This relief is aimed at providing support to sports bodies around the country that are engaged in projects of a capital nature such as the construction or refurbishment of sports facilities. There are currently some 1,500 tax exempted sports bodies, a full list of which is published on the Revenue website <i>www.revenue.ie</i> under publications/lists of bodies and organisations that qualify for relief — No. 17.</p>

            <p eId="para_942">I propose to take Questions No. 91 and 92 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">With regard to inheritance tax, I take it that the Deputy is referring to entitlements under the 2005 single payment scheme and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that payment entitlement under this scheme does not qualify as agricultural property for agricultural relief within the definition in section 89 (1) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003. Agricultural property for capital acquisitions tax purposes is defined as agricultural land, pasture and woodland situated in the State and crops, trees and underwood growing on such land and also includes such farm buildings, farm houses, and mansion houses as are of a character appropriate to the property and farm machinery, livestock and bloodstock on such property. Therefore, payment entitlement itself, being an asset that is separate from the lands, crops and buildings, does not qualify for agricultural relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">However, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that such payment entitlements may qualify for business relief under Part 10, chapter 2, Capital Acquisition Tax Consolidation Act 2003. Where a gift or inheritance consists of business property, the value of the business may also be reduced by 90%, provided certain conditions are met. Business relief is available for transfers of relevant business property which the disponer has owned for two years in respect of an inheritance taken on the death of the disponer. Payment entitlement will qualify for business relief as an individual asset of the business on the assumption that the resulting payment will be used in the business or be required for future use in the business.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">In terms of whether the proceeds of the disposal of such entitlements would be chargeable to income tax or capital gains tax, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that such payment entitlements under the 2005 single payment scheme are chargeable assets for capital gains tax purposes and that gains arising from their sale will be chargeable to capital gains tax, rather than income tax, following normal capital gains tax rules.</p>

The scheme refunded employers of such seafarers their PRSI contribution for each of their seagoing employees.

            <p eId="para_973">As stated in my reply on the last occasion this matter was raised with me in May of this year, Ireland is not a signatory to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. The convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990, and it entered into force on 1 July 2003, following ratification by the requisite number of states, 20. The convention has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990. However, to date only 33 states have ratified it. No European Union member state has as yet signed or ratified the convention, nor has any indicated an intention to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The convention on the rights of migrant workers has been examined by my Department. It would appear that in order for Ireland to ratify the convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our EU commitments. The operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK might also possibly be affected. There are, therefore, no plans to sign the convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">It should also be noted that the rights of migrant workers and their families are already protected under existing national legislation and under the Irish Constitution, as well as under EU law. In addition, the rights of migrant workers and their families are also addressed by Ireland's commitments under international human rights instruments to which the State is already a party. These international instruments include, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">Ireland has consistently supported the right of the Saharawi people to self-determination. The Government played a prominent role in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara dispute during Ireland's term on the UN Security Council. Security Council Resolution 1495 of July 2003 recommended the acceptance by all sides of the Baker II plan. The plan proposes a transitional period of four to five years, during which Western Sahara would be self-governing under Moroccan sovereignty. At the end of this period, a referendum would be held, to give residents a choice between independence, integration with Morocco or autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. The Government believes that these proposals represent the best framework for a negotiated settlement which fully respects the right to self determination of the Saharawi people. Algeria and the Polisario Front have indicated their broad acceptance of the proposals. Morocco continues to reject them. The UN Secretary General has recently appointed a new special representative, Mr. Peter Van Walsum, to continue efforts to secure agreement between the parties. The Government will strongly support Mr. VanWalsum's work.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">I met the foreign affairs representative of the Polisario Front, Mr. Mohammed Salek, on 19 September, during my visit to New York for the UN General Assembly. We discussed the situation in the Western Sahara and the prospects for political progress. I particularly welcomed the release by Polisario in August of the remaining Moroccan prisoners held since the end of the war. This week the issue has also been the subject of the annual debate at the Fourth Committee at the UN, dealing with decolonisation issues. Ireland has played an active part in consideration of the issue, and I am pleased that the discussions resulted in a consensus resolution of the committee, which both Morocco and Algeria supported, and which was welcomed in a statement delivered by the EU Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">On the question of recognition, the Government's position remains that there is as yet no Saharan state that meets internationally established criteria for recognition. Such a step would in any event prejudge the outcome of the ongoing UN efforts, which have our full support.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The continuing plight of the Saharawi refugees in camps in the Tindouf area of Algeria remains an issue of considerable concern. In September 2004, Development Co-operation Ireland provided funding of €200,000 to the UNHCR for a programme of measures to assist the Saharawi refugees, including provision of telephone connections with their home communities, and family visits to and from the refugee camps. These measures have continued in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">On the question of fishing rights, I set out the overall principles in some detail in my reply to Question No. 87 of 2 June 2005 from Deputy Broughan. The key issue is that Western Sahara is a non-self-governing territory. Exploration and exploitation activities that proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the Saharawi people would be in violation of the international law principles applicable to natural resource activities in non-self-governing territories.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The EU — Morocco fisheries agreement, which was initialled by the European Commission on 28 July 2005, will provide for limited access to Moroccan waters in return for a set payment to Morocco. The provisions on the geographical scope of the agreement are identical to those of the previous agreement with Morocco, which expired in 1999. Article 2 of the agreement states that it applies "to the Moroccan fisheries zone under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco". The Commission has stated that this does not prejudice the issue of the status of Western Sahara.</p>

            <p eId="para_986">I do not need to commission a study in relation to regional tourism statistics. Regional tourism statistics are routinely available through information already captured by the Central Statistics Office in conjunction with Fáilte Ireland. The Fáilte Ireland survey of overseas travellers, SOT, involves interviewing 10,000 overseas visitors annually, on departure. A question in that survey identifies each location in Ireland where overseas visitors overnighted and the number of nights that they spent in that location. The SOT captures up to 700 locations throughout the country and the results are analysed by county and by region.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">The distribution of overseas regional visits and overseas regional nights identified through the Fáilte Ireland SOT is, using a number of formulae, married to the results of the CSO's country of residence survey and the passenger card inquiry and the regional distribution of visitors and expenditure is obtained. The regional distribution of our Northern Ireland visitors and their spend is based on information supplied by NITB from the United Kingdom tourism survey, UKTS. As with visitors above, the visits are based on any overnight in the region and the spend is distributed based on the regional share of Northern Ireland visitor bed nights.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">The regional distribution of domestic visits and spend is based on the CSO household travel survey. The CSO survey provides a distribution of domestic visits and expenditure by region. These figures are adjusted by Fáilte Ireland, according to a formula, to replicate the tourist regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">This year, my Department has been in close discussion with the tourism agencies and the CSO in relation to the further development and refinement of tourism statistics. This is also an area that has been identified for North-South co-operation and I expect it to be discussed with relevant Departments and agencies in the North in the near future. The plans of both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland for 2005 have a strong focus on facilitating good growth in tourism numbers across all of our tourism regions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">One of the key features of the report of the Tourism Policy Review Group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism An Agenda for Action, is that it clearly highlights the different stakeholders that affect tourism development, and the need for co-ordinated and integrated action to influence the wider agenda that impacts on Irish tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">At the time of its launch, in September 2003, I undertook to ensure that the large number of recommendations would be pursued, not only by my own Department and the State agencies under my remit, but also with industry representative bodies and my ministerial colleagues, having secured Government approval to engage in consultations with the Ministers involved on the implications of the recommended actions in the report affecting them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">For my part, in order to ensure that the implementation of the tourism action plan was given the priority recommended by the review group, I established a high-level implementation group, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Travers, to drive forward and monitor the plan. I am very appreciative of the commitment shown by the chair and members of the implementation group. I believe that their approach is very robust and wide-ranging, their deliberations are insightful and the level of engagement with stakeholders is very meaningful.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">My Department is providing the secretariat to the implementation group and is using the process as a mechanism for more effective interaction with other Departments through which, for example, very productive dialogue has been developed with the Departments of Transport and Finance. Considerable attention is now devoted to having a more proactive role in influencing the decisions, programmes and policies of other Departments and agencies, for example, through input into memoranda for Government and by participating at meetings such as the National Competitiveness Council, the Tax Strategy Group, the enterprise strategy monitoring group and the committee on the implementation of the Consumer Strategy Group. The efforts are bearing fruit with growing recognition of tourism policy concerns in decision making and consultative processes outside the Department's aegis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">The review group's conclusion was that the "ultimate determinant of success in Irish tourism will be an energetic, innovative and profitable private sector operating within a domestic environment where Government policies and actions are supportive of business investment in tourism". Setting a target to double overseas visitor spend, to €6 billion by 2012, was a challenging one but I believe there is a real confidence, within the industry, that the full potential of the sector can be realised through shared understanding and partnership, between key decision makers in both the public and private sectors. I see my role as facilitating that understanding and partnership and I remain fully committed to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1027">State support for the Irish film industry is directed through two principal channels, namely, the section 481 tax-based incentive scheme for investment in film production and the Irish Film Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The section 481 scheme will now operate until at least the end of 2008. The amount that can be raised has increased from €10.48 million to €15 million with effect from 1 January 2005. This was a very welcome development, but I am very aware that the competitive position has become less favourable for Ireland in recent times, particularly with regard to the attraction of inward international productions. This is not because of any one factor. It results from a combination of circumstances, including the euro-dollar exchange rate, new and enhanced competition particularly from low-cost jurisdictions in eastern Europe, and the perception that Ireland has become relatively more expensive, which all have an effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">The Irish Film Board is the State body under my Department's aegis which is responsible for the promotion of an indigenous film industry in Ireland, and for marketing Ireland abroad as a location for film making. The report of the film industry strategic review group published in August 1999, usually referred to as the Kilkenny report, recommended that the Irish Film Board be given a more central co-ordinating role for the industry, and the board works proactively to fulfil this role. The board provides support, assistance, and funding to Irish film makers at all levels of the business, from those new to the business, to those who are established on the international stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">The board places great emphasis on its role in marketing Ireland overseas as a film making location. To that end, the board will shortly implement a proposal of mine to appoint a resident representative in Los Angeles, to establish much closer contacts with the leading studios in their home base, to identify what is needed to secure productions for Ireland, and to work with the board and my Department in devising appropriate responses. My Department's funding for the board increased to €14.15 million, or by almost 22% in 2005 over the 2004 figure.</p>

Where earnings are in excess of €12,697.38 a year, there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of payment of deserted wife's benefit, provided gross earnings do not exceed €17,776.33 a year.

            <p eId="para_1123">The quarterly national household survey for the first quarter of 2002 shows overall occupational and private pensions coverage in the construction industry at 35.8% for employees and 48.4% for those who are self-employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">The main occupational scheme in the sector is the construction federation operatives pensions scheme. This scheme operates as a registered employment agreement under the Industrial Relations Acts. There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions. Compliance with the terms of the scheme is enforced through the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, the Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">The Pensions Board also has a role in the scheme in so far as compliance with the various aspects of the Pensions Act are concerned. The Pensions Board recently facilitated a report on the scheme in question in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. The report was undertaken by Mercers and it found that 80% of the estimated 80,000 eligible employees in the industry are covered by the scheme. However, the report does highlight the fact that an estimated 70,000 operatives are classed as self-employed and are therefore not eligible to join the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">Pension schemes are required to certify to the Pensions Board at periodic intervals whether they satisfy the funding standard. This is a measure of whether the scheme would have sufficient assets to meet its liabilities if it wound up at a specified date. Schemes must also include a statement in their annual report, which must be made available to members and trade unions, from the actuary confirming whether or not they meet the funding standard. The construction federation operatives pension scheme has confirmed that it is not in deficit.</p>

The present value, in 2005 prices, of this gross figure is quoted in the report as being just over €600 million. It should be noted that in addition to projected licence fee receipts based on tolls collected, this figure is inclusive of projected VAT, corporation tax and rates receipts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">I understand that the NRA proposes to fund the M50 upgrade works through the annual licence fee share of the West Link toll revenue to 2020 as well as toll revenues from West Link for a period after the expiry of the current concession in 2020. Tax revenues to the Exchequer and rates receipts by local authorities will not be earmarked in this way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1151">I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 135 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">My Department has been and is continuing to assess the risk of the introduction of avian influenza into Ireland and to keep its contingency arrangements under constant review. While continuing to maintain a vigilant approach, the Department will maintain a measured approach and ensure that such steps as are considered appropriate are put in place taking account of the level of risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">The Department has introduced an early warning system with the assistance of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and Birdwatch Ireland. This system, which involves the reporting of increased or unusual patterns of wild bird mortality, is part of a more intensified approach to wild bird surveillance and is a critical element in the early detection of the disease. As part of our approach to increased surveillance, my Department has had a number of recent meetings with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland. The two Departments have undertaken to continue to work closely together and to exchange the results of their respective wild bird surveillance programmes. In addition, my Department has updated its biosecurity advice for poultry flockowners, reissued information on the symptoms of exotic poultry diseases and issued information to poultry flockowners on measures to reduce the risk of introducing avian influenza.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">Following the confirmation of the outbreaks of avian influenza in Turkey and Romania, which I agree with the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection are very worrying, my Department reassessed the risk of the introduction of the disease into Ireland. Following that assessment, I have decided to introduce a number of additional measures commensurate with the increased risk. Specifically, I asked my officials to request further support from the Customs and Excise service to supplement my Department's efforts, and I been assured of their full co-operation and assistance in support of our efforts. Additional resources from my Department are also being deployed at Dublin Airport. I have also arranged that the advice to travellers to and from countries affected by avian influenza be updated and reissued. This updated advice is published in today's national newspapers and is, like all the other information-advice notices, available on my Department's website Having considered the recent developments, my Department has again considered the compulsory housing of all free-range poultry but has decided that, taking full account of the risk, such a measure is not necessary at this stage. Like all contingency measures, this will continue to be kept under constant review. I am satisfied that my Department has and is continuing to put in place such measures as are appropriate to the level of risk at this time. My Department has at all times complied fully with its international obligations and is operating to best practice. In that regard, I am satisfied that the measures introduced to date incorporate the recommendations of various international organizations, including the EFSA.</p>

            <p eId="para_1168">Following the introduction of the single payment scheme, the production of crops for energy purposes will, in common with all agricultural production in future, be demand driven. Farmers will only produce crops for bioenergy if the economic returns are greater than those offered by more traditional uses. The production of liquid biofuels from energy crops is not economic at current oil price levels. However, the scheme for mineral oil tax relief on pilot biofuel projects recently announced by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, is important in stimulating the production of energy crops, as the current payment under the single payment scheme for that purpose in itself is insufficient.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">Teagasc, which has responsibility for the provision of research and advisory services for the agri-food sector, has done some valuable work on energy crops.

Under Article 23 of EU Council Regulation 795/2004, a farmer shall receive an allocation from the national reserve if he participated in national programmes of reorientation of production. The only national programme of reorientation of production, which operated in Ireland, was the milk quota restructuring scheme and provisions were made for such applicants within the national reserve under category C.

The estimated total annual payroll costs including pay, allowances and employers' PRSI, but excluding overtime, for a member of the force in his-her first year following qualification from the Garda college is €39,767. It is difficult for me to provide the Deputy with an estimate of typical overtime costs for a newly qualified member of the Garda Síochána, since overtime is contingent on Garda operational needs which vary between Garda districts throughout the year. Accordingly, it would be misleading for me to apply an average overtime earnings figure for any particular member of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">The cost of personal equipment and uniform is approximately €580 per member. Pension overhead costs, inclusive of employee contributions, are estimated to be 30% of pensionable pay and allowances and would amount to €10,500 approximately.</p>

            <p eId="para_1192">As the Deputy may be aware, the examination of Ireland's combined fourth and fifth reports on progress under the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, was held in New York in July 2005, following the submission of the reports in June 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">The CEDAW committee issues concluding comments and recommendations for further action following the examination. These reports were positively received by the committee and the comments were generally favourable. The committee raised a number of issues which it deemed to require some further action including: stereotypical views of the roles of women and men as reflected in the Constitution, education and employment and in women's low participation in political and public life; the need for a comprehensive strategic view and framework for the achievement of gender equality; the need for a strategic approach to combat trafficking in women and girls; the under-representation of women in political structures and at higher levels in the Civil Service; and the barriers faced by vulnerable groups in accessing education, employment, health care and other social services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">My Department has circulated the committee's comments and recommendations to all relevant Departments asking that they consider them and report on how the issues might be advanced before Ireland's next report under CEDAW, which is due for submission to the UN CEDAW committee in January 2007.</p>

The agency monitors its accommodation on an ongoing basis, having regard to accommodation demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">In light of the recent reduction in numbers requiring accommodation, the agency contacted a number of proprietors, whose contracts were due to expire, to indicate that it was not in a position to offer any follow-on contracts. The contract for the accommodation centre at North Quay Place expired on 18 September 2005 and all the residents were relocated to other accommodation centres on a phased basis between 4 August 2005 and 14 September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">In deciding where to relocate asylum seekers, account is taken of individual circumstances including medical, family, child welfare and education concerns, where such circumstances are made known to the reception and integration agency. In the case of the North Quay Place accommodation centre, there were a limited number of vacancies available in the Cork area and it was not possible to facilitate all requests to remain in Cork city. However, among those relocated from the centre, a total of 65 asylum seekers were re-accommodated in Cork city and surrounding areas and a further 49 were re-accommodated in centres in Cork county.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">I understand that the Deputy is referring to a specific former resident of North Quay Place accommodation centre who was given a placement in self-catering accommodation in Dublin.

            <p eId="para_1210">I recently made a number of changes to the rules governing entry to An Garda Síochána, including removing the requirement to hold a qualification in both Irish and English in the leaving certificate or equivalent, in favour of a requirement, instead, to hold a qualification in two languages, at least one of which must be Irish or English.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">Irish society is increasingly multi-ethnic and multicultural and the previous absolute requirement for Garda trainees to hold an academic qualification in Irish was undoubtedly a barrier to membership of An Garda Síochána for many persons. Changes to the eligibility criteria will open up entry to An Garda Síochána to persons from all of our multi-ethnic and multi-national communities. This is a significant step which will help to ensure that future intakes of recruits to An Garda Síochána reflect the composition of Irish society, to the benefit of the force and the people it serves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">However, Irish will continue to have an important place in An Garda Síochána. Everyone who wishes to must be able to communicate with the force through our native language. An Garda Síochána has a very strong commitment to delivering a service through Irish. Indeed, proficiency in Irish is strongly promoted within the force, and that will continue to be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">Future recruits to An Garda Síochána who do not have a qualification in Irish when commencing their period of training will be required to achieve an appropriate standard in Irish before becoming full members of the force. To facilitate this, it is intended that these recruits will be given basic training in the Irish language as part of their training programme. Details of the Irish language educational requirements of trainee gardaí will be finalised shortly by the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with my Department and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív.</p>

            <p eId="para_1215">The visa applications were received by my Department on 2 August 2005, and were for the purposes of allowing the children of two non-EEA nationals travel to the State to reside with them here. It appears that the father of the children was a work permit holder for a number of years. Subsequently, both he and his wife applied for residency in the State based solely on parentage of a child born in the State and this was granted in March 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">Applicants for permission to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child were made fully aware of Government policy in this area, that is, that persons granted residency on that basis should not expect to have any entitlement to be joined in the State by other family members. This fact was clearly stated on the front page of the application form for such residency. The application form also included a statutory declaration to be signed by applicants indicating their acceptance, <i>inter alia,</i> that the granting of permission to remain does not confer any entitlements or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related or not, to enter the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">The visa applications were the subject of an appeal at which time additional information was supplied to my Department. However, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned. Consequently, the decision to decline the grant of a visa to the children was upheld on 27 September 2005. However, in the circumstances of this case, I am prepared to consider any fresh representations which may be made by the persons concerned outlining reasons they feel their particular case should be regarded as an exceptional circumstance which would warrant the approval of the visas in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1240">Arts education, including visual arts, music and drama, is one of the seven subject areas that comprise the primary curriculum, which was revised in 1999 and is being implemented on a phased basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">The primary curriculum support programme, PCSP, provides professional development support to teachers to assist them in implementing the curriculum. The PSCP is engaged in a wide-range of support activities, including organising seminars for teachers, visiting schools and providing tailored support for individual schools and clusters of schools. Visual arts has already been implemented in schools. An evaluation of implementation of the primary curriculum published in 2005 concluded that the visual arts curriculum was generally being implemented successfully in schools, and that pupils were encouraged to explore, interpret and enjoy art activities, and to learn through art as well as about art. Areas for improvement identified related to planning, the integration of ICT, involvement of parents and assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">The in-career development programme for music took place in the school year 2004-05, with the revised curriculum being fully implemented in schools in 2005-06. In-service for drama will take place in the school year 2006-07 with implementation the following year. Once the initial in-service training for teachers is completed, ongoing support continues to be provided through the cuiditheoir service of the primary curriculum support service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">At post-primary level, there are approved syllabuses for junior certificate in music and art, craft and design. In the senior cycle, there are syllabuses in music and art. Modules in the arts are also available as part of the leaving certificate applied. In the transition year programme, schools offer a variety of modules which stimulate pupils' interest in the arts in general and which, in many cases, give them the opportunity to interact with practising artists in their own classrooms and in other contexts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">The leaving certificate syllabus in music was revised for first examination in 1999. The assessment structure allows students to specialise in the component of the course best suited to their interests and ability. The broad range of performance options available to students has increased accessibility to the subject and allows for students of diverse music backgrounds to participate in the subject. A revised syllabus in leaving certificate art has been prepared by the NCCA and will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The school completion programme is designed to encourage an integrated in-school and out of school approach which encourages optimum engagement of schools with parents and community interests in disadvantaged areas. In school and out-of-school activities in the visual arts, music, and drama can play an important part in the overall strategy to promote a multifaceted and multi-intelligence response to tackling disadvantage. In addition to the above, the tin whistles for teachers initiative was announced in March 2005 under which 25,400 primary school teachers are being provided with tin whistles and in-service training in a partnership development between the Irish Recorded Music Association Trust, the primary curriculum support programme and the Department of Education and Science. The initiative was launched by the Minister with The Corrs at the National Concert Hall at an event featuring children playing the tin whistle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">In addition to supporting music in the curriculum, an additional allocation of 92.76 whole-time teaching posts are allocated to a range of VECs to support music education in the form of individual tuition in instrumental and vocal music education, and provision of supports for choirs, orchestras and ensembles. Through this, some 68,000 hours of music tuition are provided annually.</p>

My Department understands it was not possible to provide concessionary transport in respect of all of the pupils concerned as sufficient seats were not available after all eligible pupils were accommodated.</p>

            <p eId="para_1252">The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. No such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.

            <p eId="para_1258">The funding my Department provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patrúnachta na Gaelscoileanna, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. However, following discussions with Educate Together, my Department has provided additional funding to Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">With regard to support for the establishment of new multi-denominational schools, my Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage — 11 of which are open. My Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by Educate Together, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to €63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, County Dublin, which was designed and built in under 13 months.</p>

The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and it will involve an additional annual investment of some €40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis processes are being managed by the ERC on behalf of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters-communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools in relation to the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.</p>

It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, to whom the Deputy refers. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1306">A new general allocation scheme has been introduced under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. My officials have been in contact with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which has confirmed that following an examination of educational supports for the pupil in question, it was determined that his needs fall within the high incidence disability category. Therefore his needs fall to be met from within the school's general allocation of one full-time teaching post and ten part-time hours under the new general allocation system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs, such as hearing impairment, will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school has been allocated enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">My Department recently issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.</p>

Arrangements are in place for the transfer of registration fee moneys from the board to the local authorities in recognition of their registration fee income foregone. The transfer will be based on each authority's performance in enforcing the standards and rent books regulations as evidenced by their statistical returns, as well as the level of registrations relating to their functional areas and the need to distribute income across the four-year tenancy cycle. Those new arrangements will mean that authorities continue to be specifically resourced for this function with a view to supporting greater enforcement activity of the standards regulations on their part.</p>

With the availability of more robust materials, asbestos-cased cement piping is no longer used for water mains, and the proportion of such piping in the region would now be significantly less because of the extent of the new pipework that has been installed in the meantime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">Local authorities are currently compiling comprehensive data on their water supply networks that will include details on the type of pipework currently in place, and that process is expected to be completed by the end of 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_1459">Waterford County Council first submitted a proposal for a new fire station at Tallow in 1991. However, that proposal was not approved under the limited funding programme then in place. In September 2001, approval in principle was granted for a new fire station at Tallow and a detailed cost plan and drawings were submitted in November 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">In 2002, the Department announced that new fire stations at Ardmore and Tallow as well as improvement works to Cappoquin would be included in the fire services capital programme. Ardmore fire station was completed this year at a cost of more than €800,000 and the improvement works to Cappoquin have also been completed at a cost of approximately €100,000. Although it was not possible to include the Tallow project in this year's programme, it will be considered for advancement to construction along with Waterford County Council's other proposals under future programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">There is no formal rating scheme for fire station proposals. Proposals submitted by fire authorities are considered on a case-by-case basis having regard to the existing facilities, proximity of other fire stations, the fire authority's priorities and the competing demands of other fire authorities for the available funding. A balance also has to be struck between funding for fire station projects and for new fire appliances and other equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">Overall, County Waterford has benefited greatly from funding under the fire services capital programme in recent years. As well as the Ardmore and Cappoquin projects, a new headquarters fire station at Dungarvan was completed in 1994 at a cost of more than €1.2 million and an extension to Tramore fire station in 2001 at a cost of more than €400,000. County Waterford has also received funding for seven new fire appliances since 1998 at a total cost of more than €1.5 million. There are other fire station proposals on hand since 2001 which, for a variety of reasons, have not yet been approved for funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_1464">Responsibility for enforcement of the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, including the enforcement of on-the-spot fines, is a matter for local authorities.

This data is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">In response to inquiries from my Department, local authorities have indicated that the level of litter on-the-spot fine payment is affected by a range of factors, including provision by offenders of false or misleading information; offenders moving address with no forwarding address available; waiving of fines on appeal, for example, on compassionate grounds; lapse of statutory period for pursuing non-payment; incorrect issue of fine notices; issue of two or more fine notices in respect of the same offence, for example, to a number of occupants of a house, where the local authority subsequently deems it more appropriate to accept a single payment and annuls the other fines; and fines being struck out in court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">I am satisfied that the penalties and enforcement powers under existing litter legislation are adequate, and there are no proposals to change the law along the lines mentioned in the question.
