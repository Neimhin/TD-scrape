The Minister is familiar with the long history of trying to address the abuse, forced labour and difficult life circumstances of the residents of residential institutions. The State has, to a greater or lesser extent, been trying to get to grips with this for many years. The issue that particularly concerns me is the follow on from Caranua, and the lack of action that has taken place in the past short few years. We know that what was first the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund was set up in 2012, and was later renamed Caranua on foot of, if I recall correctly, some of the draft recommendations of the Ryan report being worked on at the time. The context of this, of course, is that many tens of thousands of children in residential institutions were subject to the most horrific abuse. Their childhoods were effectively stolen from them. Relationships with family were sundered, and in many instances they were forced to undertake significant labour. This left many of those children and survivors, many of whom have unfortunately passed away, in circumstances of hardship, emotional trauma, poverty and ill health. That is the legacy many of these institutions have left. A number of difficulties have flowed from that. Many survivors were dissatisfied with the way Caranua has carried out its business. They felt badly let down and even re-traumatised in some instances, with claims being closed where there was no real basis for closing. However, the part I want to focus on is the fact that after Caranua was wound down, there was supposed to be a follow on. A group of survivors met with a group of facilitators appointed by the Minister's Department late in 2019 and came up with a number of recommendations. Those recommendations centred around fundamental things such as enhanced medical care or an enhanced medical card, housing entitlements, or a pension, as was the case with the survivors of the Magdalen institutions. Those proposals were submitted late in 2019, which is now more than three years ago. I understand there was one further meeting in late 2020, which the Minister was part of, but there has been nothing since then. They feel badly let down. They feel they are in the dark. I have raised with this with the Minister a number of times and she has informed me there is work going on behind the scenes. However, as far as they are concerned, nothing is happening, and time is not immaterial here. Most of these are older people, some of them are in very poor health, and of course they are worried. As time goes on more and more survivors will pass on and will not be in a position to benefit from any proposals that need to be brought forward. The vacuum, which is there at the moment, is completely unacceptable. They feel very hurt by some of the issues that arose out of Caranua, and how that was handled. That has been catalogued and reported, but they feel hurt now by the lack of progress, and the lack of feedback they are getting. I have a final point before I allow the Minister to respond. There is a particular category I will flag, namely, those survivors now living in Britain and elsewhere who feel completely out of the loop. What is the state of play and when are we going to finally get some feedback from those recommendations?

Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach. Tá an-chuid oibre déanta go dtí an pointe seo agus táim buíoch den Teachta as an seans é sin a chur os comhair an Teach seo. I thank the Deputy and I want to acknowledge his personal engagement and interest in this, and I am fully cognisant of the importance of the body of work ongoing in relation to this. I want to say very clearly at the outset that the views of survivors of institutional abuse must be, and are, central when considering future supports and services to meet their needs. For that reason, as the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Education has been engaged in a structured process of consultation with survivors and survivor groups over a number of years, as he has outlined. This process began with the engagement by the Department of professionally qualified facilitators to undertake a series of consultations with survivors on the themes and issues of most specific concern to them. The facilitators engaged with more than 100 people and held more than 30 meetings. These meetings enabled survivors to reflect on their experiences, the State's response to the issue of institutional abuse and to make any recommendations they might wish to make. This phase of the process resulted in the submission to the Department of Education of a report entitled Consultations with Survivors of Institutional Abuse and Themes and Issues to be Addressed by a Survivor Led Consultation Group. The report identified a number of priority issues for survivors, including the health needs of an aging population and the need to make services easier to access. Phase 2 of the process involved the establishment of a survivor-led consultative forum to further consider the themes and issues identified. This was again supported by facilitators who were engaged by the Department of Education. A method the Deputy outlined was for the forum to personally engage with survivors in Ireland, and indeed in the United Kingdom, and to hear directly from them. Officials from my Department have also met with the forum on a number of occasions to discuss its work. I would like to acknowledge the commitment and insight of the survivors who have participated in the consultation process, as well as the support and significant expertise provided by the facilitators involved in the process. The final report of the forum was submitted to the Department last year. The report has provided a very good insight into the areas where survivors feel that supports are required into the future. As the Deputy will be aware, there are also a number of other published reports highlighting the ongoing needs of survivors and the lifelong difficulties they encounter due to their childhood experiences in residential care. These reports, alongside other relevant submissions, are currently being considered by the Department with input from colleagues from other Departments. Significant resources continue to be devoted to the progressing of this work and will feed into the consideration of proposals to Government in this context. In parallel with this process, the Department has also been engaging with officials from other relevant Departments to identify existing services which are of particular relevance to survivors and to examine how these services can support survivors into the future. This engagement is also feeding into consideration of proposals to Government which will be progressed in the shortest timeframe possible. I would also like to note that as part of the State's response to individual's experience of stress as a result of trauma and abuse in childhood, a free professional and confidential national counselling service is operated by the HSE. Full details of this are available on the HSE's website.

Before I continue I want to clarify something. The response may have been drafted late last year given that this Topical Issue matter was to be taken last year, which is fair enough, and it might just be an error. The response states that the consultative forum's report was submitted late last year. I would say that should state "in late 2021" because I have a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, and the response to that written question, which was given in December 2022, suggests the document was submitted "last year". Will the Minister clarify this? Was it submitted in 2021 or 2022? I suspect it was 2021. Obviously, there is a huge difference. If it was late 2022, it could only be a few weeks ago and we could all understand the delay. However, in reality, I think it is almost 13 months since that report was submitted. If the Minister has the information to hand, I would appreciate if she could clarify this. The response I have received here does not give me a whole lot of new information. These are all ongoing processes but survivors listening in and reading back on this afterwards will be wondering about the timeline and when are things actually going to happen. I have no indication of that here and this is what people need. As I already very clearly outlined, many of these people are older, many are in poor health and some of them are in very poor housing conditions. Some of them are suffering very severe hardship even to this day, despite the efforts of organisations in the past. Counselling and so on is all well and good but that is to do with their trauma and their emotional well-being, and it is important that those supports are there, but these people have material needs as well that have not been fully addressed. The pension, which was provided to the Magdalen laundries survivors, is a huge issue for them. It would provide stability and a decent standard of income in their final years as well as housing and enhanced health care as was provided in those other instances. What is timeline and when was that report submitted?

I will not lead the Deputy astray regarding the date. I will check it and get back to the Deputy today with the information. I want to reiterate that I am very cognisant of and I fully understand the importance of the view of the survivors being at the heart of what we are seeking to achieve here. I want acknowledge that the report of the consultative board, which was a very significant body of work, has been funded by the Department and externally facilitated. The fact that it was externally facilitated is hugely important. There was an independent facilitation of the entire process. Along with other relevant reports and submissions, it is under active consideration by the Department with input from other relevant Departments. Deputy Ó Laoghaire outlined the variety of areas of interest of survivors and he will recognise that they are cross-departmental. We are engaged in a significant body of work. In terms of the body of work and the reports provided, I want to acknowledge that it has been valuable because it is these reports and submissions that are providing an insight into the issues which the survivors have nominated as being of most importance. The Department will continue to work with other Departments in many of the areas the Deputy highlighted, particularly in relation to areas of health and all the different issues that have been raised and were worked through in other instances. It is a significant body of work and it is continuing. I appreciate that we need the quickest resolution possible to this and I appreciate the urgency. It will be in the shortest timeframe possible. I am happy to keep the Deputy updated in that regard. A significant cross-departmental approach is being taken. In terms of resources, there are other agencies involved, aside from the Department of Education, and we are moving that work ahead as quickly as we can.

Almost 90 of those women die from it. In women aged from 25 to 39 years cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death due to cancer. It is the responsibility of individuals, families, communities and the State to do everything possible to drive this number down. This week is European Cervical Cancer Prevention Week and an important week to highlight that cervical screening is one of the best ways to protect from cervical cancer. Recognising the importance of this protective measure, the State provides free, regular cervical screening tests to women aged between 25 and 65. I, like thousands of others in Ireland, am used to receiving letter informing me that my screening is due. I cannot emphasise how important it is to make this appointment. We are all busy and rushing around but this screening is a vital part of health care. When discussing this, it is important to acknowledge the CervicalCheck scandal. The tragic death of Vicky Phelan is a symbol of this massive and unforgivable State failure. Her dedication and unyielding spirit brought this scandal to light. We now know that 206 women had developed cervical cancer after having a misdiagnosed CervicalCheck smear test. Of these, 106 were not informed of the initial incorrect results. We are still feeling the impacts of this scandal. While I strongly disagree with the Government's handling of much of this matter, including the adversarial tribunal, the important thing for us a public representatives now is to highlight the reforms of the system and the absolute necessity of regular screening. There has been reform of the cervical screening programme because of Vicky Phelan and many other women who became involved in the CervicalCheck issue. In Dr. Gabriel Scally's final review of the implementation of changes to the CervicalCheck screening programme, he said that women can have confidence in and should take full advantage of the cervical screening programme. It has saved many women's lives and will continue to do so. Nonetheless, there were issues raised in the scandal that need to be addressed. Open disclosures are crucial to help prevent the likes of the CervicalCheck scandal in the future. The Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 is the main legislative reform to change the culture of the health service through a system of mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents. However, that Bill is moving disgracefully slowly given its significance. It was introduced in 2019 under the previous Government and there was a nine month delay between Committee Stage and Report Stage. This legislation needs to be progressed. The Bill needs to be prioritised and advanced immediately. The other major issue which goes to the heart of the CervicalCheck scandal is the commitment for a national screening laboratory. The HSE response to the final Scally review notes that this lab has been commissioned, however there is long delay for it to be completed. Screenings are still being sent to the United States for analysis and while we are assured by experts that this is an effective and reliable system there is still the Government commitment and the public desire for a national cervical screening laboratory, fully staffed with appropriate medics and scientists. This is essential. Will the Minister of State provide an update on this important matter? Although there are outstanding issues, from the CervicalCheck scandal it essential that all public representatives align and advocate for everyone to avail of these really important screening processes.

This week marks European Cervical Cancer Prevention Week. This is significant initiative in women's health and it is the first time the world has committed to eliminating a cancer as a public health problem. It is a perfect opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem for women in Ireland.The HSE launched Ireland's roadmap to reach the global targets set by the WHO. In Ireland we are already well on the way and we are in a strong position to meet the targets. This is due in large part to the introduction of cervical screening and improvements in early diagnosis as well as our HPV vaccination programme. The incidence and mortality rates from cervical cancer are declining. We are all united in our desire to eliminate this cancer, which is within reach of us. We are one of a small number of countries with the best in class testing and offering HPV screening, and this is more effective than previous screenings. As well as screening we also have a highly effective HPV vaccination programme. Last year the Minister announced an extension to the programme, the Laura Brennan HPV vaccination catch-up programme. It is important to acknowledge the role Senator Martin Conway from Clare played in this. He raised it with me more than three times in the past two years in the Seanad and has been a very strong advocate. This programme now offers an additional opportunity to those who were previously eligible for the HPV vaccine but, for whatever reason, did not get it. The Minister was pleased to show his strong commitment to the elimination of cervical cancer and has invested more than €750,000 through the women's health fund. This is for the strategy, information, and communication campaigns and the new HPV vaccination catch-up portal. Included in this funding is a research element to explore the use of self-sampling of cervical cancer, which may assist in understanding and assessing barriers in marginalised groups when providing cervical screening. Importantly, National Cancer Registry Ireland has reported that, since the introduction of cervical screening in 2008, the incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer are declining. Women who attended screening were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage. We know some populations are less likely to take up invitations to screening. CervicalCheck is committed to identifying any barriers to participation and working to overcome these. CervicalCheck regularly runs targeted campaigns to raise awareness among women over 50 that screening is still for them and the importance of taking up screening invitations. Screening at regular intervals is one of the best ways to reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer. It is exciting that we are one of the leading nations in cervical cancer prevention and that we continue to see our programme adapt and evolve. The WHO European regional director, Dr. Hans Kluge, has acknowledged and welcomed Ireland's new roadmap and our commitment, saying they look forward to Ireland as a trailblazer in achieving this ambitious goal. Most importantly, I urge Members to inform everybody, particularly women, parents, and young adults to get informed about the causes of cervical cancer and to understand how HPV vaccination, cervical screening, early treatment and awareness of symptoms are the key tools to fight against cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is preventable and curable if detected early and managed effectively. The HSE is running an extensive social media and communications campaign to highlight that. I am conscious the Deputy has raised issues that I have not addressed in the script and which I will bring back to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, about open disclosure and the laboratory in Ireland. They were not addressed in the script but it needs to be addressed.

I would appreciate an update on the laboratory. The Minister of State is also right to highlight that awareness and accessibility are essential to the success of the programme and ultimately to the prevention of deaths. The Department of Health and the HSE must continue to promote and explain the relevance of the service, and this must include multifaceted campaigns to reach everyone between the ages of 25 and 65. The Minister of State mentioned social media initiatives as being important to reach younger cohorts. We need easy to read information to improve accessibility and translated materials to reflect the diversity of people living in Ireland. On this particular issue I am glad the Minister of State is taking the question instead of the Minister for Health. Accessibility is an issue that is continually raised at the Committee on Disability Matters, especially around women's health. Physical barriers around entering GP surgeries or health centres are still common, and the complexity of transport remains a massive obstacle for people with disabilities in accessing healthcare. It is only right the screening service is free, but the Government needs to ensure there are no financial barriers to anyone who needs to access the service, because it is something disabled women have highlighted to the committee. People with a disability often live on fixed and limited incomes and have to pay for taxis and other transport to avail of services, and that sometimes involves delaying appointments or not making appointments, so we need to do everything possible to avoid those situations. While we appreciate the importance of the service, there are more steps the Government and HSE could take to ensure greater uptake and accessibility. I urge the Minister of State to look at those and engage with all stakeholders to develop a truly universal, free and accessible service. It was Disabled Women Ireland in particular who spoke strongly on that at the committee.

When particular campaigns are being run and women have the opportunity to participate, there should be no barriers, especially when it comes to transport. We know accommodation issues such as access to primary care need to be addressed, particularly where a lady cannot access a particular service for whatever reason. I believe we have learned from Covid-19. We have inreach models and outreach models, so nothing should prevent the opportunity for that person to be supported, especially when it comes to screening. There should be, however, when it comes to all health issues, inreach and outreach options and transport available, which is one matter raised by the Deputy. Transport should not be the sole reason for being able to access it. It is very important that if a person feels there are barriers, he or she should identify those barriers and communicate them, after which we need to address them from a community public health point of view, because that is what it is all about. Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this in the week that is in it. I pay particular testament to Ms Laura Brennan and her family. I acknowledge again the work the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has done along with Senator Conway on this issue for the families who have lost loved ones. The Deputy raised many issues that I, as a female, believe strongly need to be addressed in a timely fashion. It should not be adversarial by any manner or means. There should be open disclosure and that legislation should come before us. At the same time, we have the best trained people in the country and we should look at having our own screening in-house and on our own soil.

In Cobh in east Cork, which has a population of approximately 14,000 people there is a retained fire service but there are no first responders. The fire service is trained in first aid and first response. There was a case over Christmas where someone suffered a cardiac arrest. I spoke to members of the fire service. They were frustrated that they were sitting at home. They were well aware that something had happened but they could not go out to assist that person. In Cobh there is a strong community led volunteer base including a proactive Tidy Towns committee and an excellent chamber of commerce that is proactive and engaging. As there is only one road in over one bridge in Belvelly, it is sometimes difficult for the emergency services to access Cobh. I will not even go into the ambulances and so on. The crux of the matter is that this service is free to the individual when it comes to an incident. The frustration of the fire services in east Cork and especially in Cobh - that is the one I am talking about - is that they are trained and no one can give them a definitive answer as to why they cannot respond as first responders in such a vital case on an island. A report published by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, The Retained Fire Services in Ireland: a Review of Recruitment and Retention and the Future Sustainability of Service Delivery contained a caption I saved on my phone. It gave a list of items that are not charged anyway. The frustration is that while it is technically a free service to the public, there may be a charge to Cork County Council, it also includes a non-exhaustive list of waivers on incidents. I refer to where the report states "a review should be completed for any potential areas of response work that could be undertaken by the retained fire services for other agencies". I am trying to get a response from the Minister of State or some guidance on who I should go to, on behalf of the people of Cobh and east Cork, to say that if we do not have first responders in an area but have a retained fire service, it is wrong that the latter is not permitted to respond. The fire service is trained and capable of responding. It can respond. Why is it not permitted to?

I will give an overview of the fire service. The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. My Department supports fire authorities by establishing policy, setting national standards for fire safety and fire service provision, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructure projects. Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 local authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide - they do fantastic work - with 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters. A further four have a mix of full-time and retained staff and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, including the one to which the Deputy's issue relates. Responsibility for the provision of emergency medical services, including pre-hospital emergency care, rests with the HSE, which operates the National Ambulance Service, NAS, and emergency departments in hospitals in accordance with health sector legislation and national policy. Fire authorities created under section 10 of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 are empowered under section 25 of that legislation to carry out or assist in any operation of an emergency nature. The NAS may call for assistance before its crews reach an incident. Many fire services are equipped with automatic external defibrillators and the majority of fire services have trained their firefighters in cardiac first response and emergency first response to Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council standards for health and safety reasons. Therefore, fire services personnel in many fire stations are already trained and equipped to a standard that could enable them to respond to life threatening emergencies. Given the infrastructure of fire services around the country and particularly in rural locations, the retained fire service is well placed to assist the HSE with responses to such life-threatening emergency calls. As Minister of State with policy and legislative responsibility for fire safety and the provision of fire services by local authorities, a primary concern must remain, in accordance with the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, that local authority-provided fire services are meeting their statutory obligations in respect of their primary role in the provision of fire services and fire safety. These responsibilities include the important activity of community and other fire safety initiatives, as well as response to fire and emergency calls such as road traffic accidents, river rescues and chemical or hazardous spills, for example. Fire services generally respond to calls for assistance from external bodies in accordance with protocols operated within the fire services' three regional communications centres. The feasibility of the HSE commissioning fire services outside the Dublin Fire Brigade's area of operations to provide a response service to life-threatening emergency calls in support of the NAS was discussed at national level at the fire services national oversight and implementation group, which comprises fire service management and staff representatives. It produced a discussion document to underpin discussions with the health sector. The document was discussed at the management board of the national directorate for fire and emergency management in July 2018. A number of issues, including the transfer of risk and mechanisms for funding, were raised. These remain as items of discussion with the Department of Health.Any proposal for formalising this assistance would need to be subject to appropriate governance and cost reimbursement arrangements and to be set in the context of a service agreement between each participating local authority, the HSE and the NAS and must not impact on or adversely affect fire services' primary roles. It is critical that local authority and fire services' resources are not inappropriately diverted from their statutory fire service and fire safety responsibilities.

I will raise a few points in the short time I have. The retained fire services are well placed to assist the HSE with responses to such life-threatening emergency calls. There does not seem to be any obstacle to that. The National Ambulance Service is simply protecting its patch. I have not heard of any engagement between it and the fire services. The Minister of State noted "it is critical that local authority and fire services' resources are not inappropriately diverted". It is not that they are inappropriately diverted. This person died while retained fire servicemen and women were sitting at home on Christmas Day knowing that an incident was taking place. It was not possible to get an ambulance onto the island. We are playing politics with people. The National Ambulance Service does not have the capability to contact the fire service. The Minister of State knows where I stand on the HSE. It is bloated at the moment. What I am trying to do here? As a local representative I would like, if possible, to meet the National Ambulance Service, the HSE, Cork County Council and the fire service in east Cork to tell them we need a strategic plan. We are short of certain resources but have the capability to fill those gaps. Yet the Minister of State's concluding statement, as provided, states "Fire services must be confident in their ability to balance commitments so as not to impede capacity to respond to their core statutory responsibility of fire service provision". I, the Minister of State and most people know that most people who are in the fire service, the ambulance service or who are nurses, doctors or clinicians get into it for the love of it and for the attachment they have to it. At some stage in life, something affected them and they wanted to do better for society. The reason I raise this issue is to ask the Minister of State whether it would be reasonable in my capacity to meet these people to address the gaps that are there. People are dying because of red tape between three agencies, when it could be simple to fix. These people are already trained and are willing to respond. I have done the defibrillator courses and so on, so I know what to do. The greatest thing in life is giving life and protecting people. I would like to know if that is possible.

As he identified, my Department recently published a review of retained fire services. That review made a number of recommendations, one of which the Deputy referred to, namely, recommendation 6.It states, "A review should be completed for any potential areas of response work that could be undertaken by the retained fire services for other agencies." The review's recommendations are intended to support firefighters, improve working structures within the retained fire service and, ultimately, ensure the best service possible for communities that are served so well by the retained fire services. The work and response profile of the retained fire services has evolved over the years. This can be seen in the increased support for front-line work and in the assistance for other principal emergency services such as the National Ambulance Service, NAS. The scope of such work needs further consideration as necessary in areas such as medical assistance, cardiac first responders, special rescues and support. Fire services would always look to assist other emergency services when called upon. However, there currently exists no formal arrangement between the fire service, the HSE and the NAS to provide a first response service nationally and fire services are under no statutory responsibility to provide those services on behalf of another service. Fire services must be confident in their ability to balance commitments so as not to impede capacity to respond to their core statutory responsibility of fire service provision, prior to formalising any additional service level agreements. I will follow up on recommendation No. 6. There is a need for a national response and I will take that up with the national fire service to see how we can progress on that recommendation. There is a need for a national response to put formal structures in place. This is something I will follow up on with the national fire service in my capacity as Minister of State.

and- due to the restricted inshore mackerel quota, buyers made the decision to resort to Spain to provide quality line-caught fish for their discerning customers;further recognises that: - all fishers, including the inshore fishermen, have been hit extremely hard by record high fuel cost increases, while bait prices have also "soared" (mainly due to almost all bait now being imported) as larger whitefish vessels have taken advantage of tie-up schemes;- as a result of the various challenges facing the inshore sector, and the lack of Government support, crewmen are now leaving the sector, with replacement labour proving difficult, if not impossible, to procure;- unfortunately, small fishermen are facing annihilation, a problem exacerbated by the current Government which has decided the simplest solution to deal with the loss of the Irish fishing quota, due to the Brexit European Union (EU)/United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, is to decommission the whitefish fleet; - Irish boat owners are forced to sit in the harbour and watch as their EU neighbours from France and Spain land fish from Irish waters in Irish harbours, while benefiting from a fuel subsidy implemented by their governments on the back of a derogation given by the European Commission;- the larger whitefish vessels have already received four tranches of financial support, yet the Government have provided no financial support whatsoever to the inshore fishermen who are understandably feeling completely neglected at this point in time;- the European Commission has recently adopted the €285.4 million European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) 2021-2027 seafood development programme, which includes a €134 million EU contribution and a Government of Ireland contribution of €116 million, and has the objective of providing resources to mitigate the impact of the cost-of-living crisis and the war in Ukraine, through socio-economic development and support for coastal communities; - the fisheries data for 2021-2022, published in the first of what is expected to be an annual fisheries report produced by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), documents the threat posed by rising fuel and energy prices on the entire Irish fleet;- the aforementioned BIM report points out that in 2020, average fuel costs for fishers per litre were €0.42 ($0.41), whereas in mid-2022 the average stood at €0.90 ($0.88), representing a 114 per cent increase, and representing 28 per cent of the average fleet's potential operating costs; - the BIM report also found, if fuel prices and other operating costs such as insurance, repair, and maintenance remain level or continue to increase further, there is a "considerable risk" that many fishing fleets will begin to operate at a loss, forcing more and more vessels to tie up; and- the increase in operational costs is particularly challenging for vessels that have crew shares, as there are reduced wages for the crew once fuel and other operational costs are removed from the boats' income; andcalls on the Government to:- accept that the Irish inshore fleet is heavily impacted by the cost-of-living crisis and the war in Ukraine, and that direct State financial assistance of at least €12 million is now long overdue to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the crisis and support the vitality of coastal communities;- immediately allocate funds from the available EMFAF, to provide direct financial support to the Irish inshore fleet, which makes up 91 per cent of Ireland's fishing fleet; - allocate this funding to all impacted inshore boats through the BIM Grants Portal system, as it would allow for an almost instant allocation system to be rolled out, which would provide short-term immediate relief; and- urgently act to grant this unique and diverse inshore fishery fleet a greater quota allocation with diversification to other species, to facilitate and encourage young people to opt into fishing as a career, rather than coastal rural areas becoming desolate due to ongoing emigration.I thank Brian Ó Domhnaill and Mairéad McGrath in our office for putting together this motion. I am delighted to be part of the Rural Independent Group, which puts forward this motion today on behalf of every inshore fisherman, in west Cork and throughout the country. The motion is confined to inshore fishermen who, but for the Rural Independent Group, would never get a mention here in the Dáil. The Irish inshore fleet comprises approximately 91% of all fishing vessels and supports between 2,500 and 3,000 jobs in rural coastal communities. Similar to those in the bigger fleet, the livelihoods of these inshore fishermen are mainly unaided and, sadly, more and more inshore fishermen are leaving the sea, their place of employment. Storm after storm strikes our shoreline year after year but, sadly, even though many fishermen could prove massive damage or losses, a refusal here in the Dáil meant they got no aid to replace lost gear, in spite of the many calls I made. Many of the inshore fishermen I know in west Cork fish for shrimp. Their income has been severely affected by the collapse of the processed shrimp and velvet crab market, which impacts many inshore fishermen. Today, we back the call for a direct financial package of €12 million from the State. The Minister met the National Inshore Fishermen's Association before Christmas. Its members laid bare the crisis and aid is now required. The motion calls on that to be agreed. If the Government is only feeding fib stories to the inshore sector, the Minister should be honest enough to vote against the motion. Without €12 million in compensation, many of these decent people will go out of business. If this emergency fund is not announced today, I will tell every inshore fisherman and woman that they have been conned by the Government. This would not set a precedent. The Minister rightly aided the pig sector to the tune of millions last year to rescue their business, which was in a similar crisis. We also need to look at a fuel subsidy for inshore fishermen. They must spend large amounts on fuel for their inshore boats, especially as it is petrol that they use. There was a European fund to which other countries applied for their fishermen, but the Minister refused to apply it to Ireland. I presume the reason is that he would not get permission from the Green Party to help fishermen. It is intolerable that funds allocated by the EU Commission have not been apportioned to our inshore fleet, while other EU countries draw from these funds in the form of fuel subsidies for their respective inshore fleets. I will listen with great interest to what the Minister has planned to aid these hard-working men and women. While the €12 million will not be the greatest solution, it will help fishermen in some way to adjust and to prepare themselves, going forward. It is completely unacceptable for the Minister with responsibility for the marine and the Government to ignore the genuine astronomical pressures on fishermen. The lack of any financial support for this unique sector could be called cruel, in particular as up to 3,000 jobs are now in jeopardy in rural, coastal communities. Our motion today also instructs the Government to urgently grant the inshore fishery fleet a greater quota allocation, with diversification to other species. This quota need not come from quotas to the larger Irish fleet, it can come from the quotas given to other countries around the world of Irish fish out of Irish waters. I very often blame the Green Party for much of the difficulty rural Ireland finds itself in, but when it comes to fisheries it is Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that have destroyed the fishing industry in this country, as year after year, decade after decade, they turned a blind eye to every quota we could obtain and, sadly, handed away the quotas we had in our own waters. It is wrong that in this Dáil I hear Deputies either favour the inshore sector, the smaller man, or the larger fishing fleet, the so-called bigger guy. We should unite and fight as one, as it suits the Government to have them fight apart, like the old British way of divide and conquer. In negotiations with the now Tánaiste and now Taoiseach, Deputies Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar, on government formation in 2020, I had two red lines if I was to support the government. One, is that there would be no downgrading of Bantry hospital. We all see why I did not get that granted. The other was a dedicated Minister for fisheries, which was denied to me, and the country. Not even a junior or super junior Minister was offered. Even the Taoiseach at the time, Deputy Micheál Martin, asked where I thought we would find the ministries, and which one would they drop if they acceded to my request. Hey presto, when it suited to keep the nod-and-wink politics going, he parachuted two super juniors to keep the boys and girls happy. Of course, neither of them is fisheries. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, must think I am here to have a go at him personally, but I am not. I did not ask who was to be the Minister for fisheries, just to have a stand-alone Minister for fisheries solely responsible for the inshore fishing and larger fleet. This request was refused point-blank, and we now see the consequences of the actions of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, which have proven to be totally against the fishing sector down through the years. We have a massive, rich resource surrounding our country, and Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have handed it bit by bit to the foreign fleets. The Minister has funded improvements to piers, which must be welcomed, but does he realise what the fishermen have said to me recently on the issue? They say it is no longer for fishermen, because they are finished. They say the improvements will be for everybody else but them. While I mention funds, what about the funds required for Union Hall Pier? This is vital. Both the Minister and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, raised the hopes of locals in Union Hall and Glandore when they were on a damage-limitation visit to west Cork after the shocking Brexit deal, but they forgot to bring the chequebook, leaving locals angered and dismayed because it meant that much-needed works at Union Hall Pier remain undone. For those fishermen in west Cork who are fighting on, we need the Baltimore breakwater works to commence. I spoke to Independent councillor, Karen Coakley, yesterday, who told me that this can be done and that the special area of conservation, SAC, can be moved in such cases, which she is fighting to have done through Cork County Council. I urge the Minister to sit up and take note of this, as this work is urgently required for the fishermen of Baltimore. I congratulate the people of Courtmacsherry and beyond, who have kindly donated a top-of-the-range lifeboat. I had the pleasure of being with all the locals at the pier on Sunday welcoming this state-of-the-art boat, which will help save lives at sea in the years to come. I say a big thank you to all concerned, and to the volunteers on the lifeboat who put their lives at risk to help others. When every inshore fisherman or woman goes to sea, they put their lives at risk to bring food to our table and to feed their families. They must go out in all weathers. Then this work stopped. These inshore men have trained all their lives to be masters of the sea but did not train for any other profession. In the rural places I represent: Crookhaven, Goleen, Schull, Ballydehob, Bantry, Glengariff, Adrigole, Castletownbere, Union Hall and Baltimore, and further east all the way to Kinsale - I could go on - the livelihoods of these people is at risk. They will need time to adjust. I hope the Minister recognises that and will give the €12 million in aid that is being sought today. I was brought up to respect fishermen by my mother who gave us a serious warning to do so, even though she did not have a background in fishing. This is why I always call for their very survival. I now call for a change of mind in the rank and file of the Department towards fishermen. Likewise, we must have a change in the mind-set of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, towards Irish fishermen. If this does not change, the Government will wipe out both sectors. Prior to Christmas I was contacted by a fishing vessel off Castletownbere, which was being continuously surrounded by a foreign vessel. There was a near-ramming incident last year and in previous years a person's life was lost because of the carry-on. I brought the issue to the attention of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to find out where the responsibility lies. The SFPA does not seem to want to respond. The Department does not want to respond. The Taoiseach does not want to respond. It is an astonishing situation to think that Irish fishing vessels, which can prove by video that they are being circled and surrounded by foreign vessels off our waters, have no protection whatsoever. If there is an infringement by an Irish vessel, there would be no problem responding. The vessel would be surrounded and brought ashore to Irish waters to face prosecution, but when it comes to saving lives, there is nobody out there to help them. This will have to be clarified, as to who has rights and how Irish fishermen can be protected when they go to fish in waters, which is their true entitlement.However, I hope he backs the motion on the basis that €12 million will be allocated to the inshore sector and a fuel subsidy will be given to the sector immediately. If the Minister gets up to support this motion and does not give either of the requests by the inshore fishermen, he is only codding them. He will not fool us and he certainly will not fool the public. I will be listening with great intent to his speech to see what he has in store for inshore fishermen.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-25 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	16	I hope this motion will generate cross-party support across this House. We know the sector needs protection and it certainly needs its unanswered calls answered, however late in the day it may be. I commend my colleague, Deputy Collins, for all his work and the passion and leadership he has shown with regard to having fishermen's and fisherwomen's issues addressed in this House. It is high time the Minister took notice. I hope we can get support across the House. As my colleague has noted, the Irish inshore fleet comprises of approximately 91% of our fishing vessels and supports between 2,500 and 3,000 full-time jobs in rural and coastal communities. One has to wonder why it is that organisations such as the National Inshore Fishermen's Association, NIFA, have to make their argument repeatedly and loudly to Government and why it is there are such delays in responding from the Government's side. Is Government of the belief and view that inshore fishermen can simply be discarded, ignored or perhaps spoken down to in a way which they would not dream of doing to representatives, for example, of the tech industry? What really infuriates me about debates of this kind is what seems to be an acceptance that all of our natural resources are simply up for grabs or that they can be left to wither on the vine. The only natural resource about which the Government appears to give a damn is wind and we all know why that is; the big subsidies and the big boys in the corporations. That is all the Government cares about. If it is not wind, the Government does not want to know. I ask the Minister to look at the sell-out of our sugarbeet sector. It was once thriving and is now forgotten. Look at our natural oil and gas fields which have bans placed on their exploration. Look at our peat sector. In a reply to my parliamentary question, I was told 19,000 tonnes of peat and peat-related products are being exported from the country and have been exported to Japan in the past decade and yet the Government is punishing Irish people and banning them from using their own resources. There is a pattern here. All of the things we have on our doorstep and the resources we have in our seas are being divvied up and sold off with no regard to or respect for how it will impact on vulnerable coastal communities or, indeed, on rural communities. Today we are talking about inshore fisheries but tomorrow some other area of rural life will be attacked and some other indigenous sector of value will be undermined or sold out. I find it incredible. The Minister's predecessors in Fianna Fáil really must be turning in their graves. We have seen the sell-out of fisheries and now the sell-out of forestry. It is shameful. The Government has sold out and chipped away at our sovereignty. It has absolutely betrayed the Irish people and is nothing other than a shower of traitors. I will make no apologies for that statement. Where is the advantage to the Irish people and fishing communities in allowing such vital resources and activities to deteriorate to the point of collapse or the sell-out of precious resources? It is so disheartening to look back and survey the wreckage that has been delivered upon rural Ireland and coastal communities by the financial policies of a tiny, insignificant, ideological and bizarre party which is controlling the Government right, left and centre. That party is clearly the tail wagging the dog. Today, it is the turn of the fishermen and fisherwomen to suffer. Tomorrow, it will be somebody else. Make no mistake about it, the Googles or Intels of this world will not suffer. They get the red-carpet treatment. The ordinary men and women of rural Ireland, the backbone of the rural economy, are the ones who will take the brunt for the Minister's policy, lack of leadership and shameful betrayal. They will bear that brunt. However, the time is coming when the people of rural Ireland and coastal communities will say they have enough. I believe that time is now. We are sick and tired of the policies of ruin and destruction. There is simply no good reason for the Government not to support this motion or for any other party or group in this House not to support this motion. We must send a signal to the fishermen and fisherwomen of Ireland that we stand with them in solidarity, support them and will help them. If it were not for great leaders such as Fr. John Joe Duffy in Donegal, we would be in bigger trouble. At least those people have that man.

Can he imagine sitting at home, looking out the windows and seeing people farm his land and getting subsidies for it from the Government? This is exactly what is happening to the smaller boat owners sitting in the harbour on Irish waters and looking at France and Spain fishing there, while benefitting from a subsidy. The Minister's Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Government sold them out. Many people from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who are absolutely astonished and dismayed, come to me on a weekly basis and want to know what the parties they have followed all their lives are doing. They see something such as this and say, "oh my God". They ask whether Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies are really representing the parties they are supposed to represent, because they are not representing the people who have followed them. The market for shrimp and inshore fisheries has collapsed. About 1,700 of these fishermen and fisherwomen are currently in financial trouble. They are not able to claim VAT back on the petrol that they are using, even though it is available to the bigger trawlers. I ask for €12 million from the €285.4 million that is available from Europe's fund for Ireland to deal with the cost-of-living increases due to the war in Ukraine be given to the shore, shrimp and velvet crab fishermen and fisherwomen. This group is represented by the velvet crab organisation. It can be so easily done on the portal of An Bord Iascaigh Mara, BIM, because BIM has all their details. These fishermen and fisherwomen need the industry to survive. In 2020, their fuel cost was 42 cent per litre, of which our Government took 50% in tax. In 2022, they were paying 90 cent per litre, of which the Government took 50% in tax. The Government took an additional 45.5 cent in tax which is more than double of what they were paying in the previous year. It needs to give back to these people what it has taken off them in tax alone. This is the smaller side of the fishing industry which accounts for approximately 1,700 small vessels which are dealing with a loss of fish quota which the Minister's Government gave away. The Government gave away our fishing rights and the Minister is responsible for this. We heard about unfair competition from larger foreign commercial vessels from my colleague, Deputy Collins, who has been fighting for fisheries every day since he came in here. The Rural Independent Group has been fighting for it as well, with regard to the cost of living in particular - especially in fuel costs of which the Government takes 50% in tax - and the war in Ukraine and weather conditions which have been especially bad this year. I am from a farming, rather than a fishing, background, but it is the same sequence of events. Last night we stood here to discuss the same situation in forestry. Now we have forestry sold out, farming sold out and the fisheries sold out by a Government led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, with the Greens. The people, from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who put their trust in the Government to protect them in rural Ireland are dismayed to find their representatives from counties such as Limerick are not using their voices to protect the next generation of families coming through.All the Minister's Department and Government are doing is taxing them out of existence, giving away funding to larger groups and forgetting about the real people of Ireland, who are the squeezed middle working class. The Government is going for the big conglomerates. Why can it not protect the people who put it here? I call on Deputies from both Limerick city and county to stand up and represent the parties and rural Ireland, which put them here. Give us our voice back at a Cabinet where all these decisions are being made.

It is a sector which needs and deserves attention in this Dáil. It is close to my heart. I have fought tooth and nail for it as Minister to do all I can to support it. It is central to everything I do as Minister responsible for the marine. It is good to see it getting some floor time here in the Dáil. For the first time since I was appointed as Minister, it is good to see this, which is the first time that any group has tabled a motion on inshore fisheries. It is great. I thank the Deputies and ask them, please, to do it more. The Opposition in general does not give this issue enough time, so it is good to see it getting some time. It allows me an opportunity to update Deputies on things I have been doing to work with the inshore sector to develop it, promote it and try to ensure its income is protected. As I say, this is close to my heart. The inshore fishing sector is part of my local community at home, including Urris pier, Malin Head pier, Glengad pier, Bunnagee pier and Greencastle pier. All of those depend on the inshore fishing sector, including all the people in those parishes I went to secondary school with, sat in the classroom with and grew up in communities with. As Minister responsible for the marine, I have invested money in all those piers I just mentioned. An average of €20 million, on balance, has probably been invested in all those piers and harbours over the past couple of years. That just includes Inishowen. I am from north Inishowen. I have a commitment to the inshore sector throughout the country. By far the largest number of boats, although they are all small, and families are dependent on the inshore sector. I thank Deputy Collins for tabling this motion. He mentioned Union Hall pier, which I know very well. I remember two summers where I spent holidays renting an apartment in Glandore. I walked from Glandore to the fish shop in Union Hall to buy fish to take back to cook for our evening dinner. I know Union Hall well. I have invested in Glandore pier as Minister. I have not invested in Union Hall pier other than to provide some fencing, which was applied for and which I granted, but I did not receive any other application for funding for Union Hall. It is a local authority pier. I have spent more than €50 million as Minister on local authorities' small piers and harbours throughout the country in the last 18 months. Normally, in any one year, about €3 million is spent and I have spent about €50 million. Unfortunately, I have not received any application for Union Hall, which is a Cork local authority pier. If I had received an application, I assure Deputy Collins I would have done all I could to put money into it. Somebody, who seems to have been Deputy Collins, has been asleep at the wheel. He gave out to me for not giving funding for something for which I never got an application.

The Government has been committed to supporting the inshore fisheries sector in specific ways, including ensuring inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and recreational fishers and that pair trawling will be prohibited inside the six-mile limit. I am very supportive of this objective. I met specifically with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, in December last year to hear its concerns and goals for the inshore fishing sector. The NIFF and its supporting network of six regional inshore fisheries forums are consultative bodies established to foster industry-led development of proposals for the management of fish stocks within six nautical miles of the Irish shore. The NIFF is in the process of implementing the first industry-led strategy for the Irish inshore fisheries sector. Its vision is that the inshore fisheries sector will have a prosperous and sustainable future delivered through a united industry with a strong, influential voice. My Department's Food Vision 2030 strategy sets out further aims to enhance the development of sustainable inshore fisheries and to balance them with safeguarding fishing-related livelihoods and protecting the marine environment. The priorities identified in the strategy include the development of a profile for the inshore sector, building the sector's capacity to engage with policy development and enhancing the industry's understanding of management and planning for inshore sectors. I particularly welcome the forum's input to the recently updated bivalve protocol. I am satisfied it plays a vital role in defining the procedures for opening a new fishery for wild bivalve molluscs or extending the scope of an existing fishery. I also look forward to its input in addressing concerns about a recent decline in brown crab stocks along the coast. Following engagement with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, I requested a review of the management of the Irish brown crab fishery to identify measures that could be introduced to support the sustainability of brown crab stocks. That will be undertaken by a multidisciplinary working group. Importantly, I was glad to be able to announce the recognition of the National Inshore Fisheries Association as a producer organisation this week. It is an important step forward for the inshore sector. This is the second EU producer organisation, along with the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, to be awarded that recognition during my term as Minister. The sector has strong representation. There are a significant number of producer organisations and spokesperson organisations for the fishing sector. As I pointed out, for the past two and a half years when I have been Minister, there has never been a Private Member's motion about inshore fisheries. Likewise, representation by producer organisations has been light in recent years. Inshore fisheries did not have a producer organisation. There are seven or eight producer organisations across the sector but they all represent the whitefish sector, which is much larger than the inshore sector, the pelagic sector, which includes the large boats that go far out to sea, or the processing sector. Significant professional voices represent the processors, the pelagic sector and the whitefish sector, but there was no paid professional voice to represent the inshore sector. The inshore fishermen were all too busy at sea, making a living, but did not get their voice heard at a national level. I have worked with them to change that. They now have two producer organisations that have staffed offices and paid professionals working day-to-day, all year round, to represent them and make sure their voice is heard at a national level and they get fair play within the sector as well as from Government. I will address a few other issues in the short time I have. The mackerel hook and line fishery is important for the inshore sector. I note the position outlined by the Deputies in their motion. I have asked Bord Iascaigh Mhara to engage and look at how we can add value further to the hook and line sector so that it is a premium product. We are monitoring, on an ongoing basis, how we can manage the hook and line fishery in a way that best works for inshore fishers. It is an important step forward. As the Deputies know, I visited piers and harbours throughout the country and engaged directly with fishermen on the pier and with inshore fishermen. The thing that came up at all piers, from Urris to Kilmore Quay and everywhere in between, when I took up my role as Minister, was the need to work on and get the spurdog fishery open. I am glad to say I secured that at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in December. For the first time in more than ten years, we have a spurdog fishery. It is an important step forward.The reopening in December by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of the north-west herring fishery was an important step forward. It is an important fishery for the inshore sector and fishers know its value. We will try to build on that. I launched a new consultation in recent days on how to manage this fishery. Engaging in this consultation will be important for inshore fishers in particular. Regarding financial supports, last year I put the Brexit fisheries model adjustment scheme together following the task force. The inshore sector does not normally fish quota species, so Brexit's impact on quotas was not as great on the inshore sector, but we put together a Brexit package for the sector that delivered €2,700 for small inshore boats and €4,000 in direct cash aid to other inshore boats. That was significant. I will be continuing this work in-----

They have been left behind in many ways. The Minister spoke for ten minutes, but he did not say whether he would accede to our request for €12 million for inshore fishers in our coastal communities. They are on their knees. The situation has been spelled out for the Minister. For example, the season for shrimp fishing is September to March. Since September, the situation worsened badly because there was no market in Spain, Portugal and other tourist destinations. The price was bad and there was no market in the end. Since mid-October, there has been storm after storm and wind after wind, and many fishers have either been unable to fish or have only been able to fish poorly. Their window of opportunity was short. They ceased fishing from 1 December because there was no market. We are asking the Government for €12 million to tide them over and try to keep them going. Every other sector, including in other countries, is being looked after well by their respective governments, but our fishers are being left behind. They are an integral part of coastal communities. If they do not make a few bob, shops, local pubs and local restaurants will also be left behind. We have to accept that our inshore fishers are affected by the major increase in the cost of fuel and that they cannot get VAT back. The Government will blame the war for the fuel costs and the loss of the market, but we are calling on the State for financial assistance of €12 million to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the crisis. Smaller piers are being neglected. I can think of those that are local to me, starting on the Kenmare side and going all the way along to Templenoe, Blackwater, Tahilla, Rossdohan, Oysterbed, Sneem, Gleesk and so forth. On the other side are the piers at Coornagillagh, Kilmakilloge, Lauragh and Castletownbere. There are many small fishers in those areas who are trying to improvise and keep going. They are getting no social welfare payments and are working by doing small bits of farming or building. Fishing was an integral part of their incomes, but it is lost to them completely now. The Minister says he comes from a place much like the ones we represent. These people have boats of less than 12 m in length at between 16 ft and 18 ft. I think of people like Mr. Frank Riney, Mr. Michael Clamper, Joe Jim at Blackwater and the O'Sheas of Rossdohan. There are two sets of O'Sheas there – Mike and Donal. There are also the O'Briens in Sneem. These people try hard. Their work is dangerous. I used to work on the roads along the bay and I often asked why they were out on bad days when the wind was blowing and the rain was down. I was told those were the best days to get more fish. Large trawlers come up the bay in Kenmare. The Government says it is involved in the protection of smaller vessels, but what is it doing when two large trawlers sail up either side of the bay with nets across it to clean everything out? I raised this matter at the Oireachtas committee a few months ago. What will the Government do to stop this from happening? It is unfair. These trawlers are taking everything, which means we have had no mackerel. Many people have told me there has been no mackerel this year. I remember fishers from Macroom, Innishannon and so on calling to the bar with buckets of mackerel. They would throw out a few and they were grand, but there has been no sign of them in recent years because there has been no mackerel. The bay is being cleaned out. We hear about large factory ships landing at Dingle Harbour. They are so large that 12 forklifts can work on them at the same time. We are told they are from different countries, so there is no accountability and they cannot be taxed. We are even told of Chinese factory ships, and we know what harm the Chinese are doing beyond factory ships. Fishers at Cahersiveen and other piers are being impacted. I call on the Government. Please, it is looking after every other section of the community, including other nationalities, well, but we are leaving these people behind. We have to look after them. They are an integral part of our coastal communities. They are important to the likes of the Lake House, the Blackwater Tavern and Helen's Pub in Kilmakilloge, which is run so well by Ms Helen Moriarty and her staff. These people and local shops depend on fishers surviving. I respectfully appeal to the Government to come down when its members are asked to. The Minister says he is from a coastal community, and he is. He must look after coastal communities – his own people – no matter what the Green Party or anyone else says. This is his time. He is the Minister in charge of these small fishers. I respectfully appeal to him to look after them. This is an important issue. We are the only group to table a motion like this one. I must highlight the state of the two roads on either side of Kenmare Bay. The road to Lauragh is crisscrossed by trees, which fish lorries are hitting.West of Blackwater Bridge, the other road is a state. If an articulated truck went around a car, the car would be under it. Then a few miles back the road we can see where 2 km of a footpath and cycleway was put in but there is no cycleway leading to this new cycle path or out of it. It makes no sense in the world. People lose their lives there and there are crashes there every day. It is so important that we have a safe road for these vehicles. I am glad when I see these big lorries going up to the village carrying fish. It is because we are producing something. In the few seconds I have left, I want to thank Star Seafoods and the McCarthys for the employment it has provided over the years. There is a new generation there now and the company is looking the local people and trying to employ people. The cost of fish and the scarcity of it at the present time is impacting on that. We must ensure that places like that are kept going. We have been hit badly enough as it is, but if we lose the people who are involved in working in inshore fishing, our communities will be completely doomed.

It has been my honour and privilege to work alongside Deputy Collins, particularly over the last three years. We have relentlessly raised the plight of our fishing communities in this Chamber, in the committees and out there in the wider community. I look forward to working with Deputy Collins over the time ahead. He is very passionate about our fishing communities. We produced a document a number of years ago. At the time I toured pretty much all the piers and harbours around the coast. As the Sinn Féin spokesperson, I continue to talk to fishermen every day of my life. I have appealed to the Minister again and again to listen to our fishing communities. Like me, he is from the Inishowen peninsula and is surrounded by piers and harbours. He is in the perfect position to be briefed and advised by them. From the Inishowen peninsula round the west of Donegal down to Killybegs and right round our coast, it is the Minister's responsibility to act on what they are telling us. What they are telling us is that they are staring out at the Irish exclusive economic zone, which stretches out for 200 miles in front of them. It is a huge resource and a potential creator of wealth and jobs for those fishing and coastal communities. However, due to the failures of our Government over the years in the Common Fisheries Policy, we have not seen the proper return of our own natural resource that is right in front of us. The Minister knows that from the community he is from in the Inishowen peninsula. That has been a profound failure. I want to emphasise the very important comments that Deputy Collins made. None of us is buying into the idea of divide and conquer. I was given good advice from a fisherman in the west of Ireland when I started as the Sinn Féin spokesperson on fisheries and the marine. He advised me to be careful not to buy into the idea of big versus small fishermen and divide and conquer. He told me to fight for all of them and do what is right and fair by all of them, so I support the exclusion of larger boats from the six-mile limit. I support a fairer share of mackerel, herring, spurdog and, indeed, arguably exclusively bluefin tuna if we can ever get one bloody fish to take back, rather than having to release it again. I ask the Minister to think about it. Bluefin tuna is the one of most lucrative, if not the most lucrative, species of fish in the world today. It is now accepted by the Marine Institute and the Department that it is in abundance in our waters, yet Irish fishermen have to catch and release. They take tourists out, catch the fish, which is, by the way, feeding on our own fish, and release it. It is a predatory fish. It gets fattened up. All the countries of Europe and the world are catching these fish within our exclusive economic zone, and outside in international waters after they have been fattened here. We have not even got one fish. The allocation to the EU of bluefin tuna increased by something like 75% in recent years because the species is doing well again, but we can only catch them on a rod and release them. Imagine the extra wealth that could bring to inshore fishermen. There is over-reliance on crab, lobster and other shellfish. Having to rely on them is not going to be a future for our inshore fishermen. The Minister knows that and has been told that.  I want to welcome some good news. I will be fair with these points. The spurdog issue was a crucial one. Everywhere I went, particularly in meeting the inshore fleet on the smaller piers right down the west of Ireland and round into the south east, mention was made of getting access to spurdog. It is good and welcome news that that quota has been secured. I ask for more of that. I want to welcome the fact that the National Inshore Fisherman's Association, NIFA, is now a producer organisation. That is welcome, but I am going to throw a challenge back to the Minister. It is really important that we include the islands in this motion. We must stand up for the fishermen of the islands. We must take the island and inshore fishermen all together. As the Minister knows, the island fishermen and the inshore fishermen now have producer organisations. Now that they both have producer organisations, it is critical that they have a place at the table because mackerel and herring quota are public quota and they need to have a fair share. Killybegs has built up a pelagic industry through hard work over many years. We have to fight for the fair share of pelagic fish. The Minister is aware of the issue with blue whiting and I believe he has been working with the industry on that. I am very critical of the failure of the Government over decades now. The words used by Deputy Nolan are very strong ones, but I must say that if we speak to fishermen, that is how they feel and those are the words they use. I am sorry to say it, but those are the words they use about the Department. They are really angry. They call it the "Department Against the Marine". The Minister is from a fishing community in Inishowen. I believe that some of the things he has done recently are very welcome, but we have to do more. The Minister has people in his party and from his party in the recent past in Donegal who are passionate about the fishing industry, who would be brilliant people to advise him. The Minister should listen to them. Perhaps he is starting to listen to them because there is some positive stuff happening here. As long as the Minister takes positive actions and fights for fishermen, he will have my support and the support of the Deputies present. However, if we continue to see a Department that is against the marine, that fails people in the way that it has, then we will stand up and challenge the Government. We will repeat the language that we hear in our communities. It is our job to listen to what is happening out there and to hold Government to account and to ask it to do what is right.  The final issue that I want to touch on is that of fuel. The Government failed to provide financial support to the fishing industry that was severely impacted by the fuel crisis. The Minister said that the industry had the tie up scheme. That was totally wrong, because the scheme was about providing support for the loss of quota as a result of Brexit, a totally separate issue. The industry was getting supports for the loss of quota. The inshore fleet had no tie up scheme. It got no financial supports whatsoever throughout this period of huge challenge. As we outlined in our alternative budget, I support the provision of a financial allocation, particularly from the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, EMFAF. That is European money that is available. I understand that as we speak, there is €5 million sitting there to be allocated. I appeal to the Minister again to support the proposition, as outlined, for the allocation of €12 million from a range of different sources, including European funding, directly to the industry. The inshore industry in particular got no supports, but the overall industry needs supports too. The Minister started off his speech by talking about what surrounds him and the piers and how they have influenced him. I am asking him, in his final period in government, to continue with some of the welcome measures announced in recent days, to stand up for inshore fishermen and all fishermen, and to get what is fair for our country in the EU.

That is not surprising, seeing as I come from County Mayo, where we have many coastal communities. Those communities are in places such as Erris, Achill, Clare Island, Ballycastle, Porturlin and right along the coast. One of the major concerns they have had for years is that they have had to stand and watch as massive trawlers raid their fish. Those trawlers show complete disregard for their own workers. I have just come from a presentation in the audiovisual room at which the workers on those boats described the slave-like conditions in which they have to work. These trawlers also show absolute disregard for the marine ecosystems. The fishermen and their forefathers have watched out for the ecosystem and for generations have protected those ecosystems. Their hands are now tied while they watch their fish being given away. There is now high unemployment in fishing communities. They are experiencing real difficulties. Those fishermen are watching their natural resources being given away. It is no wonder these communities feel they have been neglected by consecutive governments. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement that came out of Brexit merely served as the most recent example of the Government selling out the Irish fishing communities. The Irish Government failed to put up any real fight to secure a fair share of the opportunities with other EU member states as part of that agreement. We need increased access to fish in our waters to enable us to sustain and grow rural coastal communities. Inshore fishing happens within six nautical miles of the coast and yet it makes up over 90% of the entire fishing fleet of registered Irish vessels and comprises the large majority of those directly employed in the sector. The importance of inshore fisheries in sustaining coastal communities cannot be overstated. It is estimated that 2,500 to 3,000 jobs, livelihoods and families are supported in that sector. These are important jobs for the communities in the areas I come from. Those communities can never hope for large multinational corporations to come to their areas. They depend on inshore fishing. They have been hit by Brexit, Covid-19, increased fuel costs, reduced markets and ongoing unequal access to fishing opportunities. The Minister needs to listen to the inshore fishing sector and put right what has been wrong for years.

I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion. I thank an Teachta Michael Collins and his colleagues for the work they have done. I also commend my colleague, an Teachta Mac Lochlainn, the Sinn Féin spokesperson in this area, for his efforts in engaging with the Irish fishing community in recent years. He visited Waterford last year and we met with fishermen in Helvick, Ardmore, Dungarvan and Dunmore East. We listened carefully to what those fishermen and fisherwomen had to say. I will home in on a few issues in my constituency of Waterford. I have raised all of these issues with the Minister previously but they have not been resolved. The first issue is that the landing rights for British and northern registered vehicles in Dunmore were removed in December 2020 following the Brexit trade and co-operation deal. I have raised the issue with the Minister, as have an Teachta Mac Lochlainn and some of my constituency colleagues, and there has still been no progress. Why has there been no progress? The most recent response I received from a parliamentary question on the issue suggested that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, is still examining the matter. In God's name, how long does it take to examine the matter? We are talking about people's livelihoods and the opportunity to invest in a harbour and a coastal fishing community. These landings provide a significant economic boost to the village of Dunmore. I ask the Minister to look again at that issue. I have also raised with the Minister the issue of vacant apartment buildings in Dunmore East. Some of those buildings have gone through tendering processes but they are still not being used. What is being done about that? It makes no sense whatsoever. When I visit villages such as Dunmore, Passage East, Cheekpoint, Dungarvan and Helvick, and talk to fishermen in those areas, they ask me why they cannot fish. We held a successful public meeting in Waterford last year that was attended by approximately 400 people. One of those who attended was a well-known Dunmore fisherman named Jimmy Byrnes. He passionately addressed the meeting and set out the importance of fishing and the pride he and his fellow fishermen have in their communities and those traditions. He was standing up for his heritage and that of many others. If the people in the Department had half as much passion as Mr. Byrnes and many others, we would have a far better fishing industry and better coastal communities than we currently have.

I commend the work that is going on and the work of our spokesperson, Deputy Mac Lochlainn. It does not require intimate knowledge of the fishing industry to understand the injustice that has long been foisted on fishing communities across the State and the missed opportunities that exist, particularly in the context of the much greater popularity of seafood. There is no doubt that issue must be addressed. There is an incredibly long tradition and history in fisheries. The industry is of vital importance to communities. I wish to address a somewhat niche issue with the Minister, but opportunities to address it are rare. The issue relates to fishermen and fisherwomen who are involved in inland fisheries. I am thinking in particular of Cork Harbour. The issue falls under the responsibility of a number of Departments, primarily the Department of Social Protection, which is something of an anomaly. Unfortunately, the issue of inland fisheries is seen by the Department of Social Protection in the context of tourism, angling and so on. Those are valuable things which bring value to local communities. There is, however, a tradition in large harbours, such as Cork Harbour, and in villages such as Passage West, where families involved in the industry include the Murphys and Howards, including Mr. Jack Howard. People in those areas have been fishing for many generations. The same is true of the Coholan family in Blackrock and others like them. These are communities in which fishing was once a very large industry, but because of the development of Cork Harbour and other things, it has diminished. These are primarily draft net fisherman who are very low as a priority. The say they have with the Inland Fisheries Board is very limited because the focus is on angling. Some of these fishing crews would go from inland to inshore. I urge the Minister to use whatever scope he has to raise the matter with his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, and try to give a greater voice to these communities. Culturally and historically, they are similar to the inshore fishermen. They are trying to make a living but it is difficult because the quotas are so low and there are issues involved. They understand the science and want to be a part of the solution. They want to work with Inland Fisheries Ireland. This is a tradition with long roots and it would be a shame to see it eliminated entirely. Few of these fishermen and fisherwomen are left. Cork Harbour is one place where they remain. There are also a few other small places on the lakes and at inshore areas on the coastline. It is important the two Departments work with these inland fishers and draft net fishermen to support their ongoing businesses.

It is absolutely necessary that we have these conversations. I have no doubt that many others have had the same conversations I have had with fishers in respect of ensuring the sustainability of their industry. I know the Minister has also had engagement. He knows the issues. No more than when we talk about farming and the family farm, the main thing is to ensure the sustainability of the industry and wider fishing communities. I am thinking about the likes of Clogherhead and Carlingford and those who are involved in fishing around my home town of Dundalk. In recent times, we have all heard the anger that exists at what has happened post Brexit.We all know many wrongs were committed under the Common Fisheries Policy over many years in relation to the access Irish fishermen did not have to waters that were rightfully theirs and to quotas that, at least in part, were rightfully theirs. This has had a long-term impact on the industry. Many fishermen have spoken of the necessity for supports to keep the industry going rather than trying to decommission or end it. These are the things we need to do. The Rural Independent Group put it fairly straight. This is straightforward. There is a need to put in €12 million. We are talking about European support funds and the EMFAF and about ensuring it gets into the hands of those involved in the industry. There are huge qualms concerning money lost through administration. I accept the need for administration but we need to look at this. There are major issues here. We all accept that those involved in the fishing industry have been drawn the short straw over many years. We need to rectify that. We need fairness. They cannot take up all the slack. In the Brexit negotiations, once again it was their back on which many deals were done. We need to equalise the playing field and there is a requirement for the Minister to do that. 
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-25 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	41	I thank the Rural Independents for this motion, which we will support. I come from a land-locked county but it does not take much analysis to know fishermen in our country have been let down. I have met people from west Cork and south Kerry, where I have many connections, as well as west Clare and further up the west coast. We are seeing negative change and you would feel for them. The inshore fleet comprises around 91% of our fishing vessels, employing close to 3,000 people in rural communities. What gets to me when I talk to these groups, as I have over a number of years going back to when I was an MEP, is the involvement of many intergenerational families. I accept the Minister’s interest in the area, but I see that involvement dwindling all the time. That is hugely unfortunate. The Irish seafood sector has been under enormous pressure with Brexit and strain from other issues, including what is going on with Ukraine. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has also had a disproportionate impact on our seafood. Our fleet loss is 15% of its annual quota. Exports of ingredients and supplies to the UK have been hugely disrupted and the UK land bridge, which would be the fastest route to market in continental Europe, is less viable, to say the least. The impact can be seen, in particular, on the shrimp market, which has effectively collapsed, with one group of around 600 small inshore fishers losing an estimated €5 million in the build-up to Christmas last year. Packages valued at more than €100 million have been provided to help the larger offshore sector to deal with the ongoing negative impacts of Brexit; unfortunately, the inshore sector has only received around €3.7 million, despite accounting for 91% of the fishing fleet. As recommended by the seafood task force set up by the Minister, one payment of €2,700 for owners of vessels under 8 m and €4,000 for owners of large vessels were made but it is not enough.  EMFAF implements the EU Common Fisheries Policy and aims to boost the resilience of the seafood sector, accelerate its green transition and support coastal communities. The total finance allocation is €258.4 million. A slight issue with the motion, which I think is a typo, is the figure “€285.4 million”, which should be “€258.4 million”, comprising an EU contribution of €142.4 million and €116 million from the State. Some 50% of this funding allocation is to be dedicated to building resilience to current challenges in the fisheries sector and improving sustainability, which we all know is necessary. Despite a 114% increase in fuel prices between 2020 and mid-2022, Government has repeatedly refused to draw down on EU fuel aid. Data from BIM shows Irish fisheries require between €20 million and €25 million in fuel aid to effectively compete in Europe. Fleets from countries whose governments have distributed existing fuel aid or are offering other fuel aid supports are being given a competitive advantage over the Irish fleet.  The European Commission has allowed for derogation of fuel subsidies, which has been capitalised on by France and Spain, for example, but the Minister has so far refused to grant such relief to our fishermen. I would appreciate if he would deal with this matter in his reply. I was taken with his statement that €50 million was given out to a range of areas across the country, a massive increase on previous years, which I accept. A number of locations did not apply, as the Minister pointed out. Is that still open or will it be reopened? In many cases, those who did not apply need to do so, as the Minister stressed. Will he answer that in his reply? Ireland’s fishing fleet has an excellent reputation but the viability of the vast majority of the fleet is now in question. We have heard from numerous organisations, such as the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, IFPO, and NIFA, as well as individual fisheries, that whether or not the sector survives depends on direct and targeted support. I have no doubt there are avenues, nationally and particularly through the EU, that need more focus and we in the Labour Party will concentrate on that. It is important to keep in mind this concerns the livelihoods of those working from small inlets, piers and harbours around our coasts and they face a really difficult period if there is not direct help given soon.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has recently formally recognised NIFA as an EU producer organisation. This is a welcome move. I think we all support it but it is tokenistic if greater support is not given and we do not get to the heart of the issue. Our inshore fishing fleet needs immediate targeted financial aid, both current and capital. If a plan is not put in place soon for this group, which does not get as much attention in this Chamber as it should, it faces a difficult future. Please act.

Despite being the largest segment of our fishing sector and providing the most employment, it is too often overlooked. This is a timely discussion as the National Inshore Fishermen's Association has finally, thanks to its members’ tireless efforts, achieved producer organisation status. I was delighted to be able to assist them in this process, and acknowledgement is also due to the Minister for his support. However, despite this good news, overall inshore fishing has been neglected by this and previous governments. In terms of vessels, people employed, distribution, and cultural heritage, it is the most significant part of the fishing industry. Despite this, Government policy and, crucially, quota distribution vastly favours larger vessels and the bigger players.  As I have continuously raised, this is a highly unequal system designed and enforced by the Minister and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Last week we discussed the new office of food regulation and the vulnerability of primary producers to exploitation. Unfortunately, in the case of inshore fishing it is the Government which is imposing unfair trading practices by limiting the capacity of the sector.The clearest example of this appalling disparity is the mackerel quota. Currently, only 2% of this quota is assigned to vessels under 15 m, while 98% is given to a small number of larger boats. To be clear, more than 2,000 boats get only 2%, while fewer than 100 larger boats get 98% of that share. In June 2021, this meagre quota was reached for that year, meaning fishers who were just getting by, were not permitted to catch even a few dozen mackerel for sale at the likes of a farmers’ market or to local restaurants. I raised this issue on behalf of the inshore fishers at the time, but almost two years later nothing has changed. Even more worrying is that the Minister does not even acknowledge this is an issue. When I raised it with the Minister last April, he stated:At the moment, that sector, which is extremely sustainable, viable and important, gets 400 tonnes per year. A few years ago, it did not get any.I do not know any inshore fishers who would agree with that assessment. This sector is screaming out for a fairer allocation of quotas and targeted supports. The Government could assign them ten times their current mackerel quota and it still would not be fair. I strongly support this motion’s call for “a greater quota allocation with diversification to other species”. A more equitable and realistic distribution of our quotas is required, especially as some of them are impacted by Brexit. For too long, a small number of big players have dominated the sector. Allocations must be taken from them and given to the majority of fishers who are practising a more sustainable type of fishing. Inshore fishers are being hit by the same skyrocketing costs as other food producers, yet they are not getting the same attention. Fuel costs, insurance and bait prices are combining to make a tough situation even harder. Reflecting the structural barriers faced by this sector, many of the Government support schemes for the fishing industry in recent years have outright or de facto excluded inshore vessels. For example, the Brexit inshore fisheries business model adjustment scheme, which was designed to help inshore fishers adjust to the post-Brexit context, was based on a threshold of activity during the first six months of 2021. However, this disregarded the majority of vessels that are under 8 m in west Cork and other areas that are involved in seasonal fisheries. With the challenges faced by many fishers, seasonal work is common. Lobster, velvet crab, scallops and brown crab are fished from July and August, outside the period which counted under the Brexit scheme. This exclusion is even more clear for inshore shrimp fishery, which by law can only begin on 1 August. The Minister has to appreciate the frustration in the industry when faced with barriers such as this. Schemes are announced with much fanfare, but when fishers actually get to read the terms and conditions, they quickly realise they are barred from the funding. Well-maintained marine infrastructure is vital for inshore fishers. They depend on small piers and slipways dotted around the coast and on offshore islands. However, many of these in west Cork and elsewhere are falling into disrepair and lack the most basic amenities. The seafood task force recommended an investment of €80 million over five years into public marine infrastructure. While I welcome the €35 million from the Brexit adjustment reserve for this purpose, this is a once-off investment. There was and is a glaring need for greater multi-annual funding. The seafood task force has provided a clear standard of another €45 million. Regrettably, when I asked a parliamentary question about the budget for 2023, the Minister informed me he was not providing any funding and instead directed me to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. As the Minister knows, it can take years to get a foreshore licence. Anything in respect of which funding is applied for and which also needs a foreshore licence will not get it because it has to be shovel ready. We desperately need to look at the licensing system there, because other countries started from six miles out or one mile out, rather than from the coastline. It is counterintuitive in terms of trying to create more environmental practices. Every time I raise this issue, I am referred from one Department to another and back again. All the time, the need for investment is not being provided. I have welcomed the news that the National Inshore Fisheries Forum has been recognised as a producer organisation, PO. With this status, it will receive support for its operating costs and the preparation of reports and plans. From the experience of other inshore fishers, there is a clear need for set-up costs also to be funded. There is a steep learning curve and a need for increased capacity on becoming a producer organisation. Will the Minister look into the provision of specific once-off investment for new POs to help them become established? Perhaps it has changed since I last was at a meeting with the islands PO that became a PO months before this one. It was saying it still had not received any kind of funding. Maybe I am wrong and it has since, but it seems like there is a big delay in it being able to carry out its duties as a PO once it gets that status. There is the ongoing issue of trawling in inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone. It is having a very negative impact on inshore fishers’ livelihoods, not to mention the knock-on effects on marine activities and the environmental toll that takes. This matter remains with the courts. I have asked the Minister to start the process again to establish another policy directive, which at this stage would have taken less time than the legal route. It is unbelievable that it was only overturned on a technicality, but it is still in place and these harmful practices are still being carried out. The outcome of the judicial review outlines the issues with the original process. Rectify them by establishing a new directive and solve this matter once and for all. I encourage the Minister, and I raised this issue with the Tánaiste last week, to look at existing by-laws because there was pair trawling going on in west Cork last week. It seems there is a by-law, for example, in Bantry Bay, that prevents that practice. This motion has provided much-needed Dáil time to focus on the inshore sector. In any discussions of our food systems, this is one of the most neglected areas. Unfortunately, this reflects the importance assigned to the sector by the Government. There are thousands of inshore fishers in coastal and island communities across Ireland. In west Cork, they are deeply valued as part of our local economy, providing jobs and fresh seafood for hotels, restaurants and takeaways. They are also part of our marine heritage. This sector is essential to the viability of offshore islands and coastal towns, villages and communities. The Government needs to live up to its commitment to support this sector, quotas need to be distributed proportionately, targeted supports suited to the inshore conditions must be provided, and we need sustained investment in public marine infrastructure. Inshore fishers are continuing to face mounting challenges. There is a glaring need for fairer policies and proper supports. The Government must act.

It did so under the Minister’s guidance. When he came down to Union Hall and was having nice meals, or whatever he said, he advised the council to apply for scoping and feasibility funding, which it did, and the Department refused it. The Minister needs to correct the record. The council will be writing to the Minister about this matter, because he made a very serious allegation, and against my brother, but we are thick-skinned and we will not be worried about that. The Minister needs to correct the record of the Dáil and say that is the case. Other funding has also been applied for in the area and the Department has refused that.

Many of those who are speaking are from the west and the south, where coastal communities and people working in fishing are being severely impacted by rising energy costs, the cost-of-living crisis, the impact of Brexit and so on. However, it may surprise people to know, because it is not talked about as much, that on the east coast there are also many people whose livelihoods depend directly or indirectly on inshore fishing. I was talking this morning to the fishermen who work out of Dún Laoghaire. They have done a survey recently and are estimating that, between the border on the east coast and Kilmore Quay, approximately 800 people are employed directly or indirectly in the fishing industry. Not to put too fine a point on it, they see themselves as fighting for their survival. They believe on a number of fronts that, because of the failure of the Government to support them, their future is very much in jeopardy and indeed that they might be completely wiped out as an industry. That is their view for a number of reasons.The motion, and the appeal of inshore fishermen, relate to the immediate issues of the cost-of-living crisis, the hike in energy prices and the collapse of the shrimp market. On those fronts, the fishermen I talked to detailed how severe the various impacts are. Marine diesel, which used to cost about 30 cent a litre, increased in price to about 65 cent per litre and now costs about 110 cent per litre. The cost of a lobster pot, which was about €45, has increased to about €70, while the cost of shrimp pots has risen by about 50%. In overall costs, they say the cost just of going out to fish for the day has increased by between 75% and 100%. They say it used to cost them about €100 per day just to go out to work, but that that cost has now increased to between €150 and €200. They are being hammered. They need the aid package they are requesting and there should be no procrastination by the Government. They also say they are not interested in this tie-up scheme and, in fact, they think it is part of an agenda to wipe them out. They do not want to be tied up or to be paid to do so. They want to fish and they want assistance to sustain their livelihoods. The other pressure these fishermen are under, which is a little bit off the topic of the motion but which they asked me to raise, relates to the impact of the so-called relevant projects or industrial wind schemes for the Kish and Codling banks, their key fishing grounds. They are very much in favour of developing offshore wind and renewable energy and they understand their importance, but they say the developer-led model, which is leading to these so-called legacy projects being dictated by the developers to put on the Kish and Codling banks, will wipe them out. They say it will destroy them completely. They tell me these companies are riding roughshod over them and that it is severely impacting on them. If these industrial wind farms are built on those locations, which should have been marine protected areas and which contain very sensitive sandbanks that are key to their livelihoods, their industry, jobs and livelihoods will be wiped out. That is contrary to all sorts of EU directives that prohibit displacement as a result of the development of these much-needed wind farms for the renewable energy we need. I emphasise they are severely needed, but they are not supposed to displace existing livelihoods, which is exactly what is happening because developers are dictating. What is going on is absolutely outrageous. The Government is facilitating the sort of developer-led madness that led to the Celtic tiger crash, and now we are seeing the same model of development being repeated in our marine area, with the fishermen paying the price. Moreover, they say the consequence of that will be disastrous for biodiversity and point out that those banks protect the east coast. The damage to our coastal environment will be devastating if hundreds of wind turbines are put on these sensitive banks, which protect the east coast and provide a livelihood for our fishermen. They say we do need offshore wind but not on areas that should be protected from the points of view of biodiversity, marine biology and the protection of the livelihoods of fishers and those who work downstream in the industry and depend on those fishers. I will support the motion. I ask the Minister to respond positively to the request of inshore fishermen and to listen to what they are saying about the potential devastation that will be inflicted on fishers on the east coast and in all the other areas throughout the country that have been spoken about.

I thank the Rural Independent Group and will support its motion. It reads "all fishers, including the inshore fishermen, have been hit extremely hard by record high fuel cost increases, while bait prices have also ‘soared’ (mainly due to almost all bait now being imported) as larger whitefish vessels have taken advantage of tie-up schemes". We all know that the rising fuel costs have burdened many sectors in our society, but those in the fishing fleet are wholly reliant on going out to fish to make ends meet. The alternative to this is to cease operating, which, unfortunately, many are choosing to do. Those who rely on going out to fish cannot avoid the fuel crisis by working from home, switching to public transport or buying a new electric vessel. The choices that might be available to onshore workers to avoid the additional costs are simply not there for the fishing communities. This is why tax breaks or supports to a slightly larger degree than those for other sectors would be appropriate. The motion also highlights the fact small fishermen are facing annihilation, a problem that was exacerbated by the Government, which has decided that the simplest solution to deal with the loss of the Irish fishing quota is to decommission the whitefish fleet. This scenario sums up the Government's approach to the fishing sector, as well as that of previous governments. The political will just is not there to stick up for the interests of Irish fishers when it comes to negotiations. The fallback solution appears to be the notion that we can pay off the fishermen. I am pleased the motion highlights the reality of many of the deals the Government has agreed to at EU level, and there is no doubt our membership of the EU brings many benefits to sectors of the Irish economy, but it seems that at least one exception to this is the fishing community. The motion highlights some of the reality when it states "Irish boat owners are forced to sit in the harbour and watch as their EU neighbours from France and Spain land fish from Irish waters in Irish harbours, while benefiting from a fuel subsidy implemented by their governments on the back of a derogation given by the European Commission". Imagine how soul-destroying this must be for Irish boat owners and fishers, struggling on the margins or toeing the line between staying afloat and going out of business, to see this type of thing happening and being allowed to continue to happen. With all that in mind, the motion calls for increased Government supports for the inshore fishing sector and for such a support scheme to be processed speedily and conveniently to increase quotas. I agree with the proposers of the motion in their calls for action and I hope the Minister is listening such that the Government will put a plan in place to support those in the inshore fishing community. I received an email earlier this month that relates to some of the commentary the Minister made in his opening remarks. I stood on the pier in Kilmore Quay with him and his visit was very much appreciated, but he might recall that the anger in the community, which depends entirely on fishing, was palpable. It has a processing plant and all the restaurants and hotels in Kilmore have a reputation for having fresh fish caught by their own local fishermen. I received that email on 9 January from a fisherman in Kilmore. He stated that, because the decommissioning scheme had been in the news lately, he wanted to outline the views of fishermen. He explained that a figure for compensation is calculated based on the tonnage of the boat, the quantity of fish caught and the age of the boat.This presumably is to compensate fishermen for the loss of their income and way of life forever. This should not be confused with the temporary tie-up scheme which has run for the last two years as compensation for our reduced quotas due to Brexit. The decommissioning and temporary tie-up schemes are separate and the tie-up money should not be deducted from the decommissioning money. The decommissioning scheme is a disaster for costal communities. It is a cop-out by the Government which has failed miserably to get a fair share for our fishers, even in our own waters. Since 1983, we have 2.9% of that quota for sole in area F and G. In brackets, he says that the south coast of Ireland to Lands' End is what that area covers. Belgium has 63% which is a disparity of over 60% to the advantage of Belgium. Ireland has 7% of the monkfish while France has 57% and Belgium again are up on Ireland at 8%. If we had a fair share of the quotas, there would be no need for a decommissioning scheme and the State would save some €60 million. If there is a big take-up, the industry will get very small and will not be able to sustain many of the back-up industries such as processing, engineering and transport. I think we can add tourism and serious tourism particularly in costal areas to that. The value of restaurants having fresh fish every day is particularly what enhances people's experience and brings them into the community. He continues to state in his email that a much better scheme would be to continue the contemporary tie-up for one month every year. In line with what we have been discussing, and again it is the Minister's Department albeit a different junior Minister, is the issue of Coillte and decommissioning. We are selling off the family silver or at least that is what it looks like in rural Ireland and I know the Minister is from a costal community. Why would Coillte be selling our lands? Something that was brought to my attention this morning is very relevant because this is about rural Ireland and it is also about rural communities. The Minister has the power to change the forest premium because it has not been sanctioned by the EU. Some €100 million in forest premiums would be leaving the country annually and I am told the Minister can reduce this to the investors with which Coillte seems to have a done deal. What is being suggested, and I very much back the suggestion, is that he would reduce the premium to the investors and increase it to the farmers which would incentivise farm forestry and at the very least we would retain ownership of our lands. Decommissioning is the same thing. We are selling the family silver. When our Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, appointed a third Minister in a Dublin Central constituency, it was a rejection of rural Ireland and the calls we put on the floor like this.

I thank Deputy Collins and his colleagues for raising this and I fully support it. They have highlighted the crisis the industry is in and the urgent need. They have identified a figure which is very different in the scheme of money given out by the Government often unaccounted for and without transparency and accountability coming back. The Minister's comments to the effect that it is the first time a group has brought a Private Members' Bill is not helpful because small groups can only bring Private Members' Bills on an irregular, let us say, very intermittent basis. If I use myself as an example, I have brought Bills or motions on seaweed and on a policy for the islands. Nothing has happened and they are all interlinked, of course. We have had one on wool which is interlinked again with local industry and the viability of costal communities and also on seaweed, fishing and a policy for the islands. None of them has materialised, not one, and we are waiting. I welcome the positives first before I go on to analyse where I see the difficulties with the Government. I welcome the announcement that there is a National Inshore Fishermen's Association which is recognised as a producer organisation. The value of that will depend on its total independence from the Department and its total independence in relation to resourcing. I hope that producer organisation does not have the distinction of standing over the death of fishing in our costal areas. I hope that is not the outcome. The motion is particularly well laid out. It sets out the matter in detail and I thank Deputy Collins for that. I want to focus on the very good policy by the Government back in 2018 to ban trawlers over 18 m from the inshore; a wonderful policy. It has already been referred to by Deputy Cairns but the update has not been given at all. Very quickly, the Government brought in a very good policy. A transition period was given for the bigger trawlers regarding sprat which were given a two or three-year window to get out of the inshore waters and unfortunately a case is taken to the High Court by a number of big boat owners. They win on a technicality being that the communication process was not as it should be. Fast forward to this year, the Court of Appeal's judgment held completely with the Government. I have the Court of Appeal judgment with me and I have taken the trouble to read it in detail. On 19 July 2022, the judgment held with the Government's policy utterly and completely. Can the Minister tell me today what has happened since 18 July? The only little obstacle at the bottom of that judgment was that the court asked for submissions in relation to a Northern Ireland aspect and vehicles. Otherwise, it was a complete victory for the Government. Its policy was upheld. More particularly, the Court of Appeal judgment stated that the policy directive to exclude the big trawlers from taking sprat, on the basis that it is simply not viable, was a measure of the conservation for fish stocks within the relevant regulation. The failure to notify - and that relates to the consultation process - had no effect on the validity. It was a win-win for the Government. The judgment goes on to say that the policy was not discriminatory. It was intra vires; in other words, the Government had the power to do what it did. It was not irrational. It was rational. It was legally adequate and a reasonable leader construing the consultation paper would not have concluded that the applicants who took the case enjoyed any right to a second consultation. Therefore, there is no need for a second consultation, the Government's policy has been upheld and simply seven months later we have no clarification from the Government on so important a matter which is the unsustainable removal of sprat from our inshore waters that is making it impossible for smaller fishermen to continue. If we look at the policy and what was behind it, there was a six-fold justification for it of which I will read but which included to provide wider ecosystem benefits including for nursing areas and juvenile stocks. It goes on to outline all of them stating that excluding vessels over 18 m from trawling inside the 6 nautical mile zone would present a significant economic opportunity to smaller inshore vessels. The increase in availability of sprat, and possibly of herring, to smaller vessels would represent a significant diversification opportunity for these smaller vessels. There were potential knock-on benefits for other economic sectors if the restrictions were introduced which is what the Government was doing back in December 2018. Finally, the restrictions ultimately reflected that the policy directive would go some way to addressing the issue of gear conflict and the loss of the static fishing gear used by smaller vessels as a consequence of net trawling by larger boats. The background and the evidence given, which was not challenged by the Government, was that the number of vessels in the 12 m to 18 m fleet in Ireland is very low and continues to decline reflecting the very difficult environment in which these small boats operate, which is the whole substance of this motion before us. There is a compelling case for excluding trawling activity by large vessels in coastal waters inside the 6 nautical miles. There are sufficient opportunities for these vessels outside of the 6 nautical miles.On and on it goes and it talks about the importance of small fishermen earning a living that is sustainable in small vessels in a sustainable way. That is what this motion is about. What really worries me is the kind of quick retort and I can see why the Minister might retort to some of the language used but that is neither here nor there. The duty is on the Government to come forward to tell us what it is doing in policy and in an action plan so that we have sustainable coastal communities based upon seaweed, which is the most fantastic product that we are ignoring, until we gave it to the big boys, or to be fair, to the big girls. Wool is a completely wonderful commodity. What did we do? It was said that somebody should set up a wool council. We set a report up with fantastic recommendations, which highlights the diversity of how wool can be used and then we ignore it.  What do we do then with small vessels? We make it completely impossible for them. When we bring in a policy directive, we let it trundle on long for four years through the courts without making a damning or strong case to the court asking it to please hear this case quickly. When the court did hear it in July, it gave the Government a win. The Government is making the win into a loss because it is still allowing the big trawlers into the 6-mile area to fish unsustainably for sprat, which will feed other unsustainable fish farming activities. I have no hesitation in supporting this motion here today. I thank the Rural Independent Group again for bringing it forward.  The comments that we should bring these motions in our Private Members' time is simply not helpful. The duty is on the Government to tell us what the policy is.

He has invested in the fisherman’s pontoon in Kinsale and in a pontoon in Courtmacsherry - there have been dredging works at Courtmacsherry - that is a pontoon that is used by the inshore sector. He has invested in the lower Aghada pier, which is used by the inshore sector, and in Cunnamore pier. There was an application in from Cork County Council for works at Union Hall for a barrier, which would have cut off for pier users down in Union Hall and I am glad that that application was rejected because it would have cut off access to what we call the leisure pier at Union Hall. I am happy that was rejected by the Minister. The Minister introduced a Brexit scheme for the inshore sector, something which is not acknowledged. That original scheme was only for a six-month period and when the inshore sector approached to the Minister and asked for an extension of the scheme for the entire year, he did that and accepted it, but he will not give any acknowledgement from the Opposition on that. When I talk about the works that he had done on the piers and harbours across west Cork, he will get mud slung at him from the Opposition but they will be the first people to stand down on those piers and to put up social media posts welcoming the funding that they secured for each and every one of those piers, with absolutely no acknowledgement given to the Minister. People will, however, see through that, as will the inshore sector.  The Minister opened up the spurdog fishery.

The Minister met NIFA at my request before Christmas in response to the collapse in the shrimp market, which he did at the drop of a hat, which I welcome. They had two asks. One was that the association would secure producer organisation, PO, status and we found out this week that this has been secured. The second ask was on the shrimp market and its collapse and we asked that he would provide a support package in that regard. That is the crux of what I want to speak about here today. We need a package to support that inshore sector, which has been severely and negatively impacted by the fact that the shrimp market has collapsed, mainly in Spain where much of our shrimp goes, and where the demand and the market for that species has collapsed.  The association has produced a graph that I have to hand. I am unsure if Members can see it from here but put simply, it shows the price they were receiving for shrimp in 2021 and then in 2022. One can see there has been a severe and dramatic collapse in the market for shrimp. That is my main ask of the Minister here today. He has responded before when we have come to him looking for extensions of schemes and when we looked for investment in our piers and harbours and I am confident that he will respond when we look for a package here also. I will conclude on the subject of fuel costs, which have increased dramatically from 2018 up to 2022. My second ask of the Minister here today is that we look for a fuel subsidy for the inshore sector and, indeed, across the entire fishing industry, both inshore and offshore.

He has ensured support for the National Inshore Fisheries Forum in the developing and implementing of its own industry-led strategy to raise the profile of the inshore sector, to facilitate its engagement in policy initiatives and to enhance their understanding of management and planning for inshore fisheries. Furthermore, he has facilitated constructive discussions around industry priorities in exploring new opportunities for diversification. The inshore sector has a role in making recommendations on the allocation of Ireland’s fishing quotas and emerging policies and initiatives through representation on a number of fisheries consultative structures, including the quota management advisory committee. State bodies also provide a range of services to the inshore fleet, including advisory services and stock conservation supports.  During the lifetime of this Government, two producer organisations have been guided to achieving official recognition, which will assist in the development of the sector and market opportunities through production and marketing plans, and will also provide additional representation for inshore fishers to give them a stronger voice.  Aside from the ongoing work on protecting and expanding the fishing opportunities for the inshore sector, the Minister has also consistently provided developmental and financial supports. Under the EMFAF's seafood development programme, there has been significant investment in areas such as capital investment on vessels, grants to fishers to engage in conservation initiatives and public interest projects aimed at ensuring sustainable fishing opportunities now and in future. The recommendations of the seafood task force, which were shaped by the valuable contributions of representatives from the inshore sector, are being implemented and the Minister has included those directed at inshore fishers among the prioritised schemes. This includes the introduction of the inshore fisheries business model adjustment scheme, for which the Minister has secured €3.7 million in funding and which has resulted in direct payments to ensure fishers of between €2,700 and €4,000. In addition, the Minister’s introduction of a €1 million inshore marketing scheme will create new and better avenues for the sale of inshore species and achieve higher prices for our fishers. Meanwhile, the roll-out of a full suite of measures based on task force recommendations will provide new and diverse opportunities for those working in the inshore sector. These supports will be closely followed by the implementation of the EMFAF seafood development programme, which has included a specific and prominent focus on small-scale coastal fisheries.  As a member state of the European Union, there are necessary processes which we must engage with and regulations which we must adhere to in order to develop specific schemes and supports so that we do not interfere with the integrity of the Single Market. While the Minister has already committed to providing funding for the inshore sector through his Department’s EMFAF seafood development programme, the precise nature of these supports will need to be formulated in accordance with these rules, to include processes which have been established, and in accordance with relevant regulations for the management of EMFAF funding. It would not serve the inshore fishers to propose funding without regard for these processes and the regulations that underpin them. The best way to deliver focused and necessary funding to the sector is to work through the programme that has been adopted by the European Commission and that is exactly what the Minister has been doing. The Minister will continue to engage and will work with representatives of the inshore sector directly to identify precise needs, to develop supports that are both appropriate to the sector and in compliance with the EU regulations and guidelines and to allocate funding on a prioritised basis.

I thank our group, under Deputy Mattie McGrath. I was glad to propose this as our motion for today because of its importance. Hundreds of inshore fishermen have no income today. I am very interested in the speech the Minister made earlier. He blamed those of us in opposition for not raising the issue of inshore fishermen enough. We are raising it today. We are giving the Minister an opportunity to do what we are looking for. Our motion aims to force the Government to finally act by allocating at least €12 million in funds to inshore shrimp and velvet crab fishermen from the €258 million available for the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund. We are asking the Minister to give the fishermen money today. Backbenchers support the Minister and said he is great. Is he going to give the fishermen money? Will he announce today that he will give them money? That is what we need. I found the Minister's speech puzzling. He spoke about piers and harbours and said he had given money to piers. I would warmly welcome any money he would give to piers. In the 1990s and 2000s, I brought many deputations here to the late Jackie Healy-Rae, including fishermen from places in Kilmakilloge, Sneem, Blackwater and Cromane. He met Ministers who gave money for piers. We need to remember that a pier is no good if fishermen cannot fish from it because they do not have a thing called a quota. That brings us onto quotas. What did Minister do about quotas? He is funding piers and said he gave €20 million to Donegal. I refer to the €43 million of the annual quota we lost during the Brexit negotiations. What has the Minister been doing to renegotiate that? What is he doing when it comes to fighting for more for our fishermen? A pier is no good if Irish fishermen cannot fish off it.  There are beautiful piers in Donegal and the Spanish are parked there. Spanish fishermen have the quota to go in and out of there. Our own lads are idle and have no income. I ask the Minister to address that and knock out the confusion. We are bringing forward the motion today. The Minister has welcomed it. When will he welcome it by saying he agrees with it and, not only that, he will put his money where his mouth is? The Minister has said the issue is not raised enough. It is being raised today. I will tell the Minister who I am speaking on behalf of because I thank them for meeting me over the past number of weeks. I will start in the heartland of Deputy Michael Collins, Castletownbere. I thank those in Lauragh, Kilmakilloge, Tuosist, the Kenmare River, Castlecove, Caherdaniel, Blackwater, Sneem, Cahersiveen, the Ring of Kerry, Killorglin, Cromane and Dingle. All of these inshore fishermen have no money at the moment. I am standing here today on their behalf. I have met and consulted them. I spoke to them this morning and last night. They asked me to ask the Minister, in an earnest, but hard and firm way, whether he will give them the money because they need it.  They do not have any income. They cannot get any type of social welfare. They are not part of any scheme that is there for bigger fishermen. I do not begrudge the bigger fishermen anything. I cannot remember who it was, but perhaps it was a Sinn Féin Deputy who said earlier that there should be no such thing as trying to divide large and small fishermen. We are not doing that. We are standing up today specifically for small inshore fishermen who might have a part-time or full-time income from fishing. At the moment, they have no income from fishing. I ask the Minister to please address that. I am on my knees today asking him to address that. The whole thrust of this motion is that we are looking for money. When fisherpeople do not have an income, that has massive knock-on effect on local rural communities. All we want is a thing called fair play. There has been a sell-out over the years. Pair trawling in places like the Kenmare river, which others called Kenmare Bay, hoovers up everything that is there. It is morally wrong to do that and it is debarring other people from having stock to fish. I have raised this issue for many years. This practice resulted in a court case, which did not go right at the time. The issue needs to be sorted out to ensure the practice stops forever. What are Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael backbenchers going to do? Are they going to sell out the fisherpeople in the same way that they sold out the farmers? I have no pride in saying on the record of the Dáil that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have lost rural Ireland. Do not mind the Green Party because it never had it to lose it. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have lost their hold over good people. I will not criticise people in those communities who supported Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael because they were sound and good workers and people. They are gone forever from them. I do not know where they are going to go, but I know they will not stand with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael because they did not stand with them. They sold them out and let them down. We are here today scraping and begging to see whether the Minister will give them €12 million. The Minister made a great speech earlier but never said he would give them the money. It is absolutely crazy. I want a bit of clarification about Union Hall because it was stated that an application was made for a barrier. That is factually incorrect.

I promise I will stop in time. The Minister boasted about the money he gave for piers in Donegal. There have been applications from County Kerry. A very small amount of money for our piers would help our fishermen to keep going. Kerry County Council put forward excellent proposal after proposal, but we have not received funding. I ask the Minister to support them.  The main thrust of the argument today is to ask the Minister to not let us down and put us in a situation whereby we have to go back to people and tell them we brought forward the motion, did our best and were supported strongly by Sinn Féin and other Independents, for which we thank them and, despite that, the Minister's backbenchers stood up, praised him and clapped him on the back while at the same time giving us nothing. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to allow my time to be transferred to the Minister so that we can hear whether he will give us a couple of straight answers. I ask the Minister not to sit down without saying, "Yes" or "No" to giving us money for the inshore fishing sector.

I want to be very clear to Deputy Michael Collins. I was not accusing Cork County Council of being asleep at the wheel. Rather, I was accusing Deputy Collins of being asleep at the wheel because he was up here railing and ranting about an application that did not get funding, but which was not submitted. There is no proposal from Cork County Council regarding the development of Union Hall. No proposal is ready which meets the criteria in regard to a development grant for Union Hall because Cork County Council still needs to do the preparatory and scoping work, which is not covered by the Department and is not covered by the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, scheme, in order to get to that stage. The Deputy is asleep at the wheel because his brother was chairman of Cork County Council. If the two of them had been tick-tacking and more focused on doing the work rather than giving out, they might have been aware of that before the Deputy got up on the floor of the Dáil today to give out again.

The post-Christmas period is always a time of financial pressure but the soaring cost of living sees households really up against it. People are due to be hit with massive energy bills as Government supports are swallowed up. Parents are finding it difficult to put food on the table as the price of groceries has skyrocketed and households continue to cut back on the basics just to get by. The cost-of-living crisis has not gone away. For many households, in fact, the situation is getting worse. People continue to make hard decisions just to make it to the end of the week. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has said it has received the highest number of calls from families seeking help since the economic crash. The society is also providing record levels of support to students and young people. A poll conducted for Virgin TV News captures the reality of this crisis. The vast majority continue to stress about the impact of soaring costs on their lives. Many say they will not have enough to cover spending on essentials this month and more than a fifth say that their children have had to go without meals or clothing. Adding to the pressure, the ECB is set to hike interest rates for a fifth time next week. The hike will mean an immediate blow for those on tracker mortgages. The stream of hikes has left these households thousands of euro worse off. We know that those who had their mortgages sold to vulture funds are being aggressively exploited and battered by interest rate increases. Yet, even though there are more hikes to come, the Government refuses to bring forward any mortgage relief measures. People are genuinely worried about what is coming down the tracks as Government supports come to an end. When Sinn Féin public representatives are out in our communities, people constantly come to the door with their extortionate gas bills in hand and they are very worried about the next one. As things stand, at the end of February the reduced VAT rate for gas and electricity comes to an end as does the reduced rate of excise duty for petrol, diesel and home heating oil and the ban on energy disconnections. Four weeks later, the moratorium on evictions runs out. This presents the perfect storm waiting to happen for workers and families. The Government has said that it will meet in the coming weeks to discuss the future of cost-of-living supports but after two years of being hammered by soaring living costs, households need clarity and certainty about what is going to happen next. They need that clarity and certainty from the Taoiseach now. He has said there will be no cliff-edge but people need to see the plan. Tá an ghéarchéim sa chostas maireachtála ag cur daoine faoi bhrú dáiríre. Caithfidh an Rialtas a chinntiú go bhfaigheann teaghlaigh an tacaíocht a theastaíonn. Tá oibrithe agus teaghlaigh ar chiumhais na haille agus ní féidir leis sin tarlú. My questions are these. Will the Taoiseach provide struggling households today with certainty they need? Can he set out his plan? Will he commit to extending the supports and protections that are coming to an end? Will he please examine options to introduce targeted, tailored and time-bound mortgage interest relief for struggling mortgage holders?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-25 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	126	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The cost of living is a matter that concerns huge numbers of individuals, families and businesses across the country. It is very much the issue that is coming up on the doors for our public representatives as well, when we are knocking on doors and speaking to people, and not other matters. I have to say that I agree with Deputy McDonald's assessment. A lot of people, families and businesses are struggling with the cost of living. Tá go leor daoine faoi bhrú. Tá an costas maireachtála an-ard agus cabhróidh an Rialtas. Incomes are rising in Ireland but the cost of living is rising faster. What that means in real terms is that a lot of people, if not most people, are worse off this year than they were last year. We are seeing inflation slowing. Inflation is not as high as it was a few months ago but there is a big difference between inflation slowing down and prices going down. It is just that prices are going up less fast than they were earlier but that is not a good situation to be in. Prices are continuing to rise, notwithstanding the fact that inflation is not rising as fast as it was before.  As I mentioned, the Government is here to help and wants to help. We can do so because our economy is strong, because of the economic policies pursued by this Government in recent years and also because our public finances are in good order because of the good work done by the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform, and Finance, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, in particular, in recent years. What have we done in the past three weeks? We have significantly reduced the cost of childcare, by around 25%, which has helped a lot of families. We have increased the pension by €12 per week. In fact, all weekly welfare payments have been increased by €12. Approximately 70,000 elderly people now qualify for the fuel allowance who did not qualify last year. Those applications are still coming in and I encourage people to apply. Income taxes have gone down and people will see that in their pay slips this month, if they have not already. The rent tax credit is now available to hundreds of thousands of renters, at €500 per renter, per taxpayer, or €1,000 per couple. If three people are renting together, they each get the €500 credit. A lot of people have not yet applied for that and I really encourage them to do so. All of these measures are permanent and do not end at the end of February. I have just given the Deputy an example of five things that the Government has done just in the past three weeks to help people with the cost of living, which are permanent and which do not expire at the end of February.I want to make that clear. The Deputy is correct to say that at the end of February a number of measures will expire. I have said, as has the Tánaiste, that there will not be a cliff edge in that regard. We will not be able to continue everything as we just do not have the resources to do so, but there will not be a cliff edge. What will happen in the coming weeks is the relevant Ministers will sit down with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance and we will work out which measures we can continue and which ones we cannot. We will try to do that as quickly as possible, in the next couple of weeks, so that people have certainty long before the end of February. That is the work we are doing at the moment.

Notwithstanding the measures the Government has taken, people are still struggling, as I have described. The Taoiseach has confirmed that he also recognises that. All along, we have said to the Taoiseach and his Government that the one-off measures that were introduced to assist people were, of course, welcomed by people. All help is good help when you are under pressure. What people really have needed and still need, however, is a sense of certainty and an ability to plan. They need to know where their household will be and how they will provide for themselves and their children at the end of next month and the month after that. While the Taoiseach's acknowledgement of the potential cliff edge is welcome, as is his assertion that there will be no cliff edge, we need more than that now. People need to see the colour of his money. They have to see the shape of the plan. I again ask whether the reduced VAT rate for gas and electricity will come to an end or whether the Government will continue it. Likewise, will the reduction in excise duty on petrol, diesel and home heating oil be continued? What about the moratorium on energy disconnections and the moratorium on evictions? People need that sense of a plan and certainty now.

Those are very fair and legitimate questions to ask but I cannot answer them today because the Government has not made decisions in respect of the measures that expire at the end of February. We will do so, however, and we will make sure that people have certainty long before the end of February comes. What we have done to help people with the cost of living is a combination of one-off and temporary measures and also permanent measures. That should be acknowledged. The reduction in the cost of childcare is permanent and I would like to go further again in the budget later this year. The increase in pensions and weekly welfare payments of an extra €12 a week is also permanent, as are the extension of the fuel allowance, the reduction in income taxes and the rent tax credit. The increase in the national minimum wage, above the rate of inflation last year, will be built on next year. In addition, there are increases in public sector pay and in some of the parts of the private sector that are governed by employment regulation orders. So long as this Government is in office and we pursue the economic policies that we have been pursuing, keep the public finances in order and there is no change of Government, people can be confident that those measures will be permanent.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-25 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	130	The Taoiseach and his predecessor, Deputy Micheál Martin, repeatedly told this House that housing was the biggest single social issue facing the Government. In his first interview after he assumed the office of Taoiseach, he said we needed to turn the corner on housing with a Covid-style response. He then clarified that what he meant by that was to adopt a can-do attitude. His can-do attitude appeared to evaporate in the Dáil yesterday when he flippantly dismissed concerns in respect of the significant under-delivery of social homes last year. The target for the delivery of new-build social homes last year was 9,000. That was reduced quietly in November to 8,000, and in December the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform warned that just 6,500 were likely to be delivered, nearly 30% below the original target. Even then, the majority of them were purchased from the private sector. When this was raised with the Taoiseach yesterday, he offered no explanation or apology for this gross failure by the Government to deliver on its own targets. He said, "we have not built perhaps as many as we would have liked or as many as we had intended". What is the point in the Government's housing targets? Can the Taoiseach explain that to me? Judging by his comment yesterday, he does not seem to care that the targets for social homes have been missed for three years in a row. The figures are even worse when it comes to affordable homes. Having delivered zero affordable homes in its first two years, the Government is set to miss last year's target by a whopping 80%. Fewer than 1,000 affordable homes will be delivered out of a modest target of 4,100. Perhaps this should not come as a surprise, given that the Department failed to spend a staggering €1 billion of its capital budget during the biggest housing crisis in the history of the State. The Taoiseach and his predecessor continually claim they are prioritising housing but where is the evidence for that? It cannot be found in the Government repeatedly missing its own targets, the record number of people in homelessness, record rents, record house prices or the record number of adults in their 20s or 30s or even older who are living in childhood bedrooms and cannot afford to move out. People desperately need hope that the housing disaster can be addressed. The Taoiseach claims it will be addressed using some vague can-do attitude that has apparently been absent from this Government so far, but his record is one of broken promises. Is it any wonder that a new poll carried out by Virgin Media News found that a staggering 92% of young people are worried they will never be able to afford a home? My questions are simple. What is the point in the Government's modest housing targets when it keeps missing them? Why should anyone believe any of the Government's commitments on housing? Does the Taoiseach really understand the magnitude of this problem?

I do not think anybody living in this country - certainly nobody who runs for election or gets elected - could not understand the magnitude of the housing crisis we are facing. It is the biggest social issue with which the Government and the country is currently grappling. It affects people in all sorts of different ways, whether it is people who cannot afford to buy their first home, people who are paying massive rents or people in their late 20s or late 30s still living in their childhood bedroom. It affects people in so many different ways and it is holding us back as a country, an economy and a society. That is why we are determined, as a Government, to turn the corner on the housing crisis as soon as we can. Housing for All is our plan to do that and it is showing results. Our main housing target last year will not just be met; it will be exceeded. We targeted the construction of 25,000 new homes last year. We do not have the numbers in yet but it looks like it will be closer to 28,000, so that main housing target was not only met, it was exceeded last year. Of course, our target for this year is to build approximately 29,000 new homes. I want that to be exceeded this year as well, by the way. We are working really hard to make sure the slowdown in commencements does not result in a slowdown in completions. The Deputy might not know this but 16,000 people, couples and families bought their first home last year. That was the highest in 16 years. I know it is cold comfort to people who cannot buy a home yet, but the highest number in 15 or 16 years - 16,00 people - is not a small thing to have achieved.

Of course, we have new forms of public housing that are now becoming a reality, such as cost rental, for example. As regards the social housing target, the Deputy is correct that we missed it last year. Some 6,500 new social homes were provided. What the Deputy did not acknowledge - she should have done so, frankly, to be fair - in her question is that was still the highest number of new social homes provided in Ireland for a very long time. We do not know how long. It might have been the highest since the foundation of the State. I know people talk nostalgically about the 1920s when the Free State built a lot of social housing, or about the 1940s, the 1950s, the 1970s and the 1980s. We cannot find on record a year in which more new social housing was provided by the Government in its many forms than last year. We are not happy with it either. We want it to be much higher this year - closer to 9,000 or 10,000. That is our objective.

A briefing note prepared for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in December stated that the reliance on the private sector delivery is a vulnerability for 2023. When it comes to social homes, 2,706 new-build social homes were delivered at the end of September.More than 70% had been acquired by the private sector. I repeatedly see in my area that when a housing estate is built, the council buys a number of the houses or, worse, takes a long lease, which is very poor value for money. We had capital underspend of €1 billion last year. We are certainly not seeing the scaling up of direct building by the State, which has been talked about. Some of the comments made about the State's response have been fact-checked by The Journal in an article published a couple of months. This challenges much of what is being said about the numbers delivered.

I have a different view: we need more public housing and more private housing. We need more private housing for people who want to buy and own their first home, which is a social objective we should all get behind. Also, we need more public housing for people who cannot afford to buy their own home. It is not a case of having more or less of either; we need more of both. That is the view of the Government. I do not accept the argument that we are not scaling up the delivery of public housing by the State. When people study this, they need to acknowledge there is more to the State than local authorities, or councils. For example, the Land Development Agency, LDA, which has about 4,000 homes either under construction or in planning, is a State body. The State funds approved housing bodies, such as the Iveagh Trust, the Peter McVerry Trust, Clúid Housing and other such bodies that we admire, to provide social housing. Anyone talking about public housing in the State who looks only to local authorities is either not fully knowledgeable or disingenuous, because there is more to the State and local authorities.

Cá bhfuil an tuarascáil atá geallta? Laistigh de na téarmaí tagartha, dúradh linn go mbeadh an tuarascáil críochnaithe roimh dheireadh na bliana. Tá deireadh na bliana imithe agus tá bliain nua ann. Cá bhfuil an tuarascáil? An bhfuil sí ag an Taoiseach? An bhfuil dréacht-tuarascáil léite aige? Muna bhfuil, cá bhfuil sí? Cén fáth go bhfuil deifir ann maidir leis an tuarascáil in ainneoin chomh tromchúiseach is atá na líomhaintí agus na hábhair a nocht na mná cróga ó na fórsaí cosanta? A year ago, exactly on this date, the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, announced an independent investigation into the allegations of Women of Honour and the women's experience in our armed forces. The aim was to establish a judge-led independent review to examine issues relating to sexual misconduct, including rape, bullying, harassment and discrimination in the forces. The announcement followed on from the documentary on RTÉ Radio 1 by Katie Hannon on 11 September. We were all silenced when we heard that show. I know exactly where I was; I was on my way back from Achill. The four of us in the car were totally silent as we listened to the programme. From 11 September until this date a year ago, there was engagement with Women of Honour. The women engaged with hope and full commitment for a while; however, they were not happy. The Government decided to go ahead with the review. Trust was broken at that point because what the women wanted in respect of what they had exposed was not what the got. They came forward trusting that the Government finally wanted to do something about the culture that appears to be endemic in the armed forces among both men and women. With this in mind, the Government set up a review body with three people, with Ms Justice Bronagh O'Hanlon in charge. The Taoiseach might clarify why the terms of reference have been breached. Where is the final report that was promised within a year? My colleagues and I have repeatedly asked Dáil questions on this. We were told the Government was perfectly on target to get the report before the end of November. Where is it? The Taoiseach might clarify another matter. In one of the answers we received, there was a reference to a discrete issue regarding another report, from a senior counsel. Has that been received and fed to the tribunal?

I understand the report is either complete or nearing completion and that if it is not already with the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, it is certainly due in the very near future. When he receives it, he will consider it. He will probably want to speak to the Attorney General about it as well, and then he will bring a recommendation to the Government as to how we take it forward. It is important to state the judge-led review was always a first step towards further action. This is a matter that the Government is very concerned about. The Tánaiste is deeply concerned about it. Indeed, he met representatives of Women of Honour personally roughly a year ago. I know he wants to take the matter forward, but I do not want to say any more than that for fear of giving the Deputy inaccurate information. That is my understanding of the situation as of today.

The terms of reference stated a report should be completed within a year. The Minister, at various stages, told us we were on target in that regard. Has a report been completed? Has a report been handed over to the Minister? The answer to each of these questions is "Yes" or "No". When the announcement was made, there was a related matter in that the Minister had received the nomination of a Ms Ruth Fitzgerald, SC, with a view to having her conduct an independent assessment of the specific actions taken. It is set out here. I have a question in this regard. We were told by the Government that it was to be a discrete assessment and that the outcome would be made available to the independent review group once completed. Was that report completed? I would like to take extra time. However, to be fair, I do not know where I am with the time because we have got extra time. Where am I now with it?

It has been acknowledged repeatedly by the Minister and other members of the Government that the culture in question is not of the past; it is the pervading culture still. At the weekend, we saw in the newspapers that women and men are afraid. I am out of time and will not take up any more time. I would really like a specific answer.

West Cork has four ambulances: one based in Clonakilty; one based in Castletownbere, one based in Bantry General Hospital; and one based in Skibbereen. I am reliably informed that, on most days and from early morning to late at night, the Clonakilty ambulance is in Cork city and county, not in west Cork, where it is supposed to be. The Castletownbere ambulance is in Kerry, tied up all day and night, leaving just two ambulances to cover the whole of west Cork. Cork, being 132 km long, is the longest county in the country. When the Skibbereen and Bantry ambulances get a call from anywhere in west Cork, they are instructed, no matter how big or small the medical issue is, to take the patient to Cork University Hospital, in many cases bypassing Bantry General Hospital, which could easily sort the problems. This is an issue for another day. When the two ambulances arrive at Cork University Hospital, their patients most likely cannot be taken into the hospital due to overcrowding, meaning the ambulances are tied up outside the door for hours, thus leaving the whole of west Cork without any ambulance cover. To compound the problem further, some of the west Cork ambulances are sent to Waterford, Tipperary or Listowel, leaving west Cork with no ambulance service cover on many nights. How many people have to die before the Government sits up and takes notice that this system is not working? The HSE and the ambulance service cannot hide behind the dark of night and hope no-one will know they have no cover in west Cork for the people from the Beara Peninsula, Bantry, the Mizen, Sheep's Head, Skibbereen and Dunmanway, as well as Clonakilty, Bandon and Kinsale. It is a massive geographical spread with no cover and this is on the Taoiseach's watch. The facts speak for themselves: people lying on the roadside for hours after a car crash; elderly people lying for almost a day after a fall, one of whom was left for 16 or 17 hours and a case that turned out to be a serious broken bone; or in some recent cases parents driving a seriously ill family member to the hospital as no ambulance could be found. I have spoken of this to the former Taoiseach but not a thing has changed. Now I ask the Taoiseach to make changes to save the lives of the people of west Cork who require a simple ambulance service that cannot be found. I ask the Taoiseach to look at the imminent collapse of the ambulance services in west Cork. The ambulance service is losing the best staff anyone could ask for due to stress issues around delivering hours and hours hundreds of kilometres away from their base. West Cork cannot be allowed to remain wide open for so many nights without cover, with this Government standing idly by and covered by the dark of night. It cannot continue. What does the Taoiseach plan to overhaul this mess, which is having serious consequences for the people from Innishannon to the Mizen Peninsula?

The Minister for Health is beside me here in the Chamber and he will be happy to engage directly with the Deputy on this and to provide more information and answer the Deputy's questions as best we can. On the wider issue, we are implementing a programme of constant improvement of our national ambulance service at the moment. We acknowledge that response times are not as good as they should be and ought to be. We are increasing the number of ambulances and increasing the number of staff who work in the national ambulance service and also improving and upgrading ambulance bases. Increasingly, it is a service that is provided by paramedics and advanced paramedics. These are people who can treat patients on the scene and are able to decide which is the most appropriate hospital to take the patient to. This is a really important improvement and a very important change from our ambulance service of the past. We also have an air ambulance service. The Deputy will be aware that ten years ago there was no helicopter ambulance service in Ireland. We now have two helicopters operating. This is a big improvement especially when it comes to major trauma. It is a significant improvement. This is all happening at a time when our population is rising and is ageing and the demands for health care are increasing. As a result of that, we are developing a new national ambulance strategy and the funding is there to back it up so we can improve our ambulance service, get people treated on the scene by paramedics and make sure they are taken to the right hospital where the most appropriate level of care can be provided.

I appreciate the Taoiseach's offer that the Minister will engage on this matter. Staffing is an issue. The staff the ambulance service has at the moment are exhausted. Some are walking away. I have spoken to them personally. There were great ambulance staff who just could not cope anymore and just walked away from the whole crisis they see there. There are solutions out there if worked on. I will put some of these solutions to the Taoiseach. In 2013 the west Cork people and ambulance staff were sold a fib that there would be a 24-7 rapid response vehicle in west Cork at all times. It would be a truly great service, if delivered. Fast forward ten years and what the people of west Cork have is a daytime rapid response vehicle, which I was told was out for 94 days last year. This broken promise of a 24-hour service has cost numerous lives in west Cork. If we are to put our ambulance service right we need an intermediate care vehicle to transport people from hospital to nursing homes or to community hospitals and back. This needs to be put in place immediately. These solutions will not resolve this huge ambulance crisis in west Cork but if worked on it will make a very positive difference. I urge the Taoiseach to work with all involved to introduce these solutions. If not, the consequences will be fatal for the people of west Cork who require an ambulance service.

Ambulance staff are among those. It has been a relentless three years for people who work in our health service. Many of us went from lock down to unlock, and perhaps got to spend time at home or work from home, whereas our health services have been really stretched. It has been an extraordinary three years with a pandemic. Now that the pandemic has entered a different phase, all of the unmet healthcare needs that we could not deal with during the pandemic have boomeranged and there is a huge snapback in demand for healthcare. This has made it extremely difficult for healthcare staff. That is not unique to Ireland. As the Deputy will be aware, it is also the case in the North, in Britain and all around the world. On the rapid response vehicle, as I have said, I do not have a reply on that today for the Deputy. The Minister will come back to the Deputy on that and we will see what we can do.

The Taoiseach has stated that the Coillte deal was not the Government's preferred model. Of course, the Taoiseach has been aware since 2021 that Coillte was exploring such a joint venture. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, confirmed that on 2 June 2022 a shareholder letter of expectation was issued to Coillte, directing it to develop initiatives precisely such as this joint venture. As the Taoiseach gave the green light for this approach I ask the Taoiseach now to put a stop to this outrageous proposal.

It cannot work both ways. State-owned enterprises are autonomous, have their own boards and make their own commercial decisions, subject to statute.

They are signed for the first five years. I have said, the Tánaiste has said, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has said, this is not our preferred model going forward. Our preferred model is Coillte planting trees on State land and especially farmers. I was at the Irish Farmers' Association AGM dinner last night and had the chance to discuss this with them, and particularly around encouraging farmers to plant all or some of their own land. That is why the new forestry programme is so pro-farmer and is much more attractive than what was there in the past.

In that context, last week I raised with the Taoiseach the issue pertaining to Deputy Damien English, the Taoiseach's party colleague, who resigned from his ministerial post due to the revelations that he had submitted incorrect information on a planning application to Meath County Council in 2008. During Leaders' Questions last week I asked the Taoiseach if the Government and his party tolerated behaviour, because we know that false information resulted in him being granted planning permission for a once-off dwelling, to which he was not entitled. I want to follow up with the Taoiseach. What further action does the Taoiseach propose to take, and particularly at a time when thousands of couples and families have been refused planning permission to build homes across rural Ireland and at a time when 40% of people under the age of 35 continue to live with their parents because they cannot find homes due to the housing crisis? What further action does the Taoiseach propose to take-----

At present we are embarking on a multi-billion euro strategy to delivery offshore wind energy and again we will have to utilise foreign investment houses. The Taoiseach may not be able to answer my questions now but he might come back to me in writing. I have a couple of questions about State protections. Have we protected ourselves in terms of the future spot rate of electricity to the Irish consumer versus what will be exported from the Irish wind energy grid? Have we proposed any options within the contracts that would allow the Irish State to buy out those contracts at any time during the 25-year licensing period. Has Government looked at any real options to provide community participation? In Scotland, wind farms can attract up to 50% community involvement.

The Minister has said to me she has no records and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has them. The NCSE says it is up to the boards of management to have the figures. If the NCSE and the Department do not know how many children are waiting for these special needs places, how are we going to plan for the future as to how many units we need? There are massive anomalies in the system. We need to know how many children, unfortunately, need these special places. We need to know for the projected building programme for new units where we have boards of management and school communities that are willing to have the units and provide extra supports for children with special needs. There is a whole passing of the parcel here. Boards of management cannot be expected to know anything outside their own area and the NCSE should know. The Department will have to get records as to how many people are waiting. We need to have a train of thought here that we know how many people we need to service.

He was turned down and appealed this in September. He is still waiting for that appeal. On investigation, it appears all the board members resigned from the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal last year. In a reply to a parliamentary question last June, the Minister for Finance advised at that stage that there were 382 appeals outstanding from 2021 and 175 appeals to date from 2022. I have been advised that figure is now up to 700. The Minister advised that an expression of interest seeking suitable candidates for the board closed on 21 April last year and a panel had been convened. This board is still not set up as far as I am aware. I am seeking an update on the situation. I am sure the Taoiseach would agree that it is not satisfactory or acceptable that 700 disabled people have been left in limbo waiting for their appeal to be heard. What can they do about?

There are a lot of smart people in this House but I think the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister, Deputy McGrath are two of the smartest. Their combined efforts in the financial ministries have us in a strong position as a country. My question is about vehicle registration tax, VRT, for people with disabilities. Before conversion of vans, VRT averages around €22,000 to €40,000. On top of that, it typically costs €22,000 plus VAT to kit out the van afterwards. This is a cost many people simply cannot bear. I am aware some submissions have come in to the Minister's Department. Essentially we are looking to have adapted vans reclassified so that the cost is not as high and some of the VRT benefits pass on, whereby they would be treated equally to commercial vans and drivers would not pay on the double for this. I urge the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to keep up the good work and I hope he can give us some positive news on this front.

Budget 2023 provided funding from the climate action fund in respect of the provision of solar panels for schools up to 6 kW output. The provision of solar panels for schools will be fully funded. The national development plan provides for capital funding of more than €4.4 billion for investment in school infrastructure during the period through to 2025. Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department's technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 building energy ratings since 2009, with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the current building regulations. In addition to this, 10% of primary school energy is provided via solar panels. There is infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging. I am not sure this fully answers the Deputy's question. In short, perhaps this is something we want to get done. We will fully pay the cost of the panels.

He made the application last January and it was approved by the council in July, but it was appealed by a third party to An Bord Pleanála. The board was due to make a decision on Monday, 12 December, but the man was told that day that the decision would be delayed by three months. I have been told by a planner in Cavan County Council that some decisions take up to a year because of a lack of staff. If the Government is serious about providing additional housing, why has An Bord Pleanála not been resourced properly to deal with appeals so that they are not delayed any longer than they should be? This man's financing will run out within that three months, so he may not be in a position to proceed with the development. We need a properly resourced An Bord Pleanála and designated timeframes for decisions, similar to local authorities, within which decisions must be made.

The medium-term plan is to replace An Bord Pleanála with a new coimisiún pleanála and also to introduce a new planning and development Bill, which I think has been published, that puts in place statutory timelines for decisions, like the Deputy suggested. In the meantime, we are backfilling An Bord Pleanála with additional staff. An interim chairperson has been appointed. The idea is to try to get through those decisions as quickly as possible because, as the Deputy rightly says, it is holding up housing developments and the development of schools, businesses and things that we really need.

I will not say he has fully recovered - he will never fully recover - but, gladly, he is back home with his parents in Enniscorthy. Quite a number of constituents have raised this issue with me and reckon that the Government is not moving quickly enough on dangerous dogs. A dog warden stated on national radio this morning that, once upon a time, dog wardens only dealt with vicious dogs, but now they are also dealing with vicious owners. Aggression towards dog wardens has increased dramatically over the years, so them having body cams should be considered. Having dangerous dogs is now being used for social status, one directed towards aggression and intimidation. Swift action is needed. That action should be led by politicians and the Department should be directed and told what to do on the issue.

Indeed, we are all aware of the tragic case of a young baby killed by a dog, a matter that was recently before the Coroner's Court. Quite a number of farmers have been devastated by the destruction produced by marauding dogs. A working group on dog control has been established. It involves the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and also the Department of Rural and Community Development. The terms of reference are being finalised. The group will meet on Thursday, 26 January. It will look at issues relating to dog control and make recommendations quickly. We can then act on them.

Her daughter has a beautiful five-year-old autistic son who attends a unit in Kilsaran school. After begging schools, it was the only one his mother could get a place in even though they live in Dundalk. Thankfully, the unit is brilliant. Mason is over the average height for his age and strong. In addition, he is a flight risk and constantly trying to run away. He is volatile and, in a temper, will hurt his mother and brother on occasion. She is not looking for respite, but she struggles with caring for him and does her best as a single mother. She is now a prisoner in her own home, as is her other son, a ten-year-old. She lives in a two-bedroom terraced house with a small garden. It is heartbreaking. As a grandmother, Claire can only do a certain amount. She is not able to bring him out or, even if she is with her daughter, Mason will still run away. He has no sense of danger. The child psychologist recommended that he attend occupational therapy service, but there is a two-year waiting list in Louth. Even private services have been closed to waiting lists due to demand.

It needs more special needs assistant, SNA, hours as well as building work to deliver extra space as quickly as possible. It also needs an additional teacher. There are 37 students in a classroom of 60 sq. m, which is not acceptable. There is a general acceptance by the Department of Education that extra resources are required for the school, but I wish to discuss the length of time it is taking the school's applications for the building works and additional teacher to be processed. We would like to see the process streamlined and decisions reached much more quickly than is the case currently.

Almost 560 people have lost their lives since the outbreak of the most recent protests last September and over 20,000 people have been arrested. Four or five Iranians have been executed for having the temerity to protest against their government. The previous Minister for Foreign Affairs was adamant that the reopening should go ahead. I fully accept the bona fides of the Irish Government and others as regards the importance of having diplomatic relations with all regimes, but how can we justify what is effectively tacit support for what has been happening in Iran for the past five or six months by continuing with the plan to reopen the embassy in 2023?

On behalf of the Government, I want to reiterate our unreserved condemnation of what is happening in Iran, particularly the execution of people who are protesting against the regime there. We stand with the people of Iran in their demands for women's equality, for LGBT rights, for democracy and also for religious freedom. It is the view of the Government that diplomatic channels should remain open in order to relay these concerns and deal with other important regional issues. In 2021, the Government decided to re-establish a diplomatic presence in Iran. This is now in the form of a chargé d'affaires, who is present in Tehran. For now anyway, the Irish Embassy in Ankara remains accredited to Iran. We have no date at the moment for the establishment of a permanent embassy.

It seems to be an issue of resources. Could that be looked at specifically for those councils where the process is taking a longer time? These days, unfortunately, when people are applying for housing supports, it is often because they are in a crisis.

This morning in the audiovisual room, I hosted Maria Delaney, the journalist who undertook that investigation, along with Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and the International Transport Workers’ Federation to provide a wider context of the exploitation of migrant fishers. There are very clear and quick reforms we can do to try to improve the situation and address the exploitation. While we may be addressing the national referral mechanism for victims of human trafficking, it is important we amend the Workplace Relations Act to improve the jurisdiction of the Workplace Relations Commission to look at the issue of improved enforcement around automatic identification systems and, ultimately, to ratify the Work in Fishing Convention of the International Labour Organization, ILO.

How can the Government justify such discrimination? Is it because the Ukrainians are European? Is it because they are white? Why is it okay for anybody to have to sleep on the street? Does the Taoiseach not accept that is not necessary for anybody - Irish, Syrian, Ukrainian - to be on the street in a situation where we have 50,000 homes that have been vacant for six years or more.

We are facing an unprecedented situation, a refugee crisis the likes of which Europe has not seen since the Second World War and the likes of which we have never seen in Ireland. In the past year we have taken in about 100,000 people, mostly from Ukraine but also from other parts of the world. We have provided them with shelter, heat, light, education, healthcare and, in many cases, employment. There is no shortage of care or compassion when it comes to this Government and this country, but there is a shortage of capacity. We are running out of accommodation for people who come to Ireland. People who come to Ireland from Ukraine have a different legal status. They are beneficiaries of temporary protection and are legally entitled to be here. When it comes to people who come here seeking international protection, it is less clear. They may or may not be genuine refugees. It does put them in a different category than those coming from Ukraine.

We have all read and heard the horror stories. Unfortunately, a lot of them are true. I am sure the Taoiseach saw the thousands of angry people who took to the streets of Limerick on Saturday. We know the hospital is stretched far beyond capacity and the staff are stretched beyond breaking point. It is the only emergency department that serves more than 470,000 people. The mid-west has a disproportionately ageing and disadvantaged population in comparison with the rest of the Republic. It is the only region where there is one stand-alone model 4 hospital with no model 3 facility to support it. Under the Taoiseach's previous two Governments, people have died on the road in Loop Head and Liscannor waiting for an ambulance to reach them in time. Is this our rural future? The Taoiseach is a trained doctor. He cannot seriously look me in the eye and say this is acceptable. The case has never been stronger to reinstate emergency department services at Ennis. The people of the mid-west, particularly in Clare, want the Government to see sense on this issue and to put a task force in place to start the process.

However, in my view the reconfiguration that happened some time ago was not done in the right way. There is a very strong clinical view for the consolidation of emergency departments. However, the resources needed to be put in place before such a reconfiguration. That is why I intervened, for example, in the reconfiguration in Navan. UHL is under significant pressure. I turned the sod recently on an additional 96 beds. There are two more plans that will provide a further 200 beds. We are also putting in a surgical hub. There is an awful lot of investment going in. We will be investing in Nenagh, Ennis and further in St. John's Hospital and other hospitals. This is the way to do it. I would also say, however, that there have to be changes to working practices and the effectiveness of patient flow through those hospitals. We saw recently that when weekend discharge and late evening discharge were put in place and the community sector and the hospital teams worked together, there was an immediate and important reduction in the number of patients on trolleys. The Government will continue to invest. We will prioritise those projects, but that must be met with changes to working practices, how patients are seen, when they are seen and when they are discharged both in the acute sector and in the community sector.

The family has a medical card but because the prescribed medicine was out of stock, she was charged €17. This was for the very same medicine, amoxicillin. To add insult to injury, the medicine she received was made by an Irish company, Athlone Laboratories, in Roscommon. If that was not bad enough, the lady in front of her was also charged for her prescription. She was charged €54 with a medical card. People with medical cards can barely afford the reduced prescription charges let alone the actual cost. When will the Government act and ensure medicine shortages are addressed and the generic substitutes are covered under the General Medical Services, GMS? People are going without medication.

I will talk specifically about north County Louth. I have received correspondence from the relevant special educational needs organiser, SENO. I will not name every school in north County Louth but I will name a couple of them. Coláiste Chú Chulainn has two ASD classes. St. Vincent's Secondary School has one ASD class. Sanction has been granted to that school for an additional three classes and that expansion is due to happen before September 2024. An extension to Bush Post Primary School is under construction and will house an ASD classroom. The projected completion date for that project is September 2024. I could also talk about De La Salle College, St. Louis Secondary School, Coláiste Rís, the Marist school and Ó Fiaich Institute of Further Education. There have obviously been conversations involving the SENO and the Department about delivery. There are many projections for 2024. A significant amount of work must be done in respect of planning. There will even be difficulties in respect of the Marist school because it is a public private partnership build. We must ensure there is a full Government response to allow for delivery. There are issues in respect of ASD services within the HSE and the education sector. We must ensure we can deliver for those parents in Dundalk and throughout County Louth who are pulling their hair out because they are not sure where their kids are going to be able to go to school.

Last month, two dozen teachers raised concerns about a non-inclusive culture regarding LGBT+ issues and the taking down of a Pride flag in the student canteen. Clearly, we need to ensure staff and students from the LGBT community and minority backgrounds are protected in all schools and that employees are guaranteed equality in their workplaces. The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, has estimated that thousands of its members are still forced to hide their sexuality due to fears of discrimination and that is despite the amendment to the Equality Act introduced on foot of Labour Party initiatives in 2015 which addressed some of the discrimination then possible in faith-based schools. Despite that important amendment, there still remain concerns about treatment of staff, discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and there are, in particular, ongoing issues in Templeogue College. What plans does the Government have to address incidents such as these that have occurred in particular schools? What plans does the Government have to ensure that LGBT+ staff in the education sector can be protected and no longer have to hide their sexuality and who they are? It is a concern to see reports that this behaviour is still going on years after the passage of legalisation in respect of marriage equality and other legislative reform in this area.

I wonder has he considered two things in respect of our National Educational Psychological Service. The child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, suggests a damning situation in respect of the treatment of young people with mental health issues and so on. There is a big overlap between that issue and the need for proper psychological services in schools. Such services are already considerably under-resourced and understaffed. There is a particular lack of psychologists. Children who are fleeing war and the children of refugees are often already traumatised and are then moved around from school to school and area to area when they need stability. We need psychological services and supports for those children. At every level, we need to up our game considerably in respect of the availability of psychological services. We would ideally have psychologists in every school. We make it incredibly difficult for people to qualify as educational psychologists because of extortionate fees.

My question to the Taoiseach is, what will the Department do in circumstances where that is not the case and where there is, in the words of the staff of the Spiritan-run Templeogue College, a toxic culture and atmosphere? I will quote from a collective grievance submitted by a majority of staff members of that institution. Writing to the principal, they stated that regrettably, matters came to a head recently when the principal unilaterally decided to remove a rainbow Pride flag from the school canteen area, which became a rather emotional issue for many of the students and staff in the school. They went on to say that the removal of the Pride flag from the school canteen was not an isolated incident. Following the incident, the principal reportedly cited the Spiritan ethos as justification for the action. The staff expressed that they were upset and disturbed by the principal's statement. They went on to state that this episode merely represented one instance of a contribution to a non-inclusive culture and environment regarding LGBTQ+ issues, led by the principal in her capacity as head teacher. The staff also expressed their deep unease about the principal's belief that any LGBTQI+ individual is living a lifestyle, as she described in meetings on 21 and 22 November 2022. They went on to state that the facilitation process says that for many, the style of management, especially from the principal, feels oppressive, unsafe and fear-inducing in many aspects.

Deputy Ó Murchú mentioned the issue of ASD classes in County Louth. I agree we have a need for more investment across the country to allow space for more ASD classes come September, when they are particularly going to be needed. They are needed now but they will be needed even more come September. That will require additional capital investment. The Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, are engaging with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on precisely that issue at the moment. In fairness to the Department of Education, once it gets capital funding, it tends to be able to spend it. That is not always the case with every Department for various reasons. The Department is engaging on that issue as we speak. I am not inclined to answer questions about a specific school because I do not necessarily know if what I read in media reports is accurate or reflects the full story. However, I can say that there should be no place for discrimination against LGBT students and staff in any school, full stop, regardless of patronage or whether the school in question charges fees. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Foley, to respond to any questions about a specific school. I agree with the view that there should be a psychologist in every school, certainly any school of scale. A service should be available to smaller schools. Achieving that, of course, is a different matter. There are skills shortages across the board in Ireland and, indeed, there are similar shortages across the rest of the world. There are only so many psychologists to go around. We must consider-----

The issue of the CAMHS report was raised. The findings of the independent review are concerning and raise significant risks and deficits. Similar to the Mental Health Commission, I thank the young people and their families who spoke to those conducting the independent review and shared their experiences. That was not easy. It is incumbent on all of us to listen and ensure that action is taken. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has been clear on this point. I will meet her and the HSE on the issue of the CAMHS report tomorrow. It should be said that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, asked the Mental Health Commission to expand the remit of its report following on from the Maskey report. I am advised there has been ongoing and extensive engagement between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Mental Health Commission concerning the findings. Following receipt of the draft of the interim report in late 2022, the HSE acted in relation to individual service users. It is essential that a full review of open cases by the HSE takes place to ensure that all children and young people are receiving the appropriate care they need. I am told this is now under way. The HSE will arrange further clinical follow-up for any child where it is required and will make direct contact with parents and guardians as necessary. We are encouraging any people with particular concerns about their children to contact their key workers.

I spoke with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, by telephone on 11 January 2023. This was my first opportunity to speak with the President since my reappointment as Taoiseach. She offered me her congratulations and we said we looked forward to operating closely on the important agenda of work ahead at European level, not least our collective response to the war in Ukraine and the current economic situation. We took the opportunity for an exchange on current negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. I briefed the President on efforts under way to restore the Assembly and Executive in Northern Ireland, as well as the North-South bodies, which are not functioning. We welcomed the improved atmosphere and engagement in the negotiations on the protocol and expressed a shared desire for joint solutions to issues that have arisen for people and businesses in Northern Ireland in its implementation. I thanked the President, Vice-President Šefčovič and their teams for their work and wished them every success in the period ahead. We said we looked forward to meeting in person at the special European Council meeting, which will take place in Brussels on 9 and 10 February. I met the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. She looked forward to visiting Dublin and made clear the Parliament’s continuing interest in a positive outcome to the negotiations with the United Kingdom. I spoke with Prime Minister Sunak by phone on 23 January. We discussed a range of issues, including restoring the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland and the North-South institutions, the ongoing EU negotiations on the protocol and our shared wish to strengthen British-Irish relations more broadly.

I think everybody was pleased to hear of his remarks on the improved atmosphere in Northern Ireland. The restoration of power-sharing is of paramount importance but the remaining issues and sticking points on the protocol must be progressed promptly or there undoubtedly will be repercussions. In his meetings with political parties in Northern Ireland and that with the British Prime Minister, which I believe was subsequent to his meeting with President von der Leyen, were there further reasons to be optimistic about an agreement on the protocol? Was there any discussion with President von der Leyen on the REPowerEU plan? Will he report to the House on that matter?

In June last year representatives of the city met those of several Irish universities and of Enterprise Ireland to this end. The meeting came just three months after the Saudi state executed 81 prisoners, mainly by beheading, in one day. Many were political prisoners and many had been imprisoned for the crime of being a member of a religious minority. According to the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, there are currently 61 Saudi prisoners on death row, eight of whom were arrested when they were minors. Human rights campaigners fear another mass execution in the weeks ahead. That is why they are organising protests in 60 countries on 10 and 11 February. Will the Taoiseach join me in saying that no Irish university should establish a campus in Saudi Arabia or be part of a PR exercise for this brutally repressive regime? Will he urge Ursula von der Leyen to say the same thing for Europe as a whole?

The time involved in the discussion on the Northern Ireland protocol is important. It cannot remain static, immovable or unmoved for a considerable period, considering the extent to which the European Union supported the calls to prevent land borders in this country, the need to address the pressing issues from the point of view of the European Union and the United States and the need to work at the issues involved with a view to resolving them at the earliest possible date.

The mood music seems to be better when dealing with the British Government. The Taoiseach has said the Irish protocol is working, particularly in relation to business. We are hopeful there will be a deal between the European Commission and the British Government. That needs to happen as soon as possible. We also want to see the Executive up and running. We do not accept there is a legitimate reason for it not to be up and running but the DUP has set itself up in what I would term a political cul-de-sac. That is for its members but we need to ensure all stakeholders know there can be no return to anything that even smells like a hard border. The protocol being streamlined is to be welcomed by everybody. I acknowledge the Taoiseach cannot look into a crystal ball but does he believe there will be a deal relatively soon? Is he hopeful of having the Executive running? Anything the Government can do should be done.

When the President was here in December, she spoke of Ireland’s great reception for those who came seeking sanctuary. In the last couple of days, it has once again been announced that accommodation will not be provided to people who come here seeking international protection. People have a right to pursue asylum. It is not fair for the State to say it will not be in a position to accommodate those people. That will mean refugees will be placed on the streets at a time of incredible tension and, I would say, unprecedented aggression. The State needs to do better. We understand Putin is using refugees as a tool in his war. I do not discount that but the State cannot neglect its responsibilities. We cannot say to communities already under massive strain and pressure that they can deal with it themselves. The State has a role. It cannot be in three or four weeks’ time; it has to be now. The Ministers responsible need to up their game. I do not doubt the pressure they are under but they must do better.

Why is a person from Ukraine more entitled to be accommodated than a person from Yemen or Syria, when both are fleeing similar conditions? The Taoiseach earlier said it was because they have a different status but it is a political decision of the Government to give them such a status so it does not answer the question. Why treat them differently? Is it because one is European? Is it because one is white? This policy against certain refugees is scapegoating the most vulnerable in our society in an attempt to cover up the fact that the Government’s housing policy is a complete failure. This policy will see hundreds of additional men and women rough sleeping in the coming weeks, exacerbating the crisis. Those who arrived yesterday received a €20 Dunnes voucher and were told they would be emailed when the accommodation becomes available. It is scandalous when there are over 160,000 vacant homes in the State that the Government is doing nothing about. Does the Taoiseach accept there is no such thing as an illegal asylum seeker? Everyone has the right to come here and apply for asylum.

Previously, the nearest the clock had been to midnight was 17 minutes, which was at the end of the Cold War. It is now at 90 seconds. That organisation cites specifically the threat of nuclear war as a result of the escalation of the war in Ukraine.  We all know that Putin instigated that war and is the culprit of an unjustified and brutal invasion,but there is no sign whatsoever from the EU or from President von der Leyen - quite the opposite - of an attempt to de-escalate this terrifying situation. That is not in any way to mitigate Putin’s crimes but escalating this war to the possibility of a nuclear conflict is too scary to even think about. That is what the atomic scientists believe. When the Taoiseach looks at tanks and the escalation of this, is he not scared? Does he not think that a neutral country such as Ireland should be calling for the de-escalation of this terrifying conflict?

To go back to the initial question by Deputy Alan Farrell, it is correct to say that there is an improved atmosphere between the European Commission and the UK Government. It is a much better atmosphere, a much better backdrop and a much better mood music than I have seen or heard at any period since Brexit was passed. There is increased trust. I think there is increased flexibility on both sides and there is also increased confidentiality, which is also very important. We have all agreed to make sure that these talks and negotiations can happen in a confidential setting. That is not to say that there are not big differences and gaps; there are. Those gaps will be hard to close and those differences will be hard to resolve. When I spoke with President von der Leyen on the phone, we did not have a chance to discuss REPowerEU but that may well be a topic of discussion on 9 and 10 February. In my conversation with the Prime Minister, Mr. Sunak, we discussed the protocol and I restated our objection to the UK’s legacy legislation, as well as our concerns around the proposed electronic travel authorisation which could adversely affect EU citizens and non-EU citizens trying to go from North to South.  In terms of a timeline for an agreement, there is no definite timeline and there is no deadline. We would all love to see a resolution before the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement or if not, before St. Patrick’s Day. However, I cannot say that this will be possible at this stage. There is no particular deadline in that regard.  On the death penalty, I wish to make clear that Ireland is opposed to the death penalty in any country. However, as a general principle we do not support boycotts and disinvestment because we believe that more can be achieved by engagement. I am not aware of any Irish universities that plan to set up a campus in Saudi Arabia. Obviously, they would have to think for themselves about what might be involved in that. There are Saudi students who come here to study in Ireland. I have met some of them. They are great ambassadors for their country and they are very much welcome here.  Finally, on the refugee crisis, as I said earlier we should not forget the context. We are facing an unprecedented situation with a refugee crisis in Europe the likes of which we have not seen since the Second World War and the likes of which we have never seen in Ireland. Let us not forget that last year, we welcomed almost 100,000 people to Ireland from Ukraine and from other parts of the world. We provided them with shelter, food, heat, light, education for their children, healthcare and, in many cases, employment. We can be proud as a society of what we have done in the past year. There is no lack of compassion from the Government or from the Irish people but there is a lack of capacity. We are doing all we can at the moment to source more accommodation. In the meantime, we have to prioritise and we will be prioritising people coming from Ukraine, as well as people who are not coming here from Ukraine such as children, families, vulnerable adults and, of course, programme refugees. Yet, we cannot guarantee accommodation for everyone who comes to the country unannounced. We will certainly not turn anyone away but we will say to people that if they are thinking of coming to Ireland and if they are in a safe country, if they are in a safe place and if they have accommodation, they need to be aware of the fact that accommodation is not necessarily available in Ireland. People coming here are of all sorts of different status. Citizens from the EU and the UK are free to come here at will, provided they can support themselves. We issue 40,000 work permits every year to people of every colour, race and religion who come here legally. They are allowed to do that and they are extremely welcome. We need them to power our economy and run our public services. It does not matter what their race, religion or colour is. People who come here from Ukraine are beneficiaries of temporary protection under EU law, which is above national law, and have a particular status. Programme refugees, including those coming from Syria, for example, have a particular status. Those who are seeking international protection also have a particular status but it is a different status from the ones that I mentioned.

As provided for in the programme for Government, we are continuing our shared island initiative to deliver benefits for the whole island and work with all communities for a shared future, as underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. This involves unprecedented co-operative all-island investment, through our €1 billion shared island fund, hearing from all communities on how we can practically better share this island into the future and providing a stronger evidence base and analysis of the whole island through a programme of published research. The initiative is being taken forward by Ministers and their Departments on a whole-of-government basis, driven and co-ordinated through the shared island unit, which remains in the Department of the Taoiseach. Over the past two years, the Government has allocated €191 million from the shared island fund to move ahead with long-standing commitments such as the Ulster Canal and the Narrow Water bridge projects and to deliver new all-island investments. These projects respond to common interests and concerns for people right across the island, including climate action, biodiversity, regional development, innovation and deepening our societal connections.  Thus far this year, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, commenced a new €3 million shared island civic society funding scheme. Last week, on 19 January, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced a call for a new €15 million electric vehicle, EV, charging scheme. This will develop a network of publicly accessible, community-focused, EV charging points at sports clubs across the island of Ireland. The Government will seek to undertake significantly more all-island investment co-operation with a new Northern Ireland Executive and with the British Government.  The continuing absence of the Executive and the inability of the North-South Ministerial Council to meet adversely affect what is possible and there is an urgent need to get all of the political institutions of the agreement operating again, including the North-South bodies. I held constructive discussions with the leaders of the five main political parties in Belfast on 12 January and the Government will continue to work with the British Government and with the leaders of the parties in Northern Ireland, to do all we can to have the institutions back up and running as soon as possible.

At this stage, I feel the important thing to concentrate on is the stalled negotiations, which appear to have been stalled for a considerable time. I know that is not the fault of anybody on either side. It is just a circumstance that arose as a result of circumstances outside of the control of this jurisdiction and others. The important thing now, I believe, is that a special effort be made to co-ordinate all thinking within the UK, Northern Ireland and Europe to bring together in a concentrated way the minds of those who are involved, with a view to sharing what we have and what we can share. Community development and support for communities is a huge area that can be moved forward at any time while we are awaiting the return of the Assembly. The most important point is it will also help to speed up the recognition of the Assembly. The last point I want to make is that when negotiations stall, those stalls are usually filled by alternatives.The alternatives that come to mind, in this case, are not necessarily good. I strongly support the line being taken by the Government and ask that, as a matter of urgency, there be an accelerated programme of engagement with society in Northern Ireland in a helpful way, not to overwhelm or overcome the community but simply to encourage them into our way of thinking.

A significant degree of modelling and comparative research has been carried out North and South, although some of that modelling should be expanded into modelling 32-county systems because that is necessary preparatory work that needs to be done. Obviously, that is something that all of us in my part of the world would like to see delivered on and there are considerable gains to be made. I agree with Deputy Durkan that it is vital we get negotiations going and get an Executive up and running and, as the Taoiseach said, that the necessary North-South Ministerial Council meetings be held along with those of all the necessary institutions that relate to the Good Friday Agreement. Beyond that, I think the Taoiseach accepts there is a changed dialogue on this island in regard to Irish unity. The shared island dialogue has not gone to the places it should go in the sense of accepting that this conversation is happening among the general public North and South and among many people who would never have considered Irish unity previously. My party has been straightforward regarding our call whereby we believe that one of the preparatory steps that needs to be taken relates to a citizens' assembly, but I am not especially caught up on what it will be called or will look like as long as it can deliver some facility whereby the people of Ireland, North and South, can have conversations about what the possibilities are for a future 32-county state of which we can all be part. I reiterate Ireland both North and South has changed very much, so it will look very different from what any of us would have considered to be Irish unity 20 or 30 years ago. The Taoiseach is in the driving seat. He has an ability to bring the shared island unit to a place where it should be. What are his plans in that regard?

Tomorrow, there will be further strike action by nurses in the North over a pay cut, in real terms, that they are suffering, where there is extreme demoralisation among nurses and a severe crisis in being able to recruit and retain them because of massive understaffing and so on in hospitals in the North and elsewhere throughout the UK. Does that not sound familiar? Simultaneously, down here, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has suggested industrial action may be necessary because of the catastrophe nurses are facing in the South. I invite the Taoiseach to indicate his support for nurses in the North, who are going on strike to get decent pay, and to recognise the desperate pleas of nurses in our own hospitals, down South, regarding the absolute crisis and demoralisation they face because of chronic under-resourcing, understaffing, a lack of beds and, added to that, the impossibility of finding affordable accommodation for many nurses because of the Government's failure to address the housing crisis.

We call on the Government to consider a citizens' assembly on Irish unity because we believe we need to plan for this. We are not looking to push any community to where they do not want to go. The Taoiseach last week made some very conciliatory comments when he reached out to the unionist community, and that is what we want to do as well. We want to reach out to them and engage with them because we have a vision and, obviously, they have their vision. Our vision is for a united Ireland, and we feel that by having the conversation, we will not push people but engage with them in a positive way to put down their thoughts and feelings along with ours. We need the Executive up and running. I canvassed in the North last year for the Northern Ireland Assembly election. It was an unbelievable election, and I saw Michelle O'Neill emerge as the leader of the Assembly, a position that has not been confirmed but which she obtained because of her fabulous election performance. We believe that with the Taoiseach's support and that of the other parties in the North, we can get the Assembly up and running. It is really important. As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, things that need to happen in the North are being held up because the Executive is not operating, and we have to work on that.

To respond to Deputy Durkan, I absolutely agree there are things we can do to move things forward absent an Assembly and Executive, and the shared island fund is part of that. It is one of the few positive things that is happening North-South at the moment. It is making a difference in Northern Ireland and has been a very successful initiative by the Government, particularly led by the Tánaiste and former Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin. Another thing we are working on is PEACE PLUS, an EU-UK fund of about €1 billion to invest in Northern Ireland and enhance North-South co-operation. We hope to be able to come to an agreement on that in the first half of this year. While I am talking about North-South matters, I restate the Government's support for the A5 project, the new road to be built between Aughnacloy and New Buildings, helping to connect Derry and Letterkenny as well to the rest of the State. It is a very dangerous road. A campaign was relaunched in Northern Ireland only in the past week of which the GAA and other bodies are a part and on which they are showing real leadership. We are keen to see that project through planning. We want to contribute to the cost of it and we are going to make sure we prepare for the tie-ins on our side of the Border, such as the project from Clontibret to the Border. Turning to Deputy Ó Murchú’s questions, in fairness, a lot of the shared island research programme looks at the differences between North and South, such as how health services and primary care services are structured in Northern Ireland as compared with the Republic of Ireland. A lot of that kind of detail, painstaking work and analysis was never done previously. It is being done for the first time and it is important that it continue. I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on one issue. I do not underestimate for a second the enormous pressure our healthcare staff are under, and he will know my family background in that regard. Healthcare staff, nurses among them but also doctors, ambulance staff and others, have had an exhausting three years. There has been the exhaustion and stress of the pandemic, and now that we are in at least a post-restrictions period, there is a huge snapback in demand for healthcare. They have had no respite or break. A lot of people are burned out. That is not at all unique to this jurisdiction, as he said, or to this island; it is a feature of health services across the world. We are acting on it. We have a pay deal in place with our healthcare workers. We have a new consultant contract on offer, which I think is a very good one and a very generous one financially. Crucially, it begins to end private practice in public hospitals, something the Deputy agrees with. We are increasing the number of beds, with almost 1,000 additional beds in our acute hospitals in the past three years, and we are recruiting, with more than 6,000 more doctors and nurses working in our public hospitals than was the case three years ago, notwithstanding the challenges with recruitment. In respect of a citizens’ assembly on unification or Irish unity, as Deputies described it, I have an open mind on that but I am not convinced it is the right approach. I have seen citizens' assemblies work well in this jurisdiction, and while I was initially a sceptic of them, I have become a fan, and I think they have allowed us to bring forward reforms we not have brought forward so fast had it not been for the fact the citizens' assemblies showed us that when the public hear the arguments, they are often ahead of politicians. Doing it on this issue, however, would require a lot of thought and sensitivity. One simple question is whether it would involve 50 people from the Republic and 50 from Northern Ireland or whether it would be done on the basis there would be a 5:2 split. I do not know. Any citizens' assembly that did not have the active and meaningful participation of people from the Protestant, unionist and loyalist backgrounds would not be worth having. It would not be worth a penny candle, quite frankly, if people from those backgrounds were not willing to participate. If 16, 17 or 20 of them agreed to do so, would they face intimidation, potentially, for being involved in an assembly of that nature? They might. As we know, citizens' assemblies have a lot of votes. Would the rules allow them to be outvoted or would they have a veto? Until we have satisfactory answers to those kind of practical questions, I do not think it is an idea we could proceed with.

This is to enable funding to be made available for the purposes of maintaining the post office network and to counter the consequences upon An Post of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, to change the Title of the Bill and make other consequential amendments required to take accounts of the changes above. The purpose of this motion is to instruct the Dáil in committee that Standing Order 233(2) is modified to provide that the committee has the power to make amendments to the Communications Regulation Bill 2022 which are outside the existing subject matter of the Bill. This is required so that I can introduce Government amendments to the Bill on Report Stage. Deputies may recall that on Second Stage, on 5 October, I noted the possibility that the Government would bring forward a short amendment to the Postal and Telecommunications Act 1983 to provide for payments to be made to or via An Post, particularly in the context of support to postmasters. I also referenced this on Committee Stage on 26 October. As indicated, the proposed amendments would provide a legal base for the provision of funding from the Minister to the post office network and An Post, specifically the provision of €10 million per annum to the post office network over a three-year period from 2023 to 2025 to support a sustainable nationwide post office network and the transfer of funding granted under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve from the Minister to An Post as compensation for the impact of Brexit on the company. The context for the provision of funding to the post office network is the Government decision of 31 May 2022, which stated that €10 million per annum will be provided to the post office network over a three-year period, a fixed-term from 2023 to 2025, to support a sustainable nationwide post office network in line with the commitment to the Programme for Government. This funding aims to ensure access to important socially-valuable services across the post office network and that there is a network of sufficient scale in place for the public to access these services across the country. This intervention will support the existing network of approximately 900 post offices and will provide the necessary time for new commercial initiatives and services to develop. It brings sustainability and certainty for postmasters and addresses concerns around potential reduction in accessibility to services. The EU's Brexit Adjustment Reserve aims to provide support to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. An Post has successfully submitted an application via the Department for funding relating to the management of the EU customs and VAT requirements applying to all An Post UK traffic following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. This important change in international trade has had a significant negative impact on the postal sector in Ireland. Brexit also coincided with long-planned extensive changes to EU customs regulations governing goods entering and leaving the EU. All traffic from the UK was previously categorised as intra-EU and became non-EU and subject to customs-related obligations, which directly impacted An Post operationally and commercially. The proposed amendment is required to provide a legal basis for the funding granted under the EU regulation to be directed from the Minister to An Post as compensation for the impact of Brexit on the company. The specific terms and conditions under which funding is to be provided to the post office network, under subsection (1), and An Post, under subsection (2), remain subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I look forward to our debate on the motion and I will do my best to respond to any specific questions.

I welcome this motion and thank the Minister of State for bringing it forward. We will have an opportunity later on Report Stage to have further discussion on it. I commend those involved on getting us to this point. This has been a particular focus of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications. There have been numerous debates in this House over the last number of years regarding the future viability and sustainability of our post office network. I commend the Ministers and the Departments, particularly the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, and their representatives, who engaged with representatives across the political spectrum in a range of forums and put their case strongly and clearly forward regarding what they saw as needed to ensure the viability of the network. In other areas, issues came up during debates and were raised by representative groups and An Post regarding offline services. There was an inter-departmental review. Enough is not coming from that as regards offline services. I support the proposition that there is significant opportunity for An Post and post offices to deliver offline services.This is particularly the case in the area of ID verification. The post office service has the technology, the physical footprint in the communities the length and breadth of Ireland and there remains significant opportunity in those areas. My colleague will pick up on more recent developments in respect of the price of stamps and other matters but I will conclude by saying that I welcome the motion, look forward to the debate later on, and more importantly, look forward to this funding being distributed to the post office network in a fair manner to ensure the viability of it. That will be matter which will need constant review, update and engagement because the post office network is of great importance to communities for so many reasons.
#RuairiOmurchu	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-party	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-dob	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-25 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	237	As Deputy O’Rourke said, we welcome this motion. It is fair to say that there has been a considerable number of conversations in respect of the post office and its network and this discussion has been around sustainability and viability. We all saw the great, and spectacular work in some cases, which has been done over many years but, particularly during the pandemic, by the post offices. If a message was needed in respect of the complete necessity of this network and the cornerstone it provides, that was it. We all use post office services in urban settings but this is particularly the case in rural centres. We are talking about rural centres which have been detrimentally impacted by the loss of Garda stations, the local public house or whatever other service as has been the case over many years. We have had many debates and a considerable amount of work has been done, as has been mentioned by Deputy O’Rourke, by the Irish Postmasters' Union. Many of us here would have spoken about the Grant Thornton report. The whole idea behind that was to look at how much money we needed to put in to individual post offices and into the network to provide the money and the means by which we would be able to keep the system afloat. We are almost tired speaking here about sustainability and viability but this is a definite step in the right direction. Once again, over the past number of days we are also dealing with the issues in respect of State aid and the rules surrounding it. I liked being able to see that we were able to find a solution here. On an ancillary point, I request that we find that sort of a solution in the future, rather than the madness we have in respect of Gresham House and where Coillte is at the minute. That is not something we like to see. There is a complete necessity in respect of postal services. Deputy O’Rourke spoke about State services and I know the Irish Postmasters' Union, An Post, and others have spoken about the necessity of looking at tendering rules in respect of a greater amount of State services being made available and which could be offered through the post office network. We all welcome the greater amount of services which can be offered, such as post offices operating as a green hub, together with the financial services which can be provided, including banking services. Over the summer we had the threats of further closures of banks in rural areas and small towns, in particular, and saw what is the general trajectory. While we may not accept that, particularly from our pillar banks, there is a need where people live in very close proximity to post offices that they have that sort of facility. We need to look at post offices being able to offer those sorts of services. We all know, however, that the world in respect of postal services has completely changed and that, to some degree, people do not send letters. When people receive a letter it can be a huge thing. From a political point of view or in respect of an invitation, it sometimes works when one can get something hand-delivered. The danger at this time is that we know that there is a cost-of-living crisis and that there are issues in respect of businesses and whatever, but the extra 10 cent postal charge is not something we need to see. This is on top of the previous increases, I believe, last March. I understand that comparisons will have been done in respect of prices across Europe and the rest of the world in respect of postal services but we do not need to put more pressure on the system. The Irish Postmasters' Union was very strong and forthright in what it said, which is that we do not need fewer items being posted. We all know that the parcel delivery system is something that is here for the near future in respect of online purchases, but we need to ensure that the core business is sound. A great amount of services in respect of the post office need to be looked at and, inasmuch as this is a step in the right direction, including where more moneys can be taken through the post office network in offering services from the State, banking services and green hub services. That would definitely move us to a place where there would be less need for State aid and we would have a more sustainable system. That is a place to which we definitely need to go.

As a Deputy from the rural constituency of Galway East, I have experienced over the years post offices closing in our area and the amount of upset it causes to a community. This is a symptom of what can happen when the service is not being supported properly from central level. What we now have we should hold in respect of the post office network. We should freeze any more closures of post offices in rural Ireland and if the postmaster is giving the licence up, every effort should be made to put somebody else in place to keep the facilities going. I welcome the funding that is being made available but I hope that funding gets to the network on the ground rather than being held at An Post executive or national level. The Irish Postmasters' Union has done a great job over the years in highlighting the issues within the postal service in how it is trying to keep a business going against all of the tides. The roll-out of the off-line services which have been talked about should be given to and carried out by the post offices. I am aware that there were issues around procurement, but we need to get going with that. Rural Ireland is facing a new post-Covid 19 crisis with the number of pubs which are closing which were a social centre for people to meet. Many community groups are becoming resilient in light of the fact that they are losing some of their services, including the local pub, which was very important as an economic driver in the area. As politicians, we have it within our gift to ensure that we strengthen the post office network so that it becomes sustainable and, as one of the other speakers said, so that into the future we do not have to be offering supports for it to become a viable proposition for a postmaster. In this area, there is the idea of a one-stop-shop for services such as motor taxation, passport services, which the postal service is already carrying, and social welfare services. We should make every effort in every Government Department to ensure that any payments and services which are coming from social welfare are offered, in the first instance, to the post office service and that every form should have the post office as its first option. This would link people to the post office, which is very important. Post offices and postmasters need guidance and funding to refocus the model of their business to the modern times we have. Parcel deliveries and online services are great but there is still a cohort of people who are not up to speed with the online service and are not, so to speak, computer literate. It is important that service can be provided at the local post office, whether it is applying for a grant from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, or whatever, with the assistance of its staff to ensure that it can be done online, because we seem to be driving everybody online now, for better or for worse.We have lost many of our Garda barracks in rural areas. That is a legacy issue. We have lost enough and it is important the post office service is retained. We should be promoting services in post offices and what is available in them. Over recent years, retail banks have closed a lot of branches in rural areas and have left the market, including banks such as Ulster Bank. It is important we make sure we have a vibrant post office network to take up some of that slack. I commend postmen and postwomen who, over the past two or three years since Covid first struck this country, showed leadership, which was important to the country. They were probably the first point of contact for many people living in rural areas. They knocked on doors and asked people if they were okay, whether they needed anything from the shop, if somebody had called, whether the heating was on and whatever else. They went beyond the call of duty to make sure they were providing a service. That came naturally to postmen and postwomen, and it is important we acknowledge that as something specific to rural Ireland. That experience has also shone a light on how the post office service in our cities and urban areas was able to do the same during Covid. The post office network is an important national asset. It is something we should be proud of and help to develop. The move by the Minister of State today is to provide funding, on which I commend him. Funding is badly needed and we need to make sure it gets to the people who need it, right down to post office level. We need to make sure it is not lost in transit. In respect of rural crime, we do not have rural Garda barracks and gardaí are not on the ground. The person who is looking out when passing in a green van is the postman or postwoman. Given they are familiar with an area, they will alert somebody if they see something peculiar or strange. That has not been accounted for, but it helps a lot in rural Ireland to keep everybody safe in their homes, as well as keeping property safe. Well done to the Minister of State and he has my support.

It is required to bring into law the extension of the powers of ComReg to compensate customers and impose fines on companies that do not keep up their side of a contract. The Bill will give civil enforcement powers to ComReg where there are disputes about utilities and will also give customers protection. If people terminate a contract and change providers, they are often billed twice. There needs to be accountability. ComReg needs to have enforcement powers and be able to fine companies. It needs to have the power to deal with companies that do not stop direct debits. We know how important post offices are in our communities. They are the centre of any community, in terms of postage, pensions and everything else. The banking sector is now using post offices. The post office in Croom closed recently, and luckily Padraig Broderick in Spar took it on. It could not be taken on as a viable business in itself, because it was not viable. We could not lose it because of the people who used it. The shops in the area made it viable. If we want post offices to be sustainable, people have to be paid properly for the transactions that go through them. We need to make them a viable single entity for the future of all post offices. I would like to make sure any services provided through post offices are a viable option to future-proof post offices and communities. People need to be paid properly for the work they do.

We have had more promises and announcements about oifigí poist and postmasters and postmistresses than we have had hot dinners. It is to be hoped this will be meaningful, tangible and provide real supports, rather than nice glossy brochures which tell people what they will have. Live, horse, and you will get grass. People are pushed out. As we know, postmistresses and postmasters operate on a pittance. The basic amount they get is little or nothing. They get a certain amount per transaction. They are being squeezed. We have quoted letters from the Department of Social Protection, which instructed people to get their money through banks. Banks have exited most towns and are cashless. Of the four cash machines in the centre of Clonmel last weekend, three were out of order because the banks do not want to fix or do anything with them. They do not care about the ordinary people. Post offices have saved many people. The late Johnny Grady from the Nire in Hollyford was making wreaths and went missing. He did not turn up at a post office one week. Fuair sé bás sna coillte. He was dead in the woods. The postmistress missed him. They miss people and look after the community, from a crime point of view or whatever. We have problems with CCTV. Post offices normally have their own CCTV and gardaí check it and everything else. I could not say enough about postmistresses and postmasters who have done so much to help people, in particular the elderly. Young people have been tricked and fooled into doing everything online. What will happen when there are cyberattacks, crashes and a cashless society, which is what the Government wants?

Anything that relates to the security of post offices is important. The post office sector has gone through quite a lot in recent years, with little Government aid or attention. I see the same in my village, Goleen, which lost the post office few months ago. Only two or three weeks after losing it, the now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, who was a Minister at the time, turned up for a photo in the village and stood outside a post office which was on the verge of being closed. He showed no action in terms of saving it when he was there. The bottom line is that it is not a viable business. People find themselves in a very serious situation. Unfortunately, the people in Durrus are finding themselves in the same crisis because there is an advertisement seeking a postmaster or postmistress to take over the post office. An Post is expecting too much. It needs to deliver a postal service in communities where there is nobody to take up that service until someone comes along. I congratulate Wendy Briscoe and present company in Schull who took over the running of the post office which was up for grabs at the same time as the Goleen one was closed. The loss of a post office in a community is devastating. People tell me Goleen is now like a ghost village on Fridays. People move on to the next town, which is a sad fact we are facing. It is time to compensate people who are running these businesses because they will not be viable. An Opposition Deputy in west Cork put all sorts of things on Facebook about Goleen being a beautiful place to come and live. People cannot live on air. They must live on an income. That would make it viable to run a business, and unfortunately that was not the case in Goleen.

Anything in the Bill that will improve the lot of consumers is something I would welcome. As the owner of a small rural post office, I see at first hand the importance of our local post office and the good work post offices do. Supporting that network is very important. The Government, to much fanfare, announced it would support post offices. This is a very important point. It said it would compensate them by means of a package. Unfortunately, the package has not yet been delivered, as the Minister of State knows. It is a little bit like the cheque being in the post, when one has to keep looking to see when it is coming. The promise of money does not keep a business open.This Government is promising and promising but it is not delivering.

We saw what happened in the UK. They got rid of a lot of their post offices, more than half of them, and now they are trying to bring them back into existence again. We must do our best to retain the post offices we have left because they are vital to local communities. Elderly people go to the post office for their pensions and social welfare payments. I ask the Minister of State, as I have asked previously, to give more work to the post offices. It is not money they want; it is work. We have asked previously about banking services that could be operated through the post office network, a form of community banking where the profits would go back into communities. We asked the Government to do that before and we are asking again now. We cannot afford to lose any more post offices over and above those we have already lost.

The purpose of the Bill is to transpose the EU directive and the Bill, accordingly, is limited to the scope of third countries and excludes the EU and associated countries, the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. The substitution of "third party" for "third country" broadens the scope of the Bill and would mean the Bill would apply to the EU and associated countries. The amendments must, therefore, be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 187(1) as they are outside the scope of the Bill.

As the nature and focus of the work of the agency necessarily narrows during the period ahead of dissolution, there is a lower requirement for a board size originally provided for in the Digital Hub Development Agency Act. Amendment No. 60 also proposes a reduction in the number required for a quorum, from six to four. This will permit for a continued functioning board throughout the dissolution process and mitigate against the risk of the board becoming inquorate during the wind-down and dissolution period. There are currently eight members on the board of the Digital Hub Development Agency, DHDA. The membership at present comprises six men and two women, a breakdown of 75% male and 25% female. Departments are required, in line with the Government decision of 23 July 2014, to achieve the target of at least 40% for representation of each gender on State boards.

We sometimes deal with communities that have not necessarily been dealt a fair hand by the State through many years. All present know the reality of what needs to be done in such communities. We all know the real way of dealing with problems such as poverty and associated issues is through education and employment. Where there are projects that are working, facilitating people and engaging with them, that should be sustained. We need more such projects. Consideration has to be given to these sorts of projects, particularly those that are technologically based, whether they are training schemes or projects that otherwise engage with communities. Certain people come from different places and sometimes a huge amount of preliminary work is necessary. One could be dealing with people who may have dropped out of education at a very early stage and have an unease and, let us say, a lack of confidence in that regard. One has to create the conditions where those people feel safe and secure in order to build up that confidence and provide them with the necessary skill sets. That is how we can bridge those gaps. Dealing with that wider issue would require a significant number of interventions the State has failed to provide, some of which relate to wholesale early interventions for families and communities. That could almost break the poverty trap with which we are dealing. I reiterate the point that there is unease in respect of what is being proposed here. There is an onus on the Government to realise that and to look at the possibilities it may have in the future of engaging with the community and all the necessary stakeholders and then looking at worthwhile projects. What we are talking about here is bridging those gaps. It is about creating a more level playing field and providing people with skills, roadmaps and through-paths into education and employment. Some of that will require heavy lifting by the Government. It has been a failing of this State for many years. Unless we want to continue with some of the current circumstances in communities that have been disadvantaged, the State will have to get its hands dirty. The Minister of State needs to consider what is being taken away here and what is a best-case scenario that can be provided back to these communities.

There is a vital role for the Government in education in IT. It is our investment for the future in a successful economy. We need to educate people and provide them with the skills they need for a knowledge economy. That is a focus and responsibility for the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, among others. We have to make sure we are regenerating locations such as the urban centre in which the DHDA was located. The plan for that area is for it to become mixed-use development with a lot of housing, led by the Land Development Agency, LDA. I look forward to the regeneration that will bring to the Guinness centre. I visited the site recently. Guinness showed me the other development plans it has for the area, including for the other side of the street. There is also a role for the Government in supporting start-ups, including high-tech start-ups, in order to catch up with the start-up culture that exists on the west coast of the US. I have been collaborating with ministers of other European countries, including Portugal and France, on how we can make sure our start-ups scale.

Technology and start-ups are vital but sometimes there is a fundamental piece that has to be done with regard to communities and some of those who have not necessarily had a perfect roadmap through the education system and have become somewhat distant from it. I accept what the Minister of State is saying regarding regeneration. Everybody accepts we are in a housing crisis and all the rest of it and there is an absolute need for accommodation but we also need to address the fundamental flaws in the context of the failure of the State to deliver for these communities through many years.We are probably trying to do something now that is more difficult than it would have been 20 or 30 years ago, given the other conditions that prevail, particularly in big urban settings under the cosh owing to issues that exist throughout this State and island and most of the modern world, such as organised crime and drug use. These issues affect communities in particular, but we have to facilitate people to escape poverty. The only way we can do that is by engaging with the communities, putting in the supports necessary and then bringing people to a place where we can provide for the engagements required, whether they relate to technology training or other types of education and training, and then provide employment. Employment is the big one that can change people's lives altogether.

I may be incorrect on the matter but I ask the Acting Chairman to rule on it nonetheless. Parts of this Bill involve a draw on the Exchequer. A money message was provided when the Bill initially went through Committee Stage but there were many amendments made. There was a new Part 3 introduced with regard to high-risk vendors etc. Anything the Minister does under that measure will involve a cost to the Exchequer because compensation will be payable in accordance with the optional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Netherlands, among other countries, has acknowledged that. We are implementing similar procedures here. The digital hub elements were also introduced after completion of Committee Stage. My understanding is that no subsequent money message was provided for the Bill. I may be wrong on that and would welcome clarification. If it is the case, I do not see how this Bill can proceed at this stage without a money message to cover the costs that would accrue from the amendments made on Committee Stage. I do not believe there was a subsequent money message but I am open to correction.

Is it not proposed to transfer it? That would involve works by the Chief State Solicitor's Office. If I am wrong and if the Minister of State is happy to assure the House that there are no ancillary costs, such as conveyancing costs, I will stand corrected. The more significant aspect pertains to the high-risk vendor, the compensation that will arise therefrom and the lack of a money message in that regard. I would have thought that even the Digital Hub Development Agency would require a money message.

Some Bills involve a cost to the Exchequer but some do not. Engaging in conveyancing or compensating third parties where you are basically banning pieces of infrastructure lawfully included up to that point will not be covered by the money message because the money message relates to the Bill when it was first to proceed to Committee Stage. Rather than do it all in a transparent manner and deal with it, the Minister of State, particularly in amendments around the end of October, gave us amendments the night before Committee Stage, but there was no subsequent money message to account for that.

That decision noted that the amendment of the Post and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 would be required to provide a legal basis for the provision of funding from the Minister to An Post. A further Government decision, on 29 November, approved the drafting of an amendment to the Post and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 for inclusion in the Communications Regulation Bill 2022. The proposed amendment, No. 61, through subsection (1), will allow this financial support to be provided via An Post to the existing network of approximately 900 post offices. This funding will provide the necessary time for new commercial initiatives and services to develop, bring sustainability and certainty for postmasters and address concerns around any potential reduction in accessibility to services. The EU's Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, aims to provide support to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. An Post has successfully submitted an application for funding of approximately €24 million from the BAR in relation to the management of EU customs and VAT requirements applying to all An Post UK traffic following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. This important change in international trade has had a significant negative impact on the postal sector in Ireland. Brexit also coincided with long-planned extensive changes to EU customs regulations governing goods entering and leaving the EU. All traffic from the UK that was previously categorised as intra-EU became non-EU traffic and subject to customs-related obligations, which directly impacted on An Post operationally and commercially. The proposed amendment, in subsection (2), is required to provide a legal base for the funding granted under the EU regulation to be directed from the Minister to An Post as compensation for the impact of Brexit on the company. The proposed amendment, in subsection (3), ensures that the specific terms and conditions under which funding is to be provided to the post office network under subsection (1) and An Post under subsection (2) remain subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Amendment No. 2 is a consequential amendment to the Long Title to the Bill to reflect the inclusion of amendment No. 61.

It is caught in one term: "sustainability". We all know the benefits provided by the post office network and the network's absolute necessity, particularly in rural communities that have lost many of their hubs. We welcome the fact that we are talking about the €10 million but it is a matter of ensuring it makes it exactly to where it needs to go. It is a matter of a fair break-up for the postmasters. We have to commend the work done by a number of the stakeholders, particularly the Irish Postmasters Union. As I said previously, they put their money where their mouths are. We had the Grant Thornton report on what was necessary for sustainability. If anyone needed a lesson on the necessity of the post office network, that was provided during the Covid pandemic. We are all aware of the huge impact of the closure of a post office on a community. Therefore, it is all about sustainability. I welcome that we were able to deal with the issues regarding state aid.Other issues have been dealt with in the House regarding Coillte. We need to be able to bring about a similar solution there, whereby the likes of Coillte can be able to draw down money itself and does not necessarily need the help - for the want of a better term - of the likes of Gresham House. I imagine it is a particular help that Gresham House will do better from in the long run. Anyway, I digress, which I tend to do from time to time. This is highly positive. It is an absolute necessity but whether we are talking about driver licences and everything right through from social protection to passports, perhaps we can look at those State services that can be provided within post offices. Again, we have heard from An Post and we have heard from the Irish Postmasters' Union previously about the need to look at the tendering process and to take into account the social dividend provided by the post office and the post office network. We need to be able to allow them to tender in a fair and equitable way. That is something we need to bring about. There is an obvious gain in this from the State's point of view. We all like the idea of the green digital hub where people can come to access necessary services, where they may be more comfortable going to the post office to access these services than they would be in other places. Across the summer we had AIB and the possibility of the mass closures of a huge number of banking services across all our pillar banks. It is a fight that needs to be had. We need to ensure we maintain a necessary number of banks. Outside of that, there are financial services that can be provided, and are being provided at this point in time. A greater number of them can be provided by our post office network. This is my point. If we can get these services, then we can have a post office network that is making far more money and, in deriving that money it would, eventually, not need the state aid. We could get to that sustainable point in time. Obviously, it also means that from a business point of view, we make the post office a far more saleable entity than it is, unfortunately, for a considerable number of people out there who are under pressure. The reason we have so many in operation at this point is down to the commitment of a lot of postmasters in their communities. This is why we have this necessary legislation in front of us. It is something we need to do but long term we need to ensure we can make them more sustainable. The idea is that they would provide services and would be paid a fair price for the services, and this would facilitate everybody. It is fair to say that I have an issue with the An Post proposal for a 10 cent increase in the price of a stamp. There has already been an increase in the cost of postage over the past year. My fear, and it is a fear the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, has put in the public domain also, is that we do not need an even smaller number of people to utilise the absolutely necessary postage system. Many people of a particular age not only have a certain grá for it, but sometimes they have a certain need for it too. It is the way they deal with State services and with other necessary services. It is a way that we can make sure people get informed of certain things. We do not need to put added costs onto other State agencies, and we do not need to pass costs onto individuals, and we certainly do not need to be putting pressure on businesses at a time like this. We are all aware that things have changed in that area as there are multiple means of communication now that were not available years ago. Due to online purchasing, and whatever else, there is a completely different structure around the delivery of packages and so on. In this context there have been certain gains and certain losses for the post office network. First and foremost we are in support of this legislation. We need to ensure that it happens as quickly as possible and that the money goes to where it needs to go, and that it ensures we maintain the post office network we have at this point in time. This does not fall just within the Minister of State's remit. There has been a huge amount of engagement on this, and especially at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, from the point of view of ensuring that post offices are able to offer multiple services, and that some of these would be State services. The post offices could offer the service and get paid for it and we could have a more sustainable post office network, and we would be all the better for it.

This is to amend a cross-referencing error, which had previously read "a direction under section 32(2),”.", and which now reads "a direction under section 33(2),”." I am introducing amendment No. 5 in order to define a “high-risk vendor measure”, of which eight measures are listed in section 25. Amendment No. 6 is required for these subsections to be defined as regulatory breaches under the Bill when enacted. The amendment will add these new subsections to the definition of regulatory breach. The definition will now mean that a failure to comply with these measures is a regulatory breach and subject to the administrative sanction process set out in Part 7 of the Bill. Under section 33(2), ComReg may serve a direction on a provider requiring them to show information that they have complied with a high-risk vendor measure and if they have not complied to explain why not, to submit a possible security audit, and to bear any costs associated with that audit. Amendment No. 7 is required to clarify that a person affected by a high-risk vendor measure or a variation of such a measure can only challenge the decision through an appeal to the High Court. This amendment is required to ensure consistency with the policy objectives and other similar provisions in the Bill, as currently an appeal of a measure under Part 2, security of networks and services, does not exclude the traditional judicial review but does allow the High Court to grant remedies on the basis of what might be called judicial review assessments. I am not able to accept amendment No. 8 where the Deputy seeks "to delete "electronic communications networks or electronic communications services” and substitute “public 5G telecommunication networks”, as this would narrow the scope of the legislation and what it is setting out to achieve. This is future-facing legislation and it must be flexible to deal with emerging threats. It would be unwise to limit the legislation to just 5G networks prior to having carried out the risk assessment set forth in this section. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 9. This would delete the definition of "high-risk vendor" from the interpretation of Part 3. I earlier introduced an amendment for the definition of “high-risk vendor measure” to follow the definition of “high-risk vendors". Both definitions have the meaning given to them in individual sections and it would not make sense to remove any of these from the interpretation sections.

We all get the idea of the changed geopolitical set-up in the world. We are all aware that the State, in the context of security, requires the necessary powers to ensure that communication networks are protected.However, we need some sort of clarity on how decisions and determinations will be made. There is much talk about information as being provided by intelligence services and of course we will be dealing with a large number of people who have skin in the game. Beyond that, I am always afraid when the power lies solely with the Minister. For example, what if an action is chosen to be taken in respect of components that cannot be used in communications technology?. We are going to have to understand why this is the case. We are definitely going to need some reasoning behind it. I understand the Minister might not be able to offer all the information into the public domain but there has to be some form of accountability. We cannot just have a Minister making decisions on this willy-nilly. There was often talk in Europe in recent years about strategic autonomy. The issue was thrown up by Covid as regards semi-conductors, that we did not have the pool and supply chain that was necessary to deliver. We are still dealing with that now. We all understand the need for strategic autonomy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We need to be able to maintain our communication devices and provide components in the wider world. I understand in respect of some of the companies that would fall under this - the high-risk vendor - that there are not many companies in Europe that can provide the alternative. They would probably need to do a significant amount of work to get themselves to that place from a technological point of view and in ensuring that they can provide the supply chain that would be necessary. Then we are getting into the wider question, if we are talking about taking communication components in and out. We are told that the core parts of some of these communication networks would not be using components provided by a high-risk vendor. That is information I have been given but I accept the Government will be carrying out an audit in respect of when they would be looking at carrying out something like this. We would need to make sure this could be done over a realistic period if it was necessary. I imagine if there is a high cost we would have to look at how the added costs would impact on those companies. I have no doubt there then would be talk of compensation and all the rest of it. I would like the Minister of State to go into some detail on that. I accept it might not be possible to provide all the details, even if a decision was made that a high-risk vendor would not be used and its components could not be used in our telecommunications infrastructure. However, I would like to think we would be provided with some information, that there would be some element of accountability and it would not be just a Minister making a decision. I would hope we would have some sight of the information leading to such a decision. I assume there could be a fear about our control or a security issue in respect of our communication infrastructure. We all get the idea of how important communication infrastructure is. If some of us do not, we live in the age of hybrid attacks, cyber-warfare and almost cyber-to-physical attacks in this day and age. We know we need to look after our physical and digital infrastructure. We need to ensure it is protected in all ways. We need to make sure we can actually do this, that we do not leave ourselves in a logistical nightmare and that there is some element of oversight of what would be massive decisions. I doubt they would be made with just business consideration. I imagine there would be geopolitical concerns and relationships with countries of origin and so on that would be impacted by all of this. I would like to think decisions would be made on the basis of high-grade information that could be trusted, that was verified as much as possible and that we would be dealing with something logistically possible if this was necessary. A great many pieces need to fall into place first. The biggest of them is that if we made a determination tomorrow not to use one particular high-risk vendor, we might not be able to replace all those pieces. We should see if others are doing what we are doing. In the US they have made moves of a similar nature. We need to look at the means and process by which Government is going to make this determination. I do not like the idea that it is just the Minister who would have the power. We would need to see some decent protocols and there would need to be oversight by this House and by others in respect of the information that might lead to a possible call. What can we do from a technological point of view to enable ourselves to do this without impacting severely on our communications infrastructure? There are some big issues there and the Minister of State has to provide clarity to the House.

I do not know if his concerns extend to the whole Part but mine certainly do. As I previously stated, not only have I concern with the content of it, I also have a major concern with the process by which it was passed. As Deputy Ó Murchú pointed out, where the power is given to the Minister to proscribe a certain so-called high-risk vendor, it means any communications network will have to take it out of its network. That will involve a cost, of course. It was previously determined to be absolutely lawful and then suddenly it has become unlawful. Arguably they will incur a cost, almost certainly they will, and it will have to be borne by somebody. In Ireland it is usually the taxpayers who bear the cost, whether it is defective apartments, defective concrete blocks or using materials from a high-risk vendor. Somebody is going to carry the can and it is invariably going to be the taxpayer. I had a look at this issue of money messages. The purpose of a Bill has to be recommended to the House before it goes to Committee Stage. If the purpose changes, and of course it was completely changed by Part 3, then it follows that a new money message is required. Be that as it may, the Acting Chair has ruled on it. It does seem to me to be problematic. The problem flows not from the Acting Chair's determination but the manner in which the Minister chose to implement this. Amendments were brought to committee the night before it was to hear them. It was not possible to put down amendments to those amendments or even to properly scrutinise them. There was no revised explanatory memorandum. To this day there is no explanatory memorandum. There is a standing order to the effect that the Chair can require an explanatory memorandum to be provided. That can be done at any stage. There is an explanatory memorandum for the Bill but it did not include this. I suppose somebody decided not to bother our little minds in the House with this as it is high-level geopolitics. They decided to deal with it in that manner rather than have it debated here in the House. There is no explanatory memorandum. Does the Acting Chair wish to have an explanatory memorandum so that the House can fully understand what it is voting for? It is important that the House knows what it is voting for; it is the essence of a democracy. It is why we have this Chamber and why people are elected to it.

I raised the definition of high-risk vendor with the Minister on Committee Stage in the committee room.It had been inserted the night before, so there was not a great deal of time to analyse it, but we were assured it was common in this type of legislation across the EU and that we were implementing an EU framework. When I asked whether there was particular legislation, I was told there was. The Minister of State's officials were kind enough to send me translations from which they were working. I appreciated that greatly, but when I went through them, I found the term "high-risk vendor" nowhere. Maybe I missed it, as there was a great deal of legislation. There was legislation from practically every EU member state, but none of them used the term "high-risk vendor". Will the Minister of State point to another country that uses it specifically? He will not disagree with me when I say it is a pejorative term. No one would like to be labelled a high-risk vendor, even in a Sunday market, much less in the corporate world that the Bill is seeking to regulate. If someone is labelled a high-risk vendor, it will have implications. Name countries that use this term. Why did the Minister of State decide to use such a pejorative term? It is unusually pejorative for legislation, particularly legislation affecting companies that are, by definition, based outside Ireland. Pejorative terms have the habit of spiralling into conflicts. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not mean armed conflicts, but trade conflicts. People get upset. Is there no better terminology that could be used? What countries use this terminology and why is the Government using it? Are we considering amendments Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive?

On Committee Stage, I asked the Chairman of the committee to ask the Minister of State to provide an explanatory memorandum. The Chairman did not do so but, to be fair to him, he said he was sure the Minister of State would come forward with a detailed explanation of what Ireland was doing, why we were doing it and which other countries were doing the same. While I received a mountain of legislation from other countries, I received very little by way of explanation. One should not rely on rumours in the House, but I have heard rumours that the American ambassador was in a couple of times and had a particular interest in this Bill. Every embassy across the land has an interest in what we are doing. I sometimes wonder why, but that is the case. There is nothing untoward about an embassy taking a particular interest, but I would be concerned if that was being done not on the basis of national security, but on the basis of an economic realignment of the State that has not been discussed. I would like to know the Minister of State's reasons. In the absence of those, we will fall back on hearsay, innuendo and rumour.

The legislation as written provides for independent judicial oversight as well as consultation throughout the process. Where a vendor is designated, an independent judge can overturn that. The power does not rest solely with the Minister, which is not how other countries implemented the same objective. Instead, they made it so that their respective ministers solely could make a designation. In Ireland, a judge will be involved. The courts will have oversight and there will be consultation throughout. This provision is based on the EU process. In other words, it will be fair, non-discriminatory and transparent to the maximum extent without impacting national security. The criteria come from the EU toolbox, which uses the phrase "high-risk supplier". That is the origin of our terminology. Deputy McNamara and other Deputies have complained to me in recent weeks about this specific wording, saying it is pejorative or inflammatory. Deputy McNamara asked me directly about which other countries used this term. The Netherlands was asked to change its term and it changed it to "untrusted vendors". I do not know how that is better. The UK uses the phrase "relevant vendor". Austria uses the phrase "designated high-risk vendors". The phrase in the EU toolbox, which is the template for how countries make their laws, is "high-risk supplier". Leaving aside the nomenclature, the main point is that these countries are all using the same criteria from the EU toolbox. This is EU-led legislation. It came from the EU. I discussed with the Commissioner and European ministers what the criteria were and what objectives we were trying to achieve. This designation of vendors could apply to a vendor in any country outside the EEA and the UK, for example, in the US. I will not call it an insinuation, but Deputy McNamara referred to a rumour about the US ambassador having a say in this legislation. I met the US ambassador in July and she did not mention it to me. The matter did not come up in conversation.

We know the issues with court services, which are insufficiently resourced. Will the Minister of State go into some detail about the consultations he mentioned? All of this comes with the caveat of national security, which presumably allows for the gazumping of a large amount of oversight of the relevant information. I am jumping the gun in that regard, though, for want of a better term. Will the Minister of State provide details of what the consultation would look like in terms of the assessment of someone as a high-risk vendor and the carrying out of the nuclear option of removing the material from particular communications infrastructure? While strategic autonomy is important in this day and age, I am led to believe that, if we were to take a particular vendor out of the equation in the morning, we would encounter technological difficulties and could end up dealing with companies that were not at the same technological level. Some of these components are being used because experts in the field believe they are the best in the business. If we are to go down this road, though, I want to know what the process will be, what conversations there have been across the EU about delivering along the supply chain, and what the story is with the information behind this provision. The only story that makes sense is that there are security questions. How much information would be before the House, in the public domain or wherever else? What is the possibility of there being oversight, consultation or whatever one wants to call it?

I am aware from responses to parliamentary questions that the ambassador met the Taoiseach several times since. I do not know whether this matter was discussed with the Taoiseach, but I do not wish to go down that rabbit hole. My primary concern has to do with the Minister of State's reference to oversight mechanisms, including the oversight provided by the courts. This is the main problem with the Bill. It does not matter whether I believe the Judiciary is excellent - I do - but we have an independent Judiciary in this State.It is a Judiciary which many would argue is the organ of Government that has best served the State since its foundation, and to which one can have recourse in the event of one's rights being interfered with or trammelled. This Bill actually fetters the ability of the Judiciary to provide oversight. In a way, it simply interferes with its independence. The Minister will provide information to the court, which the court will take notice of, the appellant will not know what information has been provided to the court, the court may not provide that to the appellant, and yet the process goes on. That is anathema to how the courts have functioned in Ireland up to now. Even in the Special Criminal Court, the operation of which many would question, nothing like this has ever been envisaged. It was discussed, albeit in an entirely different context. The idea of whether the courts would have recourse to or take notice of information that was not provided to an appellant was discussed in the context of a refusal of citizenship on national security grounds. It was found that there was no possibility of that and that it would be a departure for the Irish courts to do that. That is what is proposed in this Bill. For the Minister of State to suggest that there is some kind of independent appeal process which makes it all fine is simply wrong.

Deputy McNamara has been a practitioner in the courts and knows more about them than I do. I would not be as loud in my praise for the Judiciary as he is. That is his entitlement. The Minister of State said that we will have recourse to the courts. Justice delayed is justice denied. There are queues out the door in the courts, as the Minister of State is aware. There are huge backlogs and delays in getting cases heard. I do not know if this is going to work. Where is the transparency? Deputy McNamara said that the Special Criminal Court sits behind closed doors. There is a behind-closed-doors element of this legislation because we, as legislators, are voting for a pig in a poke. We do not know exactly what the process will be other than there will be recourse to the courts. There is talk of this European tool box. It must be a mighty tool box. Like other colleagues, in the last few months in particular, I have heard regularly that we have a full tool box at our disposal to use whatever tools in it that we think desirable for reliefs for our hard-pressed people, but we have not used them or even opened the box. Now, apparently we have the padlock unlocked and it is wide open. The tool box is there to be used and explored and taken advantage of. It may be that there are very well-to-do companies that can afford to go to court. The cost for most companies of going down the road of judicial appeals and reviews is prohibitive. It is very vague to say that there will be recourse to the courts. What courts will they be? Will they be appeal courts or high courts? Will cases end up in the Supreme Court or the European Court of Justice if we are dealing with European companies? Why have something so loose and vague? It is very important that we get this right. As Teachtaí Dála we have to know what we are voting for here.

Consultation on what constitutes a critical component will include detailed consultation with the industry. There are provisions for the Minister to consult with any person the Minister considers appropriate in assessing the risk profile of a vendor. That would likely, in the vast majority of cases, include vendors. Section 23 provides for the Minister to consult with providers and vendors before making any high-risk vendor designations or measures. I think Deputy McNamara's feeling is that this is not independent judicial oversight and that the process is unfair. It is a judge who makes the decision over whether the designation is proportionate. It is a judge who decides what evidence should be shown to the appellant and whether it constitutes material that could pose a risk to national security. That is a decision for the judge and the independent Judiciary. It is out of the hands of the political system. I feel that it is independent. Those decisions are made on the basis of intelligence material that is supplied by the Minister to the judge. We have two intelligence agencies in the State and that is what they work on. I think have covered the points raised by Deputy McGrath with other Deputies, unless there is some specific point that he thinks I did not answer.

Let us say a decision is made. It is about engaging with the alternative supplier and then with the companies, ensuring the supply chain is there and enough time is allowed so that we do not end up in a ridiculous situation where we take out components and we cannot make phone calls.

It would be a very extreme case where we would ask somebody to remove something that is already there.

Basically, this amendment seeks to insert the phrase "by order" in page 21, line 11. Section 20(1) states that, "The Minister may prescribe any component or any class of components as a critical component or critical components." I suppose it is unusual in that it is not clear at all how the Minister will do this. It would seem that an order should set that out. I do not think that order necessarily has issues of national security in it. It is more of a technological determination, but I think it ought to be open to challenge in the normal way that any order is open to challenge. It is only when it affects a particular company that the extremely restrictive measures the Minister has set out by way of the appeal of high-risk vendor measures. Saying that certain components or any class of components are a critical component is a technological determination that should be based on objective criteria and challengeable. Even if I do not accept the whole national security thing, it is a simple technological determination that should be made transparently, and should be challengeable in a transparent way. I am not expecting that it would be challenged particularly. I do not see why making an order doing this, in the same way that the Minister-----

It does not delete anything, as was the case with the previous amendment. It merely sets out a process to be followed in making a determination that a component is a critical component, or a class of components are critical components, and requires that the Minister would publish the proposed component or class of components and give reasons for prescribing it or them as critical. It also calls on the Minister to specify a period during which submissions relating to the proposal may be made. In the event there is urgency involved, the Minister can override that. The new subsection (4) that I have proposed states:The consultation process provided for in subsection (3) may be dispensed with where the Minister certifies that exceptional circumstances justified by urgent considerations of national security so require.”. There is an opt-out for the Minister in that new subsection. I do not think that every order determining that something is a critical component will, or could possibly, involve national security. I am asking the Minister to put in place a process so that not everything comes down to the length of the Lord Chancellor's foot or the views of the Minister or his officials on particular components.

It is about a process. We can get into components and how critical or not they are. Stakeholders who work in the field would consider every component critical in the sense that without it, the system would not work. The Minister of State has made his arguments about why determinations would be made. We need a greater level of clarity in respect of how the process will work and how many people would get a chance or opportunity of eyes-on. I accept what the Minister of State said about a judge making the final decision. I would like to think that a sufficient amount of consultation and due diligence would be carried out. I appreciate the Minister of State's description of this as a matter of future-proofing. That means, however, that a serious conversation must be had across Europe to ensure there is capacity among vendors who are not high risk to be able to deliver in a situation where people cannot access the supply chains they used previously. We need an answer on that point. In fairness to Deputy McNamara - and the Minister of State can answer this point - he is seeking to ensure we have a process in play that provides accountability and includes a proper checklist system to allow us ensure that all the due diligence is carried out as necessary. That applies in respect of the making of these determinations. I would also like some detail as to how much conversation is happening at a wider, international level. If a decision is made in respect of future-proofing, are conversations happening about how delivery could be secured without any logistical hiccups when a project or new piece of infrastructure cannot be put in place because the relevant providers are waiting for a part that a company cannot deliver?

The discussion we are having around this amendment relates to when we are selecting which are critical components, which are the most vulnerable parts of our communications network, which are the weakest parts and which would it be most devastating were they to be attacked. We are considering whether to list those administratively or by order, that is, via a statutory instrument or executive order that would publicly list what those components are. Do we want to publish a list of the most vulnerable, weakest and most attackable parts of our communications network in an open way or not? We have a balance to strike between national security and transparency. There must be consultation on this point. We cannot have a situation whereby the Minister or civil servants write this list. The consultation on this issue is happening in great detail with the industry at the moment. It will continue and reach a rational conclusion. The critical components and most vulnerable parts of the network will be listed. That is why I am proposing that we use an administrative listing.

If we want people to avoid the use of certain components, and the Minister of State has indicated to me that is the purpose of the exercise, but we do not tell companies or persons what components we want them to avoid using, it is entirely counter-productive. It is like saying we are going to proscribe certain substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act because we think it is objectively dangerous for people to take them but not telling people what those drugs are because then they would know what is dangerous. I fundamentally do not understand the logic. I see the Minister of State wants to come back in. I am happy to allow him to do so. I trust I will be able to respond.

Nobody wants to display our weak points and ask that no one kicks us there. I understand that point as it applies to infrastructure. However, Deputy McNamara made his point in a straight manner. The idea is that there are components that are not to be used. We are talking about a situation where a blanket ban could be applied in respect of components across the board. Definitions of what is critical and what is not could result in a very funny conversation at some point in time. We all have a notion about the companies that could possibly be named as high-risk vendors. I am told that many parts made by a particular company are not necessarily in the core of the network infrastructure. Has there been any element of an audit arriving through consultation with communication infrastructure companies? Do we have detail on that point? Deputy McNamara is not proposing a process over which the Minister of State can stand. However, there needs to be a process. We need to put something in place whereby we make the determination from a technical point of view as to what is critical. Beyond that, we also need a process for when we make a determination as regards national security. There needs to be some element of oversight. I accept that the Government might not necessarily wish to put everything in the public domain but there will be a need for some element of accountability and due diligence across the board. Has there been some element of an audit of the infrastructure as it exists at the moment? I accept the Minister of State has said much of this is about future-proofing.

He suggested that we should know which are the critical components that need to be excluded because they are dangerous and should not be in the network. I want to clarify this point and give the Deputy an explanatory memorandum. A number of things are happening here. The first is the designation of critical components. These are parts of the network which are critical to its function. They are not vendor-specific. We might say, for example, that a wireless tower is a critical component or that the cable that connects the wireless tower to another base station is a critical component. We would not want to remove those items from the network. There is then another part of the legislation which refers to security measures that we might take. There are two kinds of listing going on.One is listing the vulnerable or risky parts of the network. The second part is saying the security measures we want to take. The security measure taken does not have to be the banning of a particular vendor and all its equipment from all areas of the communication network. It is much more likely that equipment from a particular vendor used in a particular way should not be used in a particular component of the network. It is a much narrower thing. It can be something for the future. It can be that when replacing the equipment, something else is to be put in. It can be that something is used in a particular way, such as that it has to be firewalled or configured in a certain way to make it safer. The idea is that measures would be released. To respond to Deputy Ó Murchú, a number of vendors in the EU provide a lot of communications network equipment and there is a desire by the EU that vendors and countries diversify and a sense they will be stronger by having a diversified set of equipment. It does not have to be from either of the two major vendors. All countries are keen to promote open RAN and to see that type of open standard and equipment that is less bound to a brand or vendor used throughout.

I do not say the Minister should list the components by order and specify the security measures he requires to be undertaken to make sure they operate safely. That would be a bridge too far because it would enable people to use them in an unsafe way and to figure out readily from looking at the latest ministerial order how to circumvent the requirements. I refer to the components themselves, as opposed to the additional security measures required. Section 20(1) reads, “The Minister may prescribe any component or any class of components as a critical component or critical components.” It subsequently refers to things he can “have regard to”. I have no problem with that but it has to be set out objectively and have a process in place to set it out. I do not see any security implications in it. I see only a requirement of transparency so the Minister cannot act capriciously. Notwithstanding the manner in which these provisions were introduced to the House, I do not think the Minister would act capriciously. However, we do not legislate for the current Minister alone but for future Ministers too.

I introduced amendment No. 26 following concerns on Committee Stage about transparency. It will require the Minister to specify, in the high-risk vendor notice, that he or she considers it necessary to take the measures contained in the order to control risks to the security of electronic communications networks or electronic communications services that may affect national security, and if he or she considers that prior consultation could affect national security, to specify the reasons for this. Amendment No. 27, in the name of Deputy McNamara, will not be necessary because of amendment No. 26, which is intended to serve the purpose, whereby the Minister will have to specify in the high-risk vendor notice that he or she considers it necessary to take the measures contained in the order to control risks to the security of electronic communications networks or electronic communications services that may affect national security, and where the Minister considers consultation would be contrary to the interests of national security, to specify the reasons this is so. Neither will I accept amendment No. 28, because there will be occasions when it will be necessary, in the interests of national security, for a provider to which a high-risk vendor notice applies to maintain the existence or contents of the order as confidential whereby disclosure of the order could be contrary to the interests of national security. The importance of section 26 is underpinned by subsection (2), which sets out criminal sanctions for a provider found guilty of failing to comply with this requirement. I will not accept amendment No. 29 because it is often the case it is not possible for myriad reasons to consult a vendor, including where the vendor is based in another jurisdiction, which may complicate contacting the vendor. The components could be open source components where it is not clear who the natural person or body corporate making the components are, or the vendor could simply no longer exist and, therefore, it would be disproportionate to remove the safeguard of "make reasonable efforts to", leading to the imposition of an administrative burden to have this requirement in place, preventing the Minister from taking the required measures.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-25 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	324	I welcome the fact the Minister of State intends to remove from the section the reference to "public order", which is a step forward, and every step forward, no matter how small, is to be welcomed. Regarding amendment No. 29, I do not accept the Minister of State’s reasoning. If the vendor is based outside the jurisdiction, it can still be contacted, and if it does not reply in time, that is the problem of the vendor, perhaps because it is precluded by distance and is selling something far away. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact the Minister of State is seeking to remove the reference to "public order" in line 22 of page 24 such that the provision will be limited to national security. It is difficult to envisage circumstances where this matter would arise, although perhaps banning a Huawei component could lead to riots on the streets. I do not know. Deputy Ó Murchú rightly made the point it is all well and good to label something as a high-risk component, but are we going to be able to replace a component that comes from the good guys? It seems this Bill is about good guys and bad guys, and we all have preconceived notions about who is who in that regard. That is my concern. National security apparatuses certainly work under the idea that there are good guys and bad guys and that there are states the information from which we receive is solid and reliable, along with their military hardware – I suppose we are moving in that direction generally - and other states whose information is not solid or reliable. Our officials travel to conferences in the capital cities of some of those states and meet their counterpart employees of the security apparatuses of those states and, therefore, we think they are the good guys. I am not convinced, however, that there are good guys in the world of international espionage. I do not think any information we receive in regard to national security is going to come from the Phoenix Park. Rather, I think it will come from an embassy in either the Phoenix Park, Ballsbridge or somewhere like that. My concern is that there is so little scrutiny. I accept that the scrutiny of measures taken on the basis of national security is always going to be difficult, but that does not mean there should be no scrutiny, yet I fear that is, effectively, what the Minister of State is introducing. It is a mechanism by which the assertions of other states are going to be taken as read, and nobody will be in a position to say otherwise. I accept that the Chinese are developing this and I have my doubts about them because the Americans told us we should do, but it would be naive to think that only China and Chinese companies are interested in espionage and in compromising the security of networks to their advantage.I would have thought the American security apparatus or the British, French, Russian, Indian or Pakistani security apparatus - name your pick of any big power - would not be doing its job unless it felt it could compromise networks and get the information it needs out of them. The argument the Minister of State is making is that we have the rule of law in some states and the law is at least more robust in some states than in others. We have seen that in action over the past two years where, ironically, people can be brought before the Houses on Capitol Hill and made answer very awkward questions. Indeed, Zuckerberg was brought in and very awkward questions were asked in the House of Commons about some of the information for sale that was gleaned from Facebook and how that came about. While we accept these countries are not likely to be deemed as high-risk vendors because they have a robust rule of law and accountability structure, we are saying we should have no accountability structure whatsoever for these Houses, with no orders to be made, nothing to be set out and no way to challenge anything. We are saying it would be dangerous for us to even know what is being done because it would fry our little minds and we should leave it to the House. We trust the elected representatives of the American and British people to hold to account companies operating in their jurisdictions and make sure they are safe, we are going to just rely, carte blanche, on what they tell us. That is a fundamental problem I have with this Bill. It is one I have articulated previously to little avail, although at least the reference to "public order" has been taken out. Sometimes in this place, one stands over the very small successes.

We are back to the need for a process. I accept that all states will make determinations on the basis of national security. There needs to be some element of oversight - we can call it accountability - and making sure there are eyes on, that due diligence is done and we do not necessarily accept without question the intelligence from certain quarters. It is fair to say all major states even spy on their friends from time to time. None of us is naive enough to think there are absolutely good guys and absolutely bad guys. There are an awful lot of people who are involved in this particular game. We need to do the work to ensure there is going to be the throughput - the supply chain - of material that can do the business from a technological point of view. I am not going to keep repeating these points but it comes back to that point of the process.

I thank Deputy McNamara for acknowledging that we have moved some distance towards trying to find a compromise on the worthwhile suggestions he made. We spent time trying to amend the legislation in order to go some distance towards his position. We do not feel we can guarantee that we can reach a vendor to consult with it but we will make the best effort we can. That is really what the legislation is trying to say. We know we can consult the mobile operators. We know we will regulate licensed operators in the Irish telecommunications sector because we know where they are and we can call around to discuss something. However, we cannot guarantee we will be able to consult a firm on the other side of the world that may have gone out of business or is not responding to us. That is what this amendment is about. I neglected to say I will also move amendments Nos. 33 and 36.

I have reservations about the fact that the high-risk vendor notice has to remain confidential because it is going to be very strange if a certain component just disappears from the network. It seems almost sinister where it is a bit like those photographs where people just start disappearing from them, and nobody knows why. I do not want it to appear that I am reading something sinister into everything but surely in the commercial world in which one supplies an essential component, and it is determined by the Minister that it is from a high-risk vendor so, it then has to be removed and one then can no longer, presumably, provide a service as a result of that, albeit on a temporary or permanent basis, or a product cannot be provided on a temporary basis while one sources an alternative component.  As I understand it, this high-risk vendor notice comes into immediate effect and one cannot say that a high-risk vendor notice is going to come into effect some time in the future. If that is the case, if Eir, for example, and I do not wish to discuss any company that is provides communication networks, cannot fulfil its contractual obligations because a Minister has determined that it has obtained components from a high-risk vendor that the previous day were perfectly lawful and the company had done nothing wrong, but today the company must remove those components, surely the company should be in a position to offer a rational explanation for its failure to fulfil its contractual obligations.

I am not accepting amendment No. 42 as I believe that this is a disproportionate and unworkable step. Judicial independence is at the core of the proper judicial role in any free society and, on appointment, judges make a solemn declaration in a manner required by the Constitution that they will adjudicate impartially without fear or favour.

I do not understand the Minister's idea that this interferes with judicial independence. It merely states that if somebody challenges the making of a high-risk vendor notice, the Minister can go to court and provide it with all of the reasons he or she determines that the high-risk vendor notice is appropriate, much of which I anticipate will be based on national security grounds.The judge then looks at it and determines what it is appropriate to give to the appellant, that is, the person who is challenging the notice. The appellant will be given some information or, indeed, all of the evidence that the Minister has put forward or, perhaps, none of it. There is a proposal in the Bill whereby the appellant can be given a summary of the information provided. This amendment proposes that if a judge determines that some, but not all, of the information be given to the appellant, once that determination is made the judge will not go on to hear the substantive case. The idea that a judge will be able to act appropriately etc. is something with which I have no problem. The idea that a judge will be given information by the Minister in respect of the appellant, but the appellant will not have access to that information and may not even know what the information is about, depending on what the judge deems appropriate to give to the appellant, is a new departure. It is something that exists in other jurisdictions, not in this context but in regards to terrorism charges or allegations of terrorist activity. There are special advocate procedures in place in the United Kingdom. On the Continent it is not unusual to have such a system. However, in the Irish system the judge is there to look at the information and all of the evidence. Both parties can challenge all of the evidence against them. That is the normal course. There is no facet of Irish law where that is not the case. There is no facet of Irish law where an appellant or a party to proceedings cannot challenge all of the assertions made against them and all of the evidence which supports such assertions. In the Special Criminal Court there is an issue around a superintendent's assertion that somebody is a member of a prescribed organisation. The Chief Justice found that it would be unconstitutional if that was not required to be corroborated. In this instance there is no protection whatsoever. In the case of an appellant who goes to court, the Minister can state he or she has information from an embassy or security apparatus. Of course, the Minister will always say that there is a threat to national security to divulge the very fact that he or she is obtaining information from the Americans, British, French, Germans, Latvians or Lithuanians – take your pick. The exchange of that information is contingent upon it being confidential. A Minister can argue that merely saying that information has been obtained from whatever security state will threaten our national security. Of course there will be an application that the information not be provided to the appellant. The judge may deem it appropriate to provide some, but not other, information. For the judge to then determine the case against an appellant based on evidence that the judge and Minister have, but which the appellant has never been provided with, is, as I have said, a novel departure in Irish law and one that I am not in any way comfortable with. I am not comfortable with the process in any event, but my amendment could at least ensure that it essentially involves a different court. One way or the other, it will involve the High Court. A different judge of the High Court than the judge who would determine what information would be provided to the appellant would hear the case.  Of course, the amendment has the further effect that only the evidence provided to the appellant can be used in the appeal of the making of the high-risk vendor notice. Up to now, in all or any courts in Ireland both parties have had equal access to all of the evidence that a judge hears. That has not been controversial up to now. This is a Rubicon. It is a new departure, and one that I do not think is necessitated. It is not proportionate to introduce it at this time and in this context. It is a concept that should not be introduced without a lot of debate. As I said, if the Minister can provide any context in Irish law where something like this occurs, I would welcome hearing about it. I am not aware of any such cases. I understand it was discussed in a case called AP in court. I have no idea what the previous Chief Justice and Mr. Justice O'Donnell, who is now the Chief Justice, would find with regard to this, but it was clear from their judgments that this would be a new departure. Given that it is a new departure, it is something that needs to be very fully debated.

I feel this is an interference in judicial independence. The courts can determine which judge hears which hearing. That is a question for the courts, rather than the Minister, to determine. There are alternative ways of dealing with the designation of vendors or specification of security measures. They could be done by writing the law in such a way that the Minister could simply issue the list on consultation with the security services, which is how it is done in other countries. We decided to introduce judicial oversight to make sure that it was taken out of the hands of the political system and handed over to the Judiciary so that it could make a decision. It will look at it independently, separate from any political party or holder of ministerial office, and make its determination. Of course, intelligence information which is a risk to national security cannot be supplied to the appellant or written about in open court where it would cause a risk to the country. In fact, it would frustrate the entire purpose of the Bill, which is to protect the national security of the country. That is why we have tried, as far as possible, to separate the political system from the judicial system and make this an independent judicial decision, rather than a political one. We propose to provide as much information to the courts as possible and advise judges that they provide as much information as can safely be provided to the appellant without endangering national security. It is a fair balance.

That is not the way our legal system has operated up to now. Essentially, the Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions or whoever is prosecuting a case has a determination to make. They have evidence and have two choices. If they want to use the evidence against an accused, they have to do so in open court and the defendant has to have access to it. That is how the administration of justice works in Ireland. If they are not prepared to do that, they simply cannot rely on that evidence as part of proceedings. They will have to have to seek to convict using other evidence. This, of course, is not the status quo. It is not the way our justice system operates at the moment. In fact, it is the contrary. That is why this is a very new departure. Information can be used which is not provided to the other party. Nowhere else has this been done in Irish law up to now. It is something that needs an awful lot more debate. The Minister of State thinks it is entirely self-evident that information cannot be used against somebody. However, under the Irish justice system at the moment the accused is of course provided with all of the evidence that will be used against him or her in court by way of disclosure. We have a choice about whether we use that evidence, with the difficulties that entails. There are two "of courses" and the Minister of State seems to think this proposal is perfectly rational. His position is not one that is out of kilter with other European states, but it is out of kilter with the administration of justice in Ireland. I am not happy for that Rubicon to be crossed without a vote.Will each section be included in the Bill? Once we get to the end of the amendments, is that it? Do we then vote on the Bill or do we go through it section by section? Will the Acting Chairman ask that section 1 stand part of the Bill, section 2 and so forth?

If an individual is accused of a crime in Ireland, he or she would like to see the evidence against him or her but nobody is being accused here. This is about the designation of a vendor's equipment as being high risk in a particular section of the Irish communications network. It is a designation. It does not refer to a natural individual. Nobody is being charged with a criminal offence. We are talking about a foreign corporate entity and we have defined in the legislation that it has to be a corporate entity outside of the EU. We are not talking about a person whose rights are being infringed and drawing such a parallel is unfair. We have to protect our national security. There is a war going on in Europe at the moment. That is what has spurred this legislation, to be absolutely clear. Countries are being attacked and we are providing safe harbour to tens of thousands of people who are refugees from war, who others are attempting to murder. If we find that a country which is in an offensive stance vis-à-vis our country has equipment here which is provided by an untrusted part of that administration, then of course we have to remove it and we have to have the legal power to do so. We do not want to do it without having a legal basis and that is what this legislation is about. Its aim is to protect national security. There has to be a balance here.

In respect of amendment No. 44, as a result of the constructive feedback that I received on Committee Stage, I have already introduced an amendment to section 27 that provides that if the High Court is satisfied on an application by the Minister that the hearing of an appeal of a high-risk vendor measure or a variation in such measure is likely to result in the disclosure of relevant material and that such disclosure would create a risk to the security of the State, it should exclude from the hearing of the appeal all persons except the persons outlined in section 27.

ComReg may, if required, serve a direction on the provider seeking further information or requiring it to submit to a security audit. These directions are applicable immediately on service, or in other cases, at the expiration of a period allowed for to make representations. Failure to comply with a direction from ComReg under this section is an offence.  In respect of amendment No. 47, on Committee Stage there was a request from the Chair that there should be a provision for a review of this part of the Bill after two years and I said I would consider bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage. I am introducing this amendment, as requested on Committee Stage, to allow a review of the operation of Part 3 of the Bill on high-risk vendors which will commence two years after the enactment of the Bill. The report will be made to both Houses of the Oireachtas within a year after the beginning of the review and will set out its findings and conclusions.

These amendments were flagged on Committee Stage and they refer to alternative dispute resolution procedures. These amendments amend sections 38 to 40, inclusive, of the Bill. The intention of these amendments is to broaden the definition of relevant dispute under section 38 to ensure that Article 25 of the code is adequately transposed, to preserve existing provisions and to make some further amendments to section 39 and 40 of the Bill that are consequential to the amendment to section 38. As originally drafted, section 38 did not fully reflect Article 25 of the code as it restricted the type of disputes under the code that could be referred to the dispute resolution process to disputes under Articles 102 to 107, inclusive, and 115, whereas Article 25 of the directive determines that the dispute resolution process should be applicable to disputes between providers and consumers arising under the directive and relating to the performance of contracts more generally. It also reduced the scope of the dispute resolution process such that some disputes that could be resolved under regulation No. 27 of the universal service regulations, SI 337/2011, would not now be able to be resolved under Part 5 of the Bill. Under the 2011 regime, ComReg currently resolves disputes in relation to section 45 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 regarding overcharging and to Part 3 and Part 4 of such regulations 21 and 22, and Part 5 of the EU consumer information, cancellation and other rights regulations of 2013. These amendments will ensure that ComReg continues to be able to resolve these other categories of disputes.
