#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1	There are two proposals to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9 agreed to?
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	2	My party will not agree, as there is no motion to reconvene the Dáil on Monday to allow time to discuss the detail and serious implications of what is being put to the people.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I am surprised the Deputy does not want it to take place on Sunday.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Please, Deputy.  This is a straightforward proposal on the arrangements for taking No. 9 solely.  We cannot stray into other areas.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	6	We are objecting.  I am genuinely shocked that there is nothing on the page——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Will the Deputy, please, resume his seat?
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	8	How can the Government have it said in Europe that the people have agreed to a set of proposals that gave away our sovereignty, when there has not even been a discussion on these measures in the House?  It is outrageous.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The Deputy should resume his seat.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Prime Minister Cameron is on Deputy Mac Lochlainn's side.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I am surprised Deputy McDonald is not doing the running on this proposal.

#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	13	But not on the measures as they affect the people.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	14	In addition, a new procedure saw the Taoiseach attend the House last week to set out what was to be discussed by the European Council.  We have made arrangements for him to revert to the House when it reconvenes next week to give a report on what was discussed at the European summit.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Is the proposal for dealing with No. a4 agreed to?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Not agreed.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	18	We cannot discuss the contents of the Bill.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	19	It sets the context.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	20	There are issues with family income supplement, disability allowances and community employment schemes.  No doubt the Government will be told that, for some arbitrary reason, the Dáil must pass the Bill today.  It will affect people's lives next year.  Some will lose hundreds of euro thanks to the decisions that will be rammed through the House today.  I received an e-mail from a woman this morning——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	21	We will not mind e-mails for the moment.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	22	We will hear about it at our clinics tomorrow.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	23	We can hear about the e-mail when we debate the Bill, but I am sure it has nothing to do with the arrangements for the taking of Second and Subsequent Stages.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	24	It is about the arrangements.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	25	It is about the manner in which the Bill is being rammed through the House.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Will Deputy Ó Cuív stick to the proposal, please?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The e-mail is from a woman who will lose €330 a month because she is a carer and her husband is in receipt of family income supplement.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I am not interested in e-mails other than those which relate to this issue.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	29	From the bottom of my heart, I ask the Tánaiste to put politics aside, allow Second Stage to continue until 3.30 p.m. and a detailed debate to take place next week on the Bill's serious provisions which will hurt people badly.  The Government should give itself time to reflect on and amend some of the proposals made.  Some of the measures proposed will not save significant amounts of money.  It is impossible——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Deputy is only entitled to give a short explanation as to why he is not agreeing to the allocation of time motion.  Other Deputies wish to contribute.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	31	It is like a Second Stage speech.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I am trying to impress on the Tánaiste how vital it is that we all stand back, to reflect on this issue——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	33	We will do that in one moment.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	34	——and debate it in more detail next week having had the weekend to consider it——
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	35	What about the way the Deputy signed the bank bailout by telephone in the middle of the night?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	36	——and make necessary changes to proposals that will only save a small amount of money but which will hurt people badly.  The Tánaiste knows this to be the case, given the reaction to the budget.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I object to the rushed passage of the Bill which will cut the contributory State pension and allowances for lone parents.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	38	We cannot discuss the contents of the Bill.  This is purely a technical motion.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	39	We have not even dealt with the manner in which the Government proposes to devastate community employment schemes across the State.  Job creation, how are you?  I object to the manner in which the Bill is being processed through the House and the indecent haste with which the Government is prepared to butcher €800 million from the social welfare bill.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	40	It is not €800 million; it is €455 million.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	41	It is astonishing that the Labour Party and the Tánaiste as its leader are standing over such cuts.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	42	We can discuss all of these matters during the debate.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	43	That is bad enough, but the Government is also insisting on the Bill being rushed through the Dáil.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	44	What about Northern Ireland?
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Why does Fine Gael not stand for election there, too?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	46	That is a good point.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I call Deputy Higgins to discuss what is a technical issue.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I oppose the guillotining of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.This time last year, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, unveiled his budget, screams of anguish reverberated through the corridors of Leinster House.  The Labour Party's finance spokesman Deputy Burton was feeling the pain of the poor, the lone parents and, especially, the women of Ireland.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	49	A history lesson.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I dare say the Minister must be aware people with children took the biggest cuts this year and last year.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	51	She is not even here.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The Deputy is straying.  We do not want any quotations from last year.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Let us remember child benefit is paid almost universally to women.  I suppose that is a comment on how few women are Members of this House and what little power women exercise compared to bankers.This day, in an extraordinary transformation, the same Deputy Burton is now the tormentor of the women and children of Ireland.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	54	This is nothing to do with the technical motion before the House.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I wonder is the Minister in Deputy Higgins's constituency.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I ask the Deputy not to abuse this.  I am anxious for him to have his say but not on a technical motion.  He can say all these things when we get into the debate.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The nub of it is that mná na hÉireann and leanaí na hÉireann are bewildered by this massive about-face and need an explanation.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	58	About the fact we are finishing at 3.30 p.m.?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	59	We need, therefore, far more time for Deputy Burton, now Minister for — allegedly — Social Protection, to come into the Dáil and explain the extraordinary transformation and to do so section by section.  She must think that along with her pain, a general anaesthetic should be administered to the same women and children whose state she bewailed last year.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The Deputy has made his point about the lack of time.  He must resume his seat.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Tánaiste, on behalf of the Labour Party, must explain the absolute about-face in regard to these issues.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Yes, when we get to the debate.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	63	A few clinics tomorrow back in the constituencies.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Therefore, we need far more time for the Minister and the Tánaiste on behalf of the Labour Party to explain why now they are carrying out these savage cuts on behalf of the same bankers.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Deputy is looking for time and I will ask the Tánaiste about that in a moment.  I am sure when I call Deputy Boyd Barrett that he will understand what he is entitled to say.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The Ceann Comhairle knows I understand.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	67	It is a Friday so give us all a break.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	68	This is a serious issue and the Tánaiste knows it.  People are reeling with shock; lone parents, low income families and the elderly are reeling from the attacks meted out in this Bill.  The very least they deserve is that the full implications of the attacks on their living standings are explained, particularly the Government's commitment to labour activation measures designed to get people back to work, when it is absolutely clear that, particularly for lone parents, these measures are a direct disincentive to work.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	69	We can discuss that when we get to the section.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	70	They will drive lone parents out of work and back into poverty.These serious implications deserve to be discussed in detail and not rammed through in this way by a Government that promised a new type of politics and a new type of openness and transparency.  These austerity measures are being rammed through in an unfair and undemocratic way.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	71	The Deputy has made his point.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	72	There will be 1,000 people outside the gates of Dáil Éireann appealing for a proper debate and a reversal of these cuts.  Will the Tánaiste at least allow for a proper discussion?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The Deputy has made his point.  He can resume his seat and we will ask the Tánaiste to explain the arrangements.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	74	It will take some explaining.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Government is providing more time for the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  There is 50% more time being provided for the debate on the Social Welfare Bill this year than was provided last year.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Deputies cannot come in here today and argue for more time when yesterday they voted against the extra day's sitting the Government is providing for this Bill, today's sitting.  This is the extra day's sitting.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	79	What is the Tánaiste on?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	80	That is nonsense.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	81	A huge amount of time is being provided for the debate.  The Bill will go to the Seanad next week and if the Seanad makes amendments, it will come back into the Dáil and there is plenty of time.  I ask Members for accuracy in the debate.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	84	In a full year it is.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	85	In fact, it is €190 million less than was proposed by Fianna Fáil.

#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I am in no doubt but that many people believed in the Labour Party before last February's general election.  At that time, the Labour Party had a message of hope regarding an alternative.  It would be Labour's way or Frankfurt's way.  The party of Connolly would protect the interests of workers and the marginalised.  However, one should roll on the clock some months.  The electorate rewarded the Labour Party for its efforts with the place in government its members so desperately craved.  Unfortunately for all those who believed in the message of the Labour Party, the change in Government did not herald a change in policy, politics, strategy or direction.  If one ever needed proof, it is contained in this Bill.  While the new Government spent its time publicly criticising its predecessors for landing it in this mess, it privately agreed with its approach.  Group-think landed us in this position and while Fine Gael and the Labour Party believe group-think will get us out of it, it is obvious it will not.  The Government's blueprint for recovery predicts, in some sort of ironic joke, that in 2015, after four years of crippling austerity and emigration, at least 382,000 people still will be unemployed.  The Government acknowledges this but carries on regardless.  It acknowledges this but refuses to recognise that alternatives exist or at least it refuses to entertain them.This Social Welfare Bill will be part of the guarantee that will realise this prediction.  That the Labour Party in government — a Labour Minister to boot — could deliver such a Social Welfare Bill in the context of a budget that protected the well-off literally is unbelievable.  In this budget, lone parents, the disabled, children, widows and the elderly and vulnerable were perceived as fair game.  The effect of the Social Welfare Bill will further cement inequality in Ireland.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael have conspired in coalition to deliver a budget that will result in a family in receipt of social welfare benefits and with three children losing more than its equivalent who earns €150,000 per annum, that is, a loss of €1,078 versus €1,050.  The Bill under discussion gives effect to much of that difference.Moreover, the position is not much better for households that are at risk of poverty, one quarter of which are headed by someone who is in some form of employment.  A household with three children will lose €228 in 2012 in respect of child benefit alone and an additional €96 from 2013.  If a family has four or more children, the loss will be €288 for the third child and €204 for each additional child in 2012, with further cuts scheduled for 2013.  This money to a family on the margin literally could mean the difference between heat and cold, food and hunger and, heaven forbid, life and death.  For those families reliant on the State for support, this Social Welfare Bill may well pull them under the water.  Those who voted for change last February have been sorely let down.  This Bill will have a devastating effect on the lives of ordinary people who now, more than ever, need Members of the House to stand up for them.  I appeal to all Members to oppose the Bill, as choices and alternatives exist.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I thank Deputies McLellan and Ó Snodaigh for facilitating this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I believe in the Labour Party and I stand proudly and unapologetically in this Chamber on behalf of the people of Dublin West, who sent me here to represent their interests and to stand up for Labour values.  These values have never been articulated better than in the impassioned speeches given last night by my colleagues, Deputies Eric Byrne and Dowds, on community employment schemes and elements of this Bill.  Unfortunately, unless dramatic changes are made to this legislation, I will not be able to support the Bill because I believe it contravenes some of the core objectives this country must achieve to get people back to work and to achieve equality and social justice in our society.  I acknowledge the Minister shares my commitment to this objective although we may disagree on how to vote on the Bill.I wish to raise the issue of community employment schemes, which provide a vital resource to people who seek to get back into the labour market and to make a contribution to their communities.  This morning, I visited the Blanchardstown Centre for the Unemployed, where many people are employed on community employment schemes and make an outstanding contribution to that community.  The decision to cut the materials grants by €1,000 is  wrong and will not work.  This afternoon, I will be proud to march with those community employment scheme workers, not just from my own constituency but from across the city and beyond, who make a vital contribution and who deserve to have reinstated this grant.In addition, I welcome the decision to review cuts to the disability allowance.  However, the fact it is possible to review and reconsider that payment, which is positive, begs the question as to the reason it was ever included in the provisions.  This demonstrates that as a country, we have choices.  All of us, as public representatives but more importantly as citizens, can come together, meet our international obligations and deal with the deficit and the debts imposed on us by the disastrous policies of the banking sector, developers and Fianna Fáil but in a way that is fair, that asks those who have most to pay most and that asks that consideration be given to a wealth tax.  I note that in response to a parliamentary question tabled in this House a few months ago, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated such a tax would generate €500 million.  These issues must be put on the table.In the time available to me, I also wish to raise the issue of mortgage interest supplements.  The decision to increase the contribution for households for mortgage interest supplements makes it even more difficult for hard-pressed households already in arrears to meet such payments.  It seems illogical to extend to 12 months the period from which one must be eligible for mortgage interest supplement because in the fields of health policy, education and social security, early intervention is the solution.  Early intervention provides value for money for the taxpayer and I ask that this provision also be reviewed.The Bill also contained a decision to review and provide new regulations for the exceptional needs payments next year.  I worked for many years for a housing and homeless organisation and the exceptional needs payment comprises once-off payments that often are provided to people emerging, for example, from homeless services to acquire their appliances or the tools that Members would take for granted when moving into a new home.  As for what these regulations should contain, I hope the review will ensure the expansion of these payments, the facilitation of people moving out of homelessness and that the process will not be made more difficult.It emerged today that the decision to make the carer's allowance subject to income assessment for those in receipt of family income supplement will hit 300 families, all of which are saving the State thousands of euro by caring for a loved one, a friend or a partner.  That decision must be reviewed.There are elements of the Bill that will hit those who have least the hardest.  We must ask ourselves whether we can stand over these measures, if there a better way to deal with our problems as a country and these measures will assist people back into education and training or make matters more difficult.  They will make them more difficult.  Some 20% of the population is at risk of poverty and these elements of the Bill will make life more difficult for them.  However, the facts remains that the Government parties could make different choices.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Labour Party to build an alternative, but I will not support the Bill unless changes are made.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	132	As the Deputy said, there are choices to be made.  I am very conscious as I make this contribution that at the start of this week a homeless person was found dead on a street in my constituency.  The Deputy is correct in saying that what we need to do is to find a way to ensure we can meet our requirements but in a way that is socially just and protects the vulnerable.  In the coming days what the people think of the budget and their responses to it will become clear.  I was very conscious in the run-up to it of a gigantic fear, particularly among the elderly, that there would be cuts in the benefits to which many hundreds of thousands were entitled and received such as child benefit, the State pension and other core payments.  A feature of the legislation is that most of the core benefits, on which people depend to cope with the effects of poverty, old age and help them bring up their children, have been retained and remain unchanged.  That is the result of the choices made by the Government.Other changes were made, on one of which we touched, in respect of which the Government has made a decision to review, which is welcome.  The changes will have to be studied and we will have to understand what their impact would be.  There is a large number of community enterprise projects in my constituency and I very much understand the valuable work they do.  If we are talking about putting in place every measure we can to ensure people are sustained when they are without a job and will have the ability to find one in the future, it is counter-productive to put in place measures that would undermine the viability of projects.  I do not believe the measures included in the budget, in particular the measure discussed, will have the effect alleged, but the fact that it has been alleged means it is worthy of study.  We must engage with those who have made these points to understand what can be done to mitigate the alleged effect.In terms of the broader choices to be made, this is a theme with which the House will have to engage in the coming years.  We need to debate issues such as the feasibility of introducing a wealth tax, about which I have genuine concern.  I will voice my opposition to it, but that does mean there is not a need to debate the matter and understand the issues involved.  I am concerned about the idea that there is a large amount of additional tax revenue that could be tapped into by increasing income tax, but we should have that debate.  If we do not discuss such issues, we will make the greatest mistake of all in the eyes of the people, that we appear not to care and that we are not actively willing to engage on these choices.  I am genuinely concerned that the possibility of a wealth tax being imposed could cause a huge amount on deposit to be withdrawn from the banking system which, in turn, would increase the risks and costs taxpayers would face.  There are facts there to support this genuinely held view.  In the context of the bigger choices our society has to make, we should find a way inside and outside the Oireachtas to discuss these points and decide what is right and of all the various options, which ones could be taken on board by the Government to ensure vulnerable people are protected amidst all the changes taking place.In considering the Bill many who had experienced ferocious hardship following the last budget feared there would be cuts to many of the core benefits, but there was none.  That is the reason I am supporting the legislation.  However, I take Deputy Nulty's point that many of the measures announced in the budget were greeted with relief, but I accept that feeling was not shared by all.  While I will support the Bill which will be passed, if there are concerns regarding its implementation, the very least we can do is to examine if there other ways of achieving savings to ensure we meet the targets set, while also protecting the most vulnerable in society, which is what we all want to achieve.In listening to Deputy Nulty, I was struck by his sense of social justice.  However, he does not have a monopoly of it.  Nearly everyone involved in political life is in it because he or she is motivated by the idea of achieving social justice through public service.  We may differ strongly on how we want to achieve it, but we have that point in common.  In this Bill we have done all we can to strike a balance between the pressures on the economy and the needs of the people.  For that reason, it is worthy of support.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I am pleased to have the honour to say a few words about this important Bill.  I often had the opportunity when my party was in opposition to speak to the social welfare Bill and relished the opportunity to do so.  However, today is different because I am on the Government side of the House.  We have to be realistic about where the country is at.  In the light of this, I say to the Government: well done for not cutting social benefits, including those for pensioners.  As I travelled across my constituency in recent months I met many people, particularly older people who were fearful that their pensions would be cut.  While they wished the Government the best of luck with the budget, they did not want to see their benefits being cut.  I am pleased to say the Government has not cut their pension benefits.  When I attended a function in my constituency last night, I was amazed at the number of people whom I met who said, "Well done on the budget; you were a fair Government to do what you did."  I was amazed at the response to the budget.While many Members have differing views, we are often removed from what people on the ground think.  The public is very fair.  It understands we are borrowing almost €300 million a week to run the country and that such borrowing is not sustainable into the future.  It does not believe those who say there is another and better way to do it.  There is not and it knows it.  The people will stand behind us while we debate the issues involved and introduce the necessary measures to make the country a fairer place for all.I listened with interest to the contribution of the new Labour Party Deputy.  I would love to have had a word with him before he made some of his decisions.  Like me, he was elected in a by-election.  I was first elected to the House in a by-election in 2001.  Until earlier this year I was on the Opposition benches, standing up making contributions and speeches week in week out.  It is only in recent months that I can say I have been able to participate and do something for the people I represent, because be it right or wrong the structures of the House mean that only those in government can do something for the people.In recent weeks the issues with regard to the budget, such as health, social welfare, agriculture and job creation, were discussed at our parliamentary party meetings and parliamentary party meetings of the Labour Party, which Ministers attended.  Some issues were also discussed on the airwaves.  However, the only people who could have a say were the Government parties.  They are the people who make a difference.To anyone who is privileged to be part of a Government team I say there is no better place to make a difference and impact than to be in government, given the structures we have.  I wish Deputy Nulty well and I hope his career is a good one, but as somebody who served on the Opposition side of the House for many years I will give him a tip: one can talk for hours and do much research but the system we have here, although it is opening up through pre-budget discussions, means we must be on the Government side of the House to have an impact.We have also had a good impact on jobseeker's allowance and benefit which were not touched.  Child benefit for the first two children remains unchanged.  Payments to carers will be maintained and the half-rate carer's allowance will continue to be paid to people who are full-time carers and who receive another welfare benefit.  The annual respite grant of €1,700 will continue and carer's allowance remains unchanged at €204 for those under 66 years of age and €239 for those aged 66 and over.Of course the budget will be tough on many people.  Nobody on this side of the House suggests otherwise, but there are plenty of examples of the positive effort made by the Government to protect some of the more vulnerable in society.  We saw many examples of the implementation of unnecessarily harsh cuts by the previous Government impacting on pensioners.  We all remember the pensioners who attacked John Moloney at a meeting.

If we were living in different economic times and our country was better off one could have left the grant as it was, but we are not.  Nothing was mentioned about any of the schemes because they have made major contributions in many parishes, towns and villages throughout the country.  I suggest that if it were possible I have no doubt the Government would leave the grant untouched, but it cannot do so.  I call on the Minister to put in place a mechanism whereby schemes which demand more goods, cement or materials than others can make a special case and that a window of opportunity be put in place for them.

#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I have serious concerns about farm assistance.  I want to raise an issue that is before the Department of Social Protection at present, which is that of self-employed people who have found themselves without work in recent years but are not entitled to social welfare.  A case was taken in the United Kingdom in this regard.  I think the United Kingdom and Ireland are the only two countries with S and A class contributions.  I understand a case has been taken through the UK system which is being examined by the Attorney General here.  One case concerns a small company, of which a husband and wife are directors and sole traders.  The contribution charged on their accounts is incorrect.  It was put down as an S class contribution.  My understanding is that the advice given to the Department is that it should have been an A class contribution.  I also understand the Department and the Minister have been advised on this issue.This is a serious matter across the country and it has huge implications.  Every practising politician in this House, at whatever level, has come across people who have gone to the local social welfare office and found that, because their business has ceased trading, they have no entitlements.  I ask the Minister of State to take this matter back to the Minister for consideration.  In her reply to the debate, or on Report and Final Stages, the Minister might clarify this issue which concerns the self-employed.  As I said, my understanding is that Ireland and the United Kingdom are the only two countries in the western world that are out of sync on this matter.  I believe, however, the position has been rectified in the United Kingdom.  There is also an implication that the company directors should have paid PRSI, the S class contribution, and employer's and employee's contributions would also have to be paid.  This is a serious issue which needs to be clarified because it affects these vulnerable individuals.I do not intend to trade comments across the floor of the House on the Social Welfare Bill, but a number of people have been badly served by it.  This is particularly so with regard to family income supplement and the carer's allowance disregard.  We have had a discussion this morning on carer's allowance, which I acknowledge has been greatly increased in recent years.  There was always a sense at Government level that carers should be further looked after.  When the allowance started, it was from a very low base.  Carer's benefit was introduced later, in 2001-02, for a period of two years to allow persons to take time off, and a large number of people have benefited from it.  Anything concerning the carer's allowance disregard should be re-examined because it only a small number of people are affected.  Government speakers have said the rates have been maintained, but the Government has also sneaked in individual cuts or individual schemes have been removed.Many groups and participants in community employment schemes have contacted me in recent days.  They are saying that while the number of participants in community employment schemes has not decreased, the reduction in the capital allocation will effectively result in many such schemes being closed; thus, those operating schemes will face huge difficulties in maintaining them.  Community employment schemes have brought major benefits to both urban and rural communities; therefore, the budget cuts represent a retrograde step.  The money hitherto spent on schemes went straight back into the local economy as facilities and materials were provided.  By and large, such items were purchased in the local community.  In effect, another source of income for local communities is being removed.There is a lot in the budget that is anti-rural.  Various schemes have been established in recent years to maintain services in rural Ireland.  A critical analysis of where we are must include an examination of the negative effects of the drive to centralise everything in urban areas.  It has happened here, in the United States and elsewhere, but it has proved very costly for the State.  People who live and work in rural Ireland are not a great drain on State services, including transport, because they provide their own services.  Social planners and departmental decision-makers have been working constantly on this issue, as have groups such as An Taisce, yet the policy has failed across the world.  The budget provisions will affect rural schools, local improvement and group water schemes which have made a great difference.  Rural Ireland is being targeted yet again because of the cutbacks in such schemes which provide ten times the value offered by similar schemes in urban areas.Having made these points, I would be grateful to receive clarification from the Department on the question of S and A class contributions for small companies.

No more than myself on the other side of the county border, he has always worked for the less well-off in society.  I am incredibly saddened by the approach taken in the budget and will try to explain to the Minister of State why the Government got it wrong.I am not arguing with the figure of €470 million that had to be taken out of the social welfare budget.  Let us be honest: those who think we can go on spending in the way we did, with the same tax take and range of charges as heretofore, are patently wrong.  If that were the case, we would have to keep borrowing money.  This would quickly become unsustainable.  The way in which things were done, however, was wrong.  I therefore ask the Minister to consider putting the Committee Stage debate back to next week.  There are petty cuts that will not save significant amounts of money but that will hurt small numbers of people.  These decisions could easily be rectified within the figures.  I have some experience of this; the one thing I tried to avoid last year was making deep cuts on individuals.  If people suddenly find a few hundred euro disappearing from their weekly income and they are of modest means, it could be the tipping point for them.One of the problems with the way thing were done last Monday was that a lot of the micro-information was not made available.  For example, under the heading of "Other Measures", some €20 million has been provided.  This refers to administrative budgets, means-testing rationalisation, treatment benefit and other miscellaneous measures.  In some cases the bread will literally be taken from the mouths of ordinary people.  I want to put this matter in context.  The Department of Social Protection spends approximately €100 million a day.  I understand it makes payments during a ten hour period.  Therefore, this amounts to the equivalent of a two hour payment in the whole year.  That is what we are arguing about in the case of some of these meaningless measures which include home care and carer's allowance.The Minister of State could save himself a lot of trouble if he were to spent the weekend studying the data.  Unlike last year, there are no great time pressures.  We all know the circumstances that prevailed this time last year.  As I have no doubt the Minister of State hopes to be in office for five years, time is on his side.  He should, therefore, take time out this weekend to examine some of the harsher measures that might not save €1 million a year.  It amounts to margin-of-error stuff in the Department of Social Protection.  He should examine these measures and seek to have the Bill changed accordingly.  If we proceed to meet an arbitrary deadline of 3.30 p.m. today, the Government will always be remembered as the one which seemed to go after families, women in particular.   It chose the better-off ahead of the less well-off.I have the height of respect for the Minister of State, and we all serve the interests of the people.  Unlike what happened when we were in government, I will never say that any significant amount of people in this House have anything other than the good of the ordinary people at heart.  I have always objected to the allegation that we were acting for some big vested interest; the Minister of State knows this was not true and I know it is not true in the case of the current Government.Whether it is naïveté or purposeful policy, the Government made some strange decisions.  I will outline one which shows a philosophy that I find strange as an ex-Minister.  We can take the fuel allowance as it applies to pensioners.  That allowance is paid to those on a non-contributory pension, with an allowance of €100 per week.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	174	That is right.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	175	There is a very clear ceiling and a person would be in a household that does not have rich people as they are all excluded.  This is a household payment to people we are certain have limited income.  As I noted, the limit is the contributory pension plus €100 per week.  The Government cut that specific group by 19% with regard to fuel and electricity allowance.  On the other hand, all the pensioners over the limit of the contributory pension plus €100, or, by definition, on a non-contributory pension, will not see any cut at all.  What inverted logic allows this to be equitable?  I know pensioners with incomes of €50,000, €60,000 and €70,000 per year, from contributory widows' pensions for example, and they are not affected at all by this.I remember the debate on the Social Welfare Bill last year, when I was in the Minister of State's seat.  I said to Department of Finance officials that the fuel allowance should be increased, if anything, as it is a very efficient payment.  We can forget about it being for fuel as it is a supplementary cash payment to poor houses.  I told the officials they had missed the point.  If I had €100 million to give out, I would not put it in a general rise in pensions, as that would increase the pension of people who are already well-off, I would put it into the fuel allowance instead because I would be guaranteed the money would go to houses with long-term unemployed or people with disabilities.  We would know those households would be in relative poverty compared to the rest of society.In considering the issue this way, one can decide if it was clever to avoid hitting the middle and upper classes, who do most of the shouting.  They have perpetuated the urban myth that taking medical cards from millionaires was in some way cruel when young families on tight incomes cannot get it.  There is a perfect example in farming circles, as the big farmers march the small farmers to Dublin to do the deal for big farmers, leaving smaller farmers ar a bharraí géar  With medical cards, the rich people frightened the poorer people by saying they would lose the medical card, which they would not, and managed to save their cards.  We correctly took out the top 5%.  How can it be justified to have people on €100,000 per year having a medical card in straitened circumstances?The philosophy of the budget seems quite clever but very flawed.  Instead of taking a little from a lot, which might have annoyed many people but would have been equitable as wealthier people on social welfare would have taken a hit, the Government has focused on taking a lot from a little.  In going that route, as I could have foretold, the most vulnerable people must be hit.  We can see what has been done.We can take the effects on women, particularly vulnerable women, as an example.  Women with big families get hit through child benefit decreases but women with small families do not get hit at all.  We all know that the more children a family has, the more difficult it is on a fixed income.  Child benefit does not pay the cost of rearing a child.  The Government reduced the entitlement to lone parents over the next few years to when the youngest child turns seven, which the Government parties opposed completely when in opposition.  We had a debate on this as there was an initial proposal for the age to be 13 and I put it back to 14.  The kids in secondary school are somewhat independent and when they come home from school in the evening, they are mobile and can stay in a neighbour's house, for example.  I fully bought the argument that a child of seven or eight cannot be given a key or told to go to a neighbour's house.  There are exceptional costs for a lone parent, and the idea of forcing them to the live register when we cannot get jobs for those already on the register is just a way of saving money.There has been a cut of €29.80 for those on the community employment schemes, with a three or five year slide as well.  The earnings disregard over five years is being reduced from €146 to €60.  Over three years there is a stipulation that a person cannot be on community employment schemes and get either disability payment or a lone parent payment.  Some 90% of single parent families are women.There is a very mean anti-women provision in the small print.  I do not have the details of the figures.  The Government has stipulated that anybody who does not have an average of 48 contributions per year will have a very reduced pension compared to the current benefit.  Currently, a person loses a few euro if there are between 20 and 48 contributions.  Why is that anti-women?  Women are the predominant group who start employment, work for five or ten years, leave employment and go back at a later stage.  If a woman did not work to begin with she would be okay, even if she only did ten years at the end.  The Minister of State knows from people in his clinic that when there is such a break, the average contribution is reduced.  Women are mostly caught this way.  What is the focus on getting women in this way?Women may leave employment because of the norms of society, with some having had to leave because of the marriage bar.  Women are also hit with regard to the contributory widows' pension.  Instead of needing stamps for three years, the stipulation is now ten years.  As a result, young widows with low incomes will be left in a vulnerable position.On the Order of Business I read out an e-mail from a lady who may be down €330 with her family income supplement, and she is one of the lucky ones.  Anybody on that payment is not living the high life.  She is a carer and in many cases these people are caring for people 24 hours a day.  We took the view when in government that caring is not a social welfare payment but a payment for hard work.  It is not received when a person does nothing.  There is the idea of helping the neighbour, cabhair le gcomharsa.  The means test disregard for that is being eliminated.  I know there are logical reasons, which were put to me when I worked with the Department, and some have interesting historical origins.  At a time of extra pressure on people, we are targeting small groups and taking much from them cumulatively.I am broken-hearted for the people who will lose hundreds of euro in this budget.  I know the backbenchers are interested in the good of people, which I would not take from fellow politicians.  They are also interested in their seats.There is nothing wrong with that either because one cannot change anything if one is not in the House.  They would much prefer the Government to take time out to change, in particular, the minor provisions which will not save significant amounts of money.  I know this from being in the Department.  The Government should take time out over the weekend, rethink the approach and come back next week with a revised Bill that would be fairer and spread the load more equitably.  In particular, the cuts should not all be loaded on the most vulnerable.  I could give examples all day of where we seem to be targeting all those who are means tested, while those who are on social welfare and have other private means seem to be getting away scot free.  It is not fair or equitable.In ainm Dé, the Aire Stáit, Deputy Ring, is a fair man.  I urge him to get someone to replace him in the House and tell the Government to take time out to reconsider some of the crazy decisions made.

Given what went on, how often did he go home content for Christmas in the past ten years?I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is always difficult for a Government Deputy to defend cuts in a budget, but we are living in extraordinary times after years of disastrous decisions made by the previous Government.  I accept this was a tough budget.  We would all have preferred not to have to make such decisions, but the reality is that we have no choice.  We inherited an €18 billion euro deficit which we have to fill.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said on Tuesday:The people of Ireland have paid a high price for this mismanagement of the economy.  Personal wealth has been destroyed, thousands of people are sinking into poverty, emigration has returned and unemployment is far too high.The Government has made a very good start.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I know from speaking to colleagues in other countries that we have restored our reputation abroad.  People are no longer talking about this country in negative terms.  They are speaking about how we have restored credibility to the country in the short time we have been in government.  Even the international press speak about us in a favourable manner, unlike the way we were portrayed in the past two years.Abraham Lincoln said, "You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today."  We have a responsibility to the country to make the hard decisions now in order that we can bring it back from the brink.  We want to do this in a fair way.  We also want to be open and transparent with the people, as has been the case in the past six months since we came to power.  Given the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves, the budget has been fair.  To close the €18 billion gap, we had to make choices.  There was no easy way out.  The Government's priority was to protect the most vulnerable, create jobs, streamline the public service and, most of all, protect people's pay packets.  We must regain control of our fiscal and economic policies in order that the economy can grow again.  That is the reason, even in these most difficult of circumstances, it is welcome that we have managed to deliver on the programme for Government commitments to maintain core social welfare rates, the current rates of income tax, introduce schemes such as the partial credit guarantee scheme and provide for the construction of a €100 million micro-finance start-up fund for small businesses.  It has gone over many people's heads that the Government has reversed the decision by the previous Administration to reduce the minimum wage.  In the budget we have eased the burden further on lower income workers by ensuring 330,000 people earning less than €10,000 will no longer have to pay the universal social charge.  This has been welcomed by many low income families, trade unions and the farming organisations.In spite of the difficult choices to be made, I remind Deputies on the Opposition benches that the previous Government proposed to slash the social protection budget by an additional €665 million next year.  The Government has managed to limit the adjustment to €475 million.  Perhaps some Opposition Members might explain to the House who was to pay the price for the additional cuts of €190 million proposed in Fianna Fáil's four year plan.

I welcome the comments of the Minister for Social Protection in the House yesterday on disability allowance payments for young people.  I understand the intention was not to reduce their benefits and welcome the fact that the issue is being revisited.  Backbenchers played an important role in that regard.  The issue will be dealt with before March.When the dust settles after a budget is announced, there are always queries about a number of proposals.  When I was in opposition, it was always the case that there were queries.  It is worth talking about genuine concerns, but there has also been much hysteria, in particular from the Opposition, such as the scaremongering that took place before the budget.

The Minister is correct, the schemes play a valuable role.  They often provide services, particularly in rural areas, which would not otherwise be provided.  Every parish has a community employment scheme which plays a valuable role.  That is true of my constituency in which they underpin the provision of many essential community services.  For example, the family resource network provides family supports, information and advice at local level in the four corners of County Clare, in Kilrush, Ennistymon, Killaloe and Shannon.  Community employment schemes also have an important role to play and do much good work in GAA and Tidy Towns organisations.  Numerous Tidy Towns organisations sponsor such schemes, without which the achievements in restoring pride of place in their communities would not be possible.  In some areas, the schemes have facilitated schools to employ secretaries such as in my local school at Ballynacally.  On local radio yesterday, I heard Mr. Brian Higgins of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions say that many of the schemes will collapse if material and training grants are reduced.The proposed changes are designed to reform one element of the funding of CE schemes.  There is no intention to axe the schemes.  The Minister is undertaking a value for money analysis of the schemes.  It would be helpful if the Minister would comment on this when she replies to the debate today, so as to draw a line under the scaremongering that is taking place.  I ask the Minister to clarify that matter.I could have spoken on other issues, particularly the employer's rebate on redundancy payment which could put pressure on the Department of Social Protection and which could be looked at again, but time has beaten me.  I am delighted to have had an opportunity to contribute to the debate.

#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I was pleased to hear from one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies yesterday that his party could share part of the responsibility for the state of the country.  I remind all those members of the previous Government who are still in the House that they are totally responsible for the fact that our small country is on its knees.  For the past 15 years, Fianna Fáil-led Governments used money to win elections.  They threw money away as if there were no tomorrow and created a massive property bubble.  This was not their own money.  It was borrowed.  That is why we are now €18 billion in debt.  We are left in a very dark place, with a massive budget deficit and a lower tax intake.  We know the country is in a difficult economic position and no one in the House wants to cut people's entitlements.  Unfortunately, due to the reckless spending of the past number of years, we are left with very few choices.  As a Member of one of the Government parties, I take full responsibility for the budget that is being debated today.In the past couple of days, I have listened to Members of the Opposition speak about our European Union membership.  Our membership of the European Union, for which the Irish people voted, has had a positive impact.  We have made huge gains as a result of our membership.  The EU has funded schools, roads, farms and community projects across the country.  Funding from Europe has enabled people in our communities to help run community employment schemes, breakfast clubs, after-school projects, higher education and other resources.  More than ever, in these challenging times, we need the help of our European partners to sustain many of these projects.  As an EU member state, we were able to ask for help with our financial crisis.  The European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund bailed us out and brought the country back from the brink of bankruptcy.  We are now obliged to pay back our debts.  This applies to all of us, or to anyone who has taken out a loan.Last February, the Government was given a mandate by the Irish people. It took on the responsibility of rebuilding Ireland and reviving our economy.  No one denies that lifestyles will have to change and we all have that ahead of us in the coming months.  There will be changes across the spectrum.  The Minister for Social Protection faces a bill of nearly €20.5 billion this year.  Savings have to be found and difficult decisions have to be taken.  Some people will receive less money from the State than in previous times.  The reduction in some social welfare schemes is unpopular and I commend the Minister on leaving the majority of payments intact.  The budget is as fair as it can be, given the state of our public finances.I have met many people in my constituency who have worked hard and paid taxes.  They have been distraught to see some people who are not working and in receipt of social welfare payments earning the same amount of money as they do, having got out of bed in the morning and gone to work.  That is where fairness comes into play.  Those who have contributed to the State must be helped and supported when they lose their jobs.  We must also support those who cannot work, especially those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.We cannot, and I will not, condemn all those earning high wages.  Many of these people have studied hard, progressed their careers and carry great responsibility in their jobs.  As a parent who has young children still in school and college, I would like to believe that some day, after their hard work and study, they may become some of the high earners and will not be condemned for holding those positions.I welcome the Minister's decision to review the changes to the disability allowance.  She has listened, not only to comments from Deputies on the Government side but also to those of Opposition Deputies and of families with children who have severe disabilities and rely on disability allowance.  It is important to support these families.Earlier, Deputy Ó Cuív referred to getting things wrong.  Many things were got wrong in the past number of years.  He told us we should go home and clear our consciences.  I have a clear conscience and I will face into the Christmas season with a clear conscience.  There is only one person to whom I need to confess, and that person is not in this Chamber or on this earth.

Otherwise, we will be back in the place where we have been for the past number of years.I wish circumstances were different.  I come from a community where I have worked since I was very young, first as a volunteer and now as a public representative.  I know the needs of many of the people in my community.  I do not need to be reminded.   Unfortunately, for me and for many people, particularly those in public life, times have changed.  I wish I was standing here saying something different about a budget I believe has flaws.  However, as a Member who wants to make changes for the people in my constituency, for my children's future and for my grandchild, I believe this is one of the steps we must take to correct what has happened in the past.  I will not be drawn into mud-slinging in this Chamber because that is not what this budget is about.  We live in a time of serious challenge and I am prepared, as a Member of the Government side of the House, to take on those challenges and to help bring about change and a better future for everybody in the country.

People believed the last Government to have been dishonest in its dealings with them.  They were told the economy was on a sound footing, when it was collapsing all around us, that the IMF was not coming into the country, when they arrived the next day, and so on.  On the issue of fairness, there is a decency in Irish people and they came to the view that they would have to make some sacrifices and they did that.  However, as they made those sacrifices, they watched bankers, developers, speculators who were creaming off society go untouched.  Therefore, they voted out the last Government on these two issues.What has changed?  If we speak to the man in the street, nothing has changed.

These are the statistics provided by the Government, which it received from Social Justice Ireland a few weeks ago.

#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Last year, Deputy Joan Burton was rightly indignant in her response to the budget.  She said:I dare say the Minister must be aware that people with children took the biggest cuts this year and last year.  Let us remember, child benefit is paid almost universally to women.  I suppose that is a comment on how few women are Members of this House and what little political power women exercise compared to bankers.  The Minister always says yes to bankers, but in his different budgets, he always finds it difficult to make payments in respect of children.The Minister is hypocritical, as she has cut child benefit again this year.  I call on her to reverse those cuts and not only to review the disability allowance cuts, but to reverse them also.I wish to refer to the community employment schemes.  These schemes are hugely advantageous to communities throughout the country and in every town, village and city.  They are now at risk and many of them have collapsed because of the cuts, from €1,500 to €500 for the materials, maintenance and training grants.  These schemes support disability services, meals on wheels, child care services, tidy towns and sports centres all over the country.  The Minister must reverse these cuts.  She should equally reverse the cuts to lone parents, widows and widowers and recipients of disability allowance who participate in those schemes.  They will see huge cuts in their income as a result of this budget.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Before I go into the details of the legislation, I wish to say that I find it hard to believe that in the current economic climate and with this current budget we have a Minister called the Minister for Social Protection.  Think about it.  Ask the poor, the sick, senior citizens or the disabled where there is any protection from these cuts.  Ask those working in community employment where there is any social protection from the 66.6% cut in their funding.  Let us be realistic, straight and honest with the people.  How can cutting fuel allowance be a social protection for our senior citizens?  The Minister must see the point.  This is not on.  It is shameful and a disgrace.Today, at 2 p.m. we will have the representatives of 22,474 people on community employment schemes at the gates of Leinster House.  I will support them strongly and I urge all Members with backbone to go out and meet these people.  They have taken a cut of 66% in their funding and that is the truth.  I challenged the Tánaiste on the way he responded to some of these questions this morning.  As well as sticking it into the disabled and senior citizens with the fuel allowance, the Government is now sticking into the people on community employment schemes, which provide services for the disabled and poor people.It is a pity Deputy Byrne is no longer here.  I say to her and to the Government that they must get off the high moral ground with regard to talking about taking tough decisions.  That side of the House was in opposition last time around and the ranting and raving that used to go on over on this side then was mind blowing.  They should not come along now and defend the situation.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I will stand up for the people and for the disabled and senior citizens.  My record speaks for itself, which is why I am here for my third termIt is time for this Government to get off the stage and to look objectively at the facts with regard to this budget.  The ESRI, a non-political body, examined the budget closely and it stated that its examination of the impact of cuts and taxes shows that the better-off took the smallest hit.  Look at the impact of the 2012 budget.  It is clear that the greatest reduction in income is for those on the lowest incomes, a fall of from 2% to 2.5% for the poorest 40% of households.  This compares with the fall of close to 1% for the next 40% and there is a 0.8% fall for the top 20%.  In other words, even those who speak objectively say the Government has cut the weakest sections of society the most.  It should be ashamed of itself.I received a letter this morning from the principal of a disadvantaged school on the north side of Dublin who pointed out the real world for him.  First, some 250 teachers in disadvantaged primary schools are to be transferred out to solve the increased pupil levels nationally.  In other words, in his school, the pupil teacher ratio of 15:1 has gone to 22:1 and the principal's non-teaching post has been lost.  The learning support system has been changed.  The support teacher scheme is no longer in place, as confirmed by the Department.  As a result of the cuts, the number of staff is down to 4.4.  This is a very disadvantaged school on the northside of Dublin.  Those in government who talk about protecting the vulnerable and the weak in society conned the people when in opposition and they are conning them again in government.The Minister said in respect of disability services, that the cut was only 2%.  However, I have information from disability groups that in some areas the cut is 4.7%.  I will return to this issue.I urge the Minister not to take carer's allowance into account in assessing social welfare applications or government services.  Carers are also being attacked.  I urge the Government to change its mind because we will fight this decision to the very end.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	220	We must see the Bill in the context of the overall deficit adjustment required.  We all know it is impossible to make a €3.8 billion adjustment without causing some pain.  Many have said there will have to be more.  I read some of the analyses yesterday which stated ours was the lowest adjustment in the five eurozone countries in distress.  Our growth projections are now so low that it is probable we will miss our growth and deficit targets and that the Government will be back to introduce a supplementary budget some time in 2012.There are elements in the budget which I welcome.  Moving towards shared services is a great idea, as is placing the focus on the use of generic drugs.  Moving to consolidated procurement practices is also welcome.  However, these things are difficult to do, as they are complex.  I wish the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and his team all the best and hope they can extract as much effectiveness from this as possible.I welcome the widening of the universal social charge band in the Bill.  The readjustment of child benefit payments is reasonable within the current context.  The focus on reducing fraud in the welfare system is long overdue.  It is welcome that current social welfare bands will be maintained, which is very significant, although I do not believe the Government will be able to maintain this further than perhaps the next 12 months.I also congratulate the Minister for Social Protection on her roll-back on the disability issue.  I refute the media commentary that this is, in some way, politically embarrassing.  We must allow Ministers and fellow Members to make mistakes and to listen to the people, their party members and members of the Opposition.The Bill and the budget in their totality need to meet two conditions.  They need to be fair and effective.  It is reasonable to assert that they are unfair, as we know, mathematically, this is a regressive budget.  The sums have been done and we have seen the reports and know it hits the poorest the hardest and that it directly targets lone parents, small business owners, students and participants in community employment schemes.  Until recently, it targeted people with disabilities.  However, those at the top will remain relatively untouched.The Bill is also regressive.  By any reasonable definition in a western democracy, it is unfair.  The only rationale for introducing something we would all agree was unfair is if it would be incredibly effective and make the county less equal, that we would create a large number of jobs and, therefore, everyone would benefit in the long run.  The theory the Government has stated it is using is that if one is trying to create jobs, one does not tax labour, rather one taxes consumption.  In a normal economy and in normal times, that is true, but in this economy and at this time it is not.  The Government is applying incorrectly basic economic theory to a complex issue.  I know it is trying to create jobs, but this application of economic theory will achieve exactly the opposite.VAT is being increased by 2%.  We know that small businesses will close down as a result.  The Government's own logic for its jobs initiative is that by reducing VAT jobs will be created.  If we look broadly at the figures the Government has suggested for its jobs initiative, increasing the VAT rate will probably put tens of thousands out of work.  It will cost hundreds of millions of euro in social welfare and result in a lack of returns to the Exchequer.  We know it will drive people over the Border.There are issues around the employers redundancy rebate.  We know this decision will accelerate redundancies as employers try to get them through before the budget measures take effect.  Pension contributions for employers are also being increased.  The Government is passing a massive bill from the State to small business owners.  It has not been able to differentiate between large multinationals which can afford redundancy payments and small businesses which simply cannot afford to do so.  People have contacted my office — I am sure other Deputies have been contacted, too — to say they run a small business in Wicklow or some other location and that they will now have to put one to five people out of work.  That is happening.  The economic theory the Government is applying will achieve exactly the opposite of what it is trying to do, which is to create jobs.We need further analysis.  There has been no analysis of the impact on poverty which I believe the Minister is legally obliged to provide.  The level of analysis on the issue of VAT is ridiculous.  The Government is counting on having €670 million in additional revenue, but it assumes there will be no drop in consumption.  There will probably be a drop to the tune of more than €150 million.  The Government assumes there will be no redundancies, but there will.  We have not seen any regulatory impact or gender impact analysis.  These are critical in establishing which are the most and the less harmful provisions and I would like to see them.I have absolutely no doubt my contribution will not change a single line in the budget or the Social Welfare Bill, but when the Minister for Finance and his colleagues are coming up with a supplementary budget and considering policy for next year, I ask them to, at least, consider that the application of the economic theory being used will achieve the exact opposite of what it is they want to achieve.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  Following on from what previous speakers said, this is a totally regressive budget which will drive jobs out of the country.  There is nothing more certain than this.I refer to small businesses.  The whopping 45% cut in the redundancy payments rebate is unbelievable.  I have been in that position and availed of the scheme when things got slack.  The Minister is right to go after the large multinationals which run off after they have availed of the tax exemptions.  However, this measure will prove detrimental to small businesses.The fuel allowance is to be cut by €120.  How does the Minister expect elderly people or anybody else for that matter in receipt of fuel allowance to manage?  Are we going to have sunshine after all the doom and gloom?  Are we going to have shorter winters?  This is despicable.I listened to the Minister speak after the announcement of last year's budget and for four years at the committee and there has been a turnaround.  On what planet has she been put?  Fine Gael put her in this position.  It made sure she was given the Department of Social Protection to silence her.  Not only has she become silent, she has also become invisible.  I have been in the Chamber for most of the morning and she has not appeared.When those opposite go home and attend their clinics this weekend——

The former Minister for finance, the late Brian Lenihan, took the measure out of a budget, but someone in the Department did not shred it and the Minister put it back in.  The Government would have gone ahead with it if it had not experienced the wrath of the public.As Deputy Donnelly said, the Minister will be back with a supplementary budget because this one will not work.  Because of the extra 2% in VAT, people will not be able to spend and small businesses will shed jobs rather than take people off the dole.There has been a cut made in respect of community employment schemes.  I am the chairperson of a community employment scheme in my locality and this cut is disastrous.  We will not be able to put in place progressive training schemes.  I could quote the figures for costs, but I will not go into them because the Minister knows what they are.  Some 5,000 people will be in debt even before the scheme starts next year.The cuts are regressive.  I do not know where the rural and urban Deputies were when they were supposed to be discussing the fairness and reasonableness of the budget.  Fairness went out the window when the Government looked after the big people and forgot the small people, as did previous Governments.  Fine Gael is present, but where is the Labour Party?

I have stayed in government to ensure patient safety and the hospital's future.  All I ask is that, in a year's time, people driving by the hospital will recognise what happened.I appreciate Deputy Donnelly's comments, in that, if a mistake is made, one should put one's hands up and row back.  This is not a question of admitting defeat, but of doing the right thing.  Through the Social Welfare Bill, we are trying to do the right thing, including returning people to work.  I do not agree with some of its provisions, but we must do the right thing.An Independent colleague has castigated me for nine months and called me a liar, which is a word that cannot be used in the Chamber, a traitor and a coward.  Everything I have done in that time I have done in the interests of the people of my constituency.  In terms of turf cutting, I stated that I would write my name in blood.  We have since delivered for turf cutters.  Hundreds, if not thousands, of them will get €1,000 per year for the next 15 years thanks to the agreement we signed.

I hope the Bill's provisions are fair.  I do not agree with some of its measures.  In four years time, we will say "Goodbye" to the IMF at Dublin Airport and the country will be economically sovereign again.  I will support the Bill.  The new poor and those who cannot afford to pay must be protected.  This situation evolved because of light touch regulation and bankers have got away scot free.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	318	This is my first budget and the imbalance in the debate is striking.  The reality is that next year we will spend €20.5 billion on social welfare and there is never any talk about where it comes from except for these dreadful rich people from whom we must take money because they are the bane of society and we all want to be so equal.  The way people protest around here is disingenuous because it gives the impression there are those for people and those against them.  If we look at the circumstances of the people making those speeches, they are on the same wages as those on this side of the House, aside from the technicalities of the points being debated there.The idea people are holding hands with the poor is disingenuous.  There should be always a debate about social welfare, about where it goes and from where the money to pay for it comes.  A lot of what I have heard in the debate is the peddling of misery, scaring people while not having a conversation about what people are entitled to and who pays for it.  Often in these debates, we hear something is being taken away but who is paying for it?  Most of the time it is the taxpayer but at the moment the IMF is making up the shortfall.  These people are not fantastically rich but have worked and worked.  There are many of them who feel the social welfare system has been operating in an insane fashion over the years and that it has been open to abuse and exploitation, driving people away from working.That does not solve the issue of those who really need help.  A good social welfare state is a safety net we all might need at some point, we do not know.  It seems as though it is unchallenged, that begrudgery, which privately people might consider an Irish trait, is being glorified, particularly begrudgery of the wealthy, whether they inherited their wealth or earned it, or whether they are entrepreneurs or the innovative, the sort of people we would like to think could be confident that they have a place in the country, that they are not being demonised because of their wealth, that they will invest in the country and will not move assets out of it because this is a country where the politicians hold hands with the poor.  That is a joke because the poor are not fooled into thinking politicians are holding their hands.  We do our best by people but we must have debate not just about their rights, but about their responsibilities to the nation as a citizen.As the Bill is drafted, the redundancy provision that cuts back from 60% to 15% is a crude instrument.  That would mean employers would have to pay 85% of the redundancy.  Small, family run businesses have been trading for years and want to hold on until there is an upturn and many of them have been operating without taking any earnings out of the business.  They want to hold on to their employees because they have faith in the country that it will lift.  Now, their decision is being tilted by the fact that if things do not work out for them and they go to the wall, they must ask how they will meet the payment to employees who have been loyal to them.  It is all very well for a multinational or an incorporated entity that can hide behind the corporate veil if it goes insolvent but there should be special provision for the sole trader and for the small business because this is significant for them and thousands of jobs could be lost even as we speak while people weigh up their options on account of this new development.  These people do not want to be told to send their employees to the insolvency fund; they want to trade their way out and want to see brighter days but they are being forced to make tough decisions.Some people claim that if they bring in this quickly, they will not be able to serve redundancy papers but that is a cynical position to put genuine people into when they will not be able to carry the 85% payment.  Will they have to remortgage?  In many small businesses, the home is the collateral security for debts.  Why are we putting these people in this situation to tackle a problem that is higher up the line where we have multinationals who leave the country and we have to pay the redundancy for their staff?This measure will push employers into letting go employees.  Why would I keep an employee for 15 years and incur this burden?  I would keep turning over my employees.  That is not what we want, we want employees to be treated fairly and employers to have confidence in their employees.  This development at a time when businesses are holding on by their fingernails is not welcome and should be looked at to protect the unincorporated small business and sole trader.  They do not have the protection of the corporate veil, which in our capitalist society has been highly abused.  We see reckless developers who are still fine and who still have their homes because they are protected by the corporate veil while subcontractors who were not protected and who offered personal guarantees to keep businesses operating have gone to the wall.  The corporate veil has been abused and I would like to see this classification of person protected and given hope because they are staying in business.  They are not getting start up money so they should be given some encouragement.I made my inquiries in my area and it is very well served by CE schemes, such as the Tidy Towns and the local arts centre.  My understanding is that the cut in the materials allowances will have little impact on clerical schemes in offices but in environmental schemes where people need shovels and coats, such as Tidy Towns, and health and safety courses, money is needed.  I would welcome a provision whereby there is discretion and organisations that do not need the money do not get it, and those CE schemes that need money get it.The stopping of double payments will impact on lone parents.  For lone parents, a CE scheme is an ideal option.  It gives the flexibility to still care for children while an extra income comes in.  The problem here for lone parents is child care.  I was talking to a French woman who lives here and she told me that in France she would pay €5 a day for child care but she pays €50 a day for a child minder here and she must work.  Child care is one of the biggest burdens lone parents must face when finding work.  The CE scheme worked well for lone parents but the cancelling of the double payment points to a problem with child care.  It is unsatisfactory.  We are talking about women and children because normally women are caring for the children and they will be worst affected.  We must address the issue, particularly if we want to encourage people to work.  It cannot be so prohibitive that people work to pay for child care.There are many cases where women must pursue the fathers of their children, irrespective of whether they are married to them, for maintenance.  There is a general view the State will look after them.  Clearly this is not the way to go; there should be a centralised service to pursue these people.  In many cases there is money for everything but there is no money to look after the children when the children should be always the priority.I balance that, however, by saying the way our family law system works is poor and the way unmarried fathers are treated in this country is poor.  Much of the legislation serves to emasculate men.Hand in hand with asking fathers, whether married or unmarried, working or not working, to take on responsibility for their children is also recognising the relationship a child has with his or her father and if possible should have with his or her father.  Regardless of who he is or what his background is, this is a right of a child.  There has been much talk about the role of fathers but nothing has been done about it.  We do a grave injustice to the men of our country and the children of our country.  I would like to see considerable reform in that area.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I call Deputy McConalogue who is sharing time with Deputy Healy-Rae.  As the Minister must reply at 1.15 p.m., the Deputies have approximately seven minutes each.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill.  As a first-time Deputy I find it strange that so little time is being given to debate the Bill.  I know this is not unusual for such a Bill after the budget, but it is a poor reflection on our national Parliament that we drive a Bill with measures that have such an important effect on people through the system as quickly as we are doing today.  For all the talk about reforming the process for introducing and dealing with budgetary proposals, to treat the Social Welfare Bill in this way is out of kilter with the rhetoric on reform of the budgetary system.  Pushing the Bill through today reflects that it contains very tough measures and the Government wants it enacted as quickly as possible so people do not get time to digest its contents and therefore to come back to lobby Government and backbenchers for change.Many of the measures are regressive.  I watched the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on Vincent Browne's television programme during the week.  He was asked to outline how he would be affected by the budget and the only measure he could point to was that he would have to pay 2% more in the standard rate of VAT just as everybody else will.  This is a reflection of how regressive the budget is.  Anyone in this Chamber is on a very generous salary by comparison with any normal person.  If any of us were to ask how these budgetary measures are affecting us or anybody else in a well paid job, we would struggle to find anything apart from measures that are also affecting people on much lower wages or dependent on social welfare.  A family on social welfare with three children may be losing €1,300.  For them to be affected by this budget to the same extent as a family with an income of €150,000 shows how regressive it is.  I find it hard to understand how the Labour Party can stand over a budget that has such an impact on people.I would like to address a few measures that have not had as much airing as they should have.  I highlight the proposed changes to widows' and widowers' pensions.  The Minister is increasing the number of PRSI contributions in order that a widow or widower can receive the contributory pension from 150 payments to what amounts to ten years.

It is a very sneaky cut because that is a constituency that has not formed yet, in that no one expects to become a widow or widower and therefore there is no lobby to oppose this measure as it only affects new entrants as widows or widowers.

I find it regrettable that she should attempt to target that.The Government has targeted the redundancy rebate scheme.  In selling and marketing this change, the focus has been on TalkTalk whenever headlines have been generated on the matter.  Unfortunately most businesses that are laying off people at the moment are doing so because they are on the breadline and are trying to keep their businesses operating.  Reducing the State rebate from 60% to 15% could be the death-knell for many of those companies that are already struggling to stay in business.  The Government needs to revisit this and find a way whereby companies in that situation can apply and continue to get the level of rebate they would have in the past.

Twelve months ago the Minister was on this side of the House berating the then Government and the people who supported it.  She called them everything under the sun and went out onto the plinth and said they were treating people in a disgraceful manner.  What they were doing at that time was nothing in comparison with what the Government is doing now.  When she came into her position she was sour because she did not get the Department she wanted.  The first thing she did was to get her new title — the Minister for lifestyle choice.

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	343	What manners has the Minister with the misery she will inflict on the people?  I will have my say.  I say to the Minister for lifestyle choice that I do not know anybody who is on welfare because he or she wants to be on welfare.  The people I know and represent want to work.  They want to get up in the morning, put on their shoes and go out to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  If they cannot get work, they are entitled to seek whatever they are entitled to.  The Minister is making it impossible for families to manage.  This is the budget the Government claimed it did not want to bring in.  Now that it has brought it in, it is much more draconian and harder on poor people.  They are the people affected by this budget.  Hundreds of poor working families face cuts of up to €120 per week based on the measures buried in the small print of the budget.  The hidden move will see cuts to family income supplement for those also in receipt of the carer's allowance.  I would like to read into the record a letter I received from a poor family, although I am sure the Minister does not want to hear it.  Poor families will be affected by what will be passed here today.  As stated by Deputy McConalogue, this legislation is being rushed through the House today because the Government does not want people to know what is happening.  The Government is rushing it through so that it will be in place before the people know what hit them.This budget is one of the meanest, most devious, ever introduced.

The proposed cuts to those schemes will result in the closure of schemes throughout the country and will put others in danger.  Local resource centres, which assist thousands of people, will be forced to close their doors.  These schemes play a vital role in the provision of services to those who are less well off, including the elderly, people with disabilities——

I urge the Government to reverse the cutbacks to the CE schemes and instead invest more money in them to make them more viable.  They also house many community and voluntary services that could be forced to cease operating in the event of their closure.  There are 22,000 people currently availing of community employment schemes, which provide training and upskilling.  CE participants also assist in the provision of key services for the unemployed and families.  CE schemes are important for rural Ireland and are availed of by many organisations.  The reduction in grant aid for such schemes will cause major problems.  While the amount involved is not large, funding towards the cost of training and materials form an important element of these schemes.  The future viability of hundreds of these schemes, owing to the 66% cut in funding announced as part of this budget in respect of materials and training, which provide vital services to children, the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged has been slashed from €1,500 to €500.

A lot of valid points were made.  I will try to deal with them as best I can.I reiterate that savings had to be made in the social welfare budget.  There were no easy options.  Every cut or change affects someone now or in the future.  We must balance our national income and expenditure.  Momentous events taking place in Europe may give us some easement or may make the situation in the coming year a whole lot more difficult.  We must address the deficit.Deputy Cowen at the beginning of his contribution spoke in glowing terms about the enormous increases of 300% plus in the social welfare budget at a time when inflation amounted to only a small amount.  When I came into office, I inherited cuts of more than €800 million from Deputy Healy-Rae's former party.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	440	For the first time in three years, there will be no cut in overall rates.  Deputy Healy-Rae's former party introduced a cut of €8 per week in all the primary rates, other than for old age pensioners.  I made a strategic decision——
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	441	It is a smoke screen.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	442	——to maintain the primary rates to give pensioners, people on jobseeker's benefit, lone parents, people on invalidity and disability allowances, certainty about their primary income rate.  As such, there is no cut in rates.  However, savings of €475 million must be made and, in addition, the social welfare system must be reformed to make it easier for people to be supported in education, training and employment.  As I have pointed out to Deputies previously, commitments were made to the troika in respect of reforming social welfare on the lines of single payments to people between the ages of approximately 18 and the time of retirement for those in their 60s.  This is the backdrop against which the Government addressed this.I have heard Members on all sides make clear their views regarding the cuts.  Members also have suggested that various groups should be excluded from cuts.  It is extremely difficult to take away anything from people who have relied on it and who have managed their personal budgets based on their main income, as well as the additional benefits they receive.  I am very sympathetic to all those who are struggling in adverse circumstances and am aware of the extent to which Members on all sides of the House are aware of this as it affects their constituents and, in some cases, members of their families.The fact remains, however, that in a budget of more than €20 billion, the Government has been obliged to make an overall cut of 2%.  It has tried to do this in a manner that is reforming and fair, while retaining the basic rate.  Last year, a family with three children would have had a cut in its child benefit of €10 per month, while someone in receipt of a jobseeker's payment would have lost €8 per week.  This is not happening this year and I hope this will allow people to spend with confidence——

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	680	The Bill, when enacted, may be cited as the Social Welfare Act 2011.  This is probably common procedure, as each new Bill has a Title based on the previous one.  However, given what is contained in it, it would be an insult to call this the Social Welfare Act 2011 because it is the exact opposite.  I am, therefore, disagreeing wholeheartedly with the Bill, given the level of cuts and the groups which have been targeted by the Minister in it.  I disagree with the Title, especially as children are being targeted by ways of the cuts to child benefit.  In addition, entitlement to domiciliary care is being affected.  Thankfully, the Minister for Social Protection listened to the furore over the decision on disability allowance before she went ahead on the bizarre idea that the disabled should shoulder the burden for speculators and gamblers.The other main group which the Minister is targeting in the legislation includes one-parent families.  At various committee meetings she repeatedly said there was a need to address poverty traps, but they are being added to in the Bill.  I have received a range of correspondence in recent days from people who are absolutely scared of the consequences of the Minister's actions this week.  At this stage in the deliberations I will not read the horror stories, but people have done the sums and understand what is happening.  In many cases, they are totally dependent on social welfare and do not have a spare 50 cent, never mind a euro, at the end of the week.  The money has often been accounted for before they receive it.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	681	The Deputy can deal with these matters when we reach another section.  He cannot do so on this section which contains the Short Title.

I am about to conclude to allow other Deputies to speak.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	683	Thank you, Deputy.

We had to fight to be given two hours for the debate on Committee Stage, yet we do not have even that amount of time now.  It is scandalous.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	685	I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy.  This measure should be called the social destruction Bill, not the Social Welfare Bill.  This legislation will hit people on social welfare through the reduction in qualified child increase.  It will also hit the eligibility of pensioners to receive contributory pensions.  It will hit widowers, child benefit and the one-parent family income disregard.  This will force single parents back into poverty.  The Bill should be described as a poverty creation measure as a counterpoint to all of the commitments made by the Government to provide for labour activation measures.  It is hitting the concurrent payment which will also hit lone parents.  In what sense, therefore, can the Minister for Social Protection talk about this being a social welfare Bill when all it will do is increase poverty levels?  It will increase the level of child poverty, as well as hitting lone parents and the elderly.  It will make things worse for some of the most vulnerable sections of society.  The Minister simply cannot stand over the Title of the Bill.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I also wish to oppose the Title of the Bill.  I said this last night, although the Minister was not present to listen to me.  According to its website, the Department's mission statement is to promote active participation in society by the provision of income supports, employment opportunities and other supports.  However, the Bill, if passed, will do the complete opposite.  It will discourage active participation by withdrawing income supports for certain sections of society.  For that reason, I oppose the Title of the Bill.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	687	I am not opposed to the Title and do not want to waste time by discussing it.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	691	Through detailed consideration I reduced those cuts to €475 million.  I regret, like everybody else in the House, that there must be any cut in social welfare.  Unfortunately, we were left in an EU-IMF structural adjustment programme and we must make expenditure reductions as well as general tax increases.  They are the terms and conditions of the programme Ireland is in until we can get back on our feet with regard to financial sovereignty.Last year, social welfare rates were cut across the board by €8 per week, with the exception of the old age pension.  Child benefit was cut by €10 per month for all children.  I made choices about what would be included in the €475 million of cuts.  Those choices have been welcomed by pensioners and many people on a different range of social welfare benefits.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	702	The title of this Social Welfare Bill is entirely appropriate.  The third element of the Bill deals with changes to refunds to employers for redundancy payments.  In the past number of years this country has spent over €1 billion paying employers redundancy rebates.  We have paid very large multinationals €12 million here and there, for example, with €13 million or €14 million going to SR Technics.  Diageo received a large amount of many millions of euro.

Will the Deputies think about that?  No other European country subsidises employers to make people redundant.  We are leaving a subsidy of 15% in place.  We are in terrible economic difficulty.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	710	——to a position where we can develop schemes and structures that will help employers to retain workers, whether on a full or part-time basis, rather than spending hundreds of millions of euro in each year of this appalling financial difficulty to make people redundant.  I know Deputy Cowen and others said they had a difficulty with the inclusion of this provision in the Bill.  It is very appropriate to try to reorganise the finances of social welfare in a way that provides the maximum amount of money available in very straitened times.I am delighted we have had no direct cuts in social welfare rates this year, and that is a considerable achievement compared to the €8 everybody lost last year——

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	764	There is a lack of detail in the implementation of this arbitrary definition of disablement.  On what basis is the definition made?  With what expertise is the decision being taken?  Does it affect the lump sum payment to be made?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	765	I oppose section 3 on the basis that it takes us down a dangerous road.  We have not had proper scrutiny or debate on the effects of the measure.  Is this a move towards degrees of disablement, which it seems to be?  In the future, will a person be entitled only to certain benefits?  The proposal in the Bill is to allow a payment for a limited disability of at least 15%.  Will we soon move to payments for 20%, 25% or 30% disablement?  Where is this leading us in the long term?  This measure should have been teased out before being included in legislation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	766	Section 3 provides for limiting the payment of disablement benefit in the case of assessments of loss of faculty of less than 15%.  Existing disablement benefit claimants who have qualified for payment before 1 January 2012 on the basis of assessments of less than 15% and cases where the accident occurred before 1 January 2012 but because they are incapable of work and claiming injury benefit they are not able to claim disablement benefit for a period of up to six months, will be protected.  These provisions will come into effect from the beginning of January 2012.Disablement benefit is a payment under the occupational injuries scheme which is payable to an insured person who suffers a loss of physical or mental health as a result of an occupational accident or a prescribed occupational disease.  Disablement benefit may be paid as a once-off gratuity or in the form of a disablement pension.  It can be paid in addition to any other social welfare payment, including illness benefit.  It is payable regardless of whether the claimant has returned to work.The measure contained in the section, which introduces a 15% minimum disablement threshold, does no more than bring the arrangements in Ireland into line with the approach taken in the United Kingdom, and places Ireland broadly in the mid-range of EU practice in this area.  Several EU member states have substantially higher thresholds in place, including Germany where the minimum threshold is 20% and the Netherlands where the threshold is 35%.Section 3 provides that entitlement to disablement benefit will be confined to those where the level of disability assessed is 15% or more and where the initial period of assessment commences on or after 1 January 2012.  The section also provides that claimants whose initial period of assessment has commenced prior to 1 January 2012 will not be subject to the new threshold.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	767	Section 4 deals with the changes to the current entitlement to the payment of a half-rate qualified child increase in a number of cases, such as carer's benefit and State contributory pension.I oppose this vehemently.  What is the prescribed amount?  Is it €400 or not?  What is it?  These are changes to the margins and greatly affect the people in question.  By how much would a person who is caught in this trap be affected?  How much would such a person lose per week?  The same person could be affected by the changes in child benefit.  If the two are added together how much would a person lose in that instance?Is this not contrary to the Minister's claim that there has not been a cut in welfare rates?  The effect of this section is to make two cuts within one.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	768	I agree with Deputy Cowen.  This is a low attack on the qualified child payment.  It is a decrease in a social welfare rate, yet the Minister has made great play of her claim that no social welfare rate has been cut.  I oppose the section on that basis alone.I also oppose it on the basis that it targets many who are dependent on social welfare payments.  Under the proposed changes, the current entitlement to the half-rate child increase is disappearing.  The Minister's aim is to discontinue that entitlement.  Once again, I ask the Minister to row back on this, particularly considering there was an alternative approach available.  A number of people outlined the changes required in the taxation system that would allow for social welfare payments to be retained at the rate they were at and which would allow the tax system to be tweaked and changed to penalise those who have most and force them to pay the greater share of the burden which has been laid on society by the previous Administration and the economic crisis.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	769	I also oppose this section.  The issue of child poverty should be central to social welfare.  In the framing of this budget, what analysis was done with regard to its impact on child poverty?  Even before the budget was announced, Barnardos estimated that some 130,000 children were living in poverty.  We could fill both Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium with the number of children living in poverty.  I would have thought that this group would have been one of the first groups to be considered in the framing of a budget and that the impact of any cuts on this group would have been evaluated.  It seems that the headline rates have been protected for one reason, because they are the ones that make the news.  The impact of the cuts we are discussing here is more fragmented and is personal to the individuals who must work out how they will be absorbed.  This is quite cynical.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	770	There is a common theme to many of the Minister's cuts.  What these cuts will do is attack people and families trying to make their way forward, who want to work and contribute to society and get out of poverty.  These cuts will act as a disincentive to work and will hit people at the margin of a certain level of earnings.  This is wrong.  The suggested threshold is €400.  If the other spouse is on social welfare and they have two or three children, the hit will be €60 or €90 a month if they happen to be just above the threshold.  An amount of €600 is not a lot for a family with children.  Therefore, the Minister is hitting people at the low end, people who are trying to work and contribute, and is taking a significant chunk from them.  That is the difference between poverty and some sort of living standard for people who are working and trying to contribute to society.  This is wrong.  It hits the people who should not be hit and the Minister should withdraw it.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	771	The idea of giving a half rate was to try to support people who paid their contributions.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, €400 a week is not a big income.  Am I correct in thinking that the loss of income through this change is as follows?  For a family with four children half of the rate per child is €15, if we ignore the 20 cent on the full €29.80.  If we multiply that by four it comes to €60.  There is also a cut of €19 a month on the third child allowance and €17 a month on the fourth child.  When we add those two, we get a cut of €36 and if we divide that by four it comes to €9.  Therefore, will the Minister confirm that this cut for families earning between €400 and €500 will mean a cut of €70 per week?  The Minister should remember that when we compare this to cuts at the top end.  People at that end were screaming about cuts of €70 a week.  This cut is €70 a week.  Am I right or wrong?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	772	Section 4 provides for discontinuing the current entitlement to the payment of a half rate qualified child increase, where the spouse, the civil partner or the cohabiting partner of the beneficiary has a weekly income in excess of a prescribed amount, with effect from 1 July 2012.  With regard to the incapacity supplement payable under the occupational injury benefit scheme, it extends the reference to spouse of a beneficiary to include a reference also to the civil partner or the cohabitant of the beneficiary.  This amendment will take effect from the enactment of the Bill.The measure introduces for the first time an upper income limit on spouse-partner earnings for entitlement to the half rate qualified child increase.  It will be no longer payable where a recipient spouse or partner has earnings in excess of €400 per week.  Of course, they could be earning a lot more than €400 per week.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	773	They could be on only €400 a week.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	774	The majority of claimants affected by this measure will be those with a spouse or partner who is in full-time employment with earnings considerably in excess of the €400 threshold.  That is the data available to the Department.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	775	Why did the Minister not put it at €800?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	776	This directs available resources towards the families at the lower end, which is what the Deputy indicated he wanted to do.  Where there is a spouse or partner who is not earning or is on low earnings, below €400, the conditions relating to the qualified child increase are not affected and the payment continues.  This measure facilitates the introduction of a single social systems payment for people of a working age by aligning the arrangements for the specified schemes with current arrangements for illness benefit, injury benefit and jobseeker's benefit.I think Deputy Ó Cuív may be under a misapprehension.  This will just apply to new claimants.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	777	I know that.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	778	The Deputy implied there was a cut to existing claimants.  In case people are listening in, it does not affect any existing claimants.  It applies to new claimants next year.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	779	The disability issue did not affect existing claimants either, yet a pause was put on it.  It is time we found the eject button, rather than the pause button.  Apart from that, the Minister mentioned that some people were earning "considerably more than €400".  Why did she not put in the words "a considerable amount more than €400" rather than €400?  Can we amend the €400 to €800?  Would that be considerably more than the €400, to disbar anybody earning that sort of money from this entitlement?  I acknowledge that existing claimants will retain what they had budgeted for and continue to budget for on the basis of what they receive.  However, it is wrong to set a figure of €400 and then to tell us that what she means is "considerably more than €400".  Fifty cent extra is more than €400.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	780	What I said is that the data available to the Department indicates that this is used where people's partners, spouses, cohabiting persons are in full-time employment and the earnings indicators are significantly in excess of €400 a week.  In the context of how Fianna Fáil left the country — Deputy Ó Cuív was a member of that Government and sat in on the bank guarantee and so on — we, unfortunately, inherited an agreement on structural adjustment entered into by the Fianna Fáil Party with the IMF and the troika.  Rather than doing what Deputy Ó Cuív did last year — cut everybody's payment by €8 a week and child benefit by €10 a month — we have kept all the primary rates intact.  I thought that would have pleased the Deputy because the cuts he made last year followed cuts made the previous year of €8.30 a week on all payments, bar old age pension.  The cut to child benefit that year was €10 a month.  We have pressed the pause button on the weekly rates.  As the Deputy will know, most people on social welfare receive the primary rate, but there are those whose spouses, thankfully, work.  In that respect, there is an income in excess of €400 a week coming into the house.  In order to provide resources, we are limiting the measure to those with less than €400 a week.  Given the mess in which the country was left,  we had difficult choices to make.  I would prefer if we did not have to make this change.Under the social welfare system there is an extraordinary number of schemes, allowances, disregards and so on.  One of the commitments Fianna Fáil entered into with the troika was to have single age payments, in other words, somebody from the age of 18 years to the time he or she retires will, broadly, be in the same framework, whether it be on jobseeker's, lone parent's or disability payments.  This is part of that process.If we have economic recovery, it will be so much easier to carry out these necessary reforms.  It is such a pity that when Deputy Cowen talked yesterday about there being 300% increases in social welfare payments during Fianna Fáil's time in office, the opportunity was not taken to introduce reforms.  Deputy Ó Cuív knows the system is very complex and that we are under pressure from our partners in the troika because we are borrowing money to pay, in part, social welfare payments.  One of the reasons the country went into deficit was that when the building boom ended, the taxes raised through building, construction and property development and so on ebbed away and we were left reliant on what ordinary people paid through their taxes and PRSI on wages and in VAT.I wish we were doing this in a time of plenty.  I would have liked to bring in a budget based on extra resources being available to everybody in need, but we are not in that position and, therefore, must prepare a budget in the knowlege that much more limited resources are available.  What I find disappointing is that while Opposition Members want to preserve basic rates — most of them have acknowledged we inherited a very difficult economic situation——
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	781	The Minister has said that three times.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	782	——they want to oppose everything.  The amendment will affect new claimants; it will not affect existing claimants.  There was scaremongering in some of the contributions I heard, rather than giving the good and positive message that all basic rates will be maintained, unlike what happened in the past two years.  There is not a cut of €8 or €8.30 a week, the size of the cuts Fianna Fáil made to basic rates on which most rely.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	783	I wish to focus on a simple point.  Of course, there are very rich pensioners who have not been touched.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	784	Does the Deputy want to cut pensions?  That is a new Fianna Fáil policy.

When in opposition, she always talked about poverty traps, but she has created a great new one and I will explain how.  If one's spouse is earning €380 a week and the amount increases to more than €400, one will lose €70.  There is no tapering of this measure.  If the Minister said she was taking away the half rate payment for those earning €800 to €1,000 a week, I would be with her all the way to the bank.  At the very least, she should have provided for tapering.  We are experts at clinics and will warn people that whatever they do, they should not go above the figure of €400 if they cannot jump to approximately €600 or €700.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, who is sensible will know exactly what to tell his constituents this weekend.  He will tell them not to earn money if they cannot move from €300 to €700.  This measure should be tapered.  Will the Minister reconsider the issue and come back with an amendment next week?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	786	Does the Minister accept that at the heart of this dilemma of drawing a line in respect of entitlement is the fact that for many years we failed to develop an integrated tax and social welfare system?  That is one of the reasons, on which I do not wish to dwell, we are in this financial difficulty.  However, a bigger failing of previous Administrations of all hues was that they failed to develop an integrated tax and social welfare system which would have allowed us to deliver resources in a more targeted way, especially at a time when resources were scarce.  It is that failure which leaves us with little or no option but to endeavour to make savings.  I accept the point being made that when one draws a line, one may fall off the cliff.  However, if we had an integrated tax and social welfare system, under which there would be a more progressive wind-down of entitlement, we would not face these difficult choices.  While I accept the necessity to make the changes and cuts proposed, will the Minister give a commitment that this time next year when we will again be looking at tax and social welfare issues, there will be the capacity to adopt a more progressive approach in targeting resources where they are most needed?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	787	The fact that Fianna Fáil sold out the country to the troika, bankrupted it and did equally disgusting things in the last budget does not in any way justify the Government's actions in continuing the same policies.  We will not reach and properly scrutinise other sections of the Bill because the Government is ramming the legislation through.  This is the most important Bill the Government has introduced since it took office because it is tangible, concrete and will affect huge numbers of ordinary families, yet it is being rammed through.  We spent days talking about stuff which, frankly, was of marginal importance to the majority of people, yet when it comes to something which matters to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of low and middle income families, lone parents, the elderly and children, legislation is rammed through and we are not given a chance to discuss it.  The income disregard, the qualified child increase and the transitional payment will hit people struggling out of poverty traps if they exceed certain earnings.  Is there an easier and fairer way to do this that would address the question of high income earners?  The Minister for Finance could do it.  If the Government taxed incomes of more than €100,000 at a higher level it would not need to hit struggling families.  The Minister for Social Protection could have done something via this Bill.  Why not increase PRSI on earnings of more than €100,000?

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	790	The Minister should increase it further instead of hitting people at the bottom.  We would not have these anomalies then.  However, the Government has resolutely refused to impose higher taxes on those who can afford them.  If people at the bottom are hit, it will create more poverty and cost society more.  It will not just cost the Labour Party many seats at the next election, or cause people anger and anguish.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I agree with Deputy Creed.  A key issue with the interaction between the taxation and social welfare systems is that the two sets of computers do not speak to each other.  The basis on which income tax is calculated and the household is identified differs greatly from the way in which the household is described for social welfare purposes.One way to address this problem is to move to a system of tax credits, particularly as they relate to benefits that affect children.  This would achieve the purposes to which Deputy Ó Cuív referred.  Shortly after becoming Minister, I appointed an expert advisory group to consider the integration of tax and social welfare with specific reference to the question of how families and children are supported.  As Deputy Creed knows, targeting such supports has been discussed for more than 20 years.  Fr. Seán Healy has written a great deal on the subject.We will need greater IT compatibility between the Department of Social Protection and Revenue as well as changes to the fundamental rules defining income earners, family units etc.  Given that Ireland has different kinds of families, I agree with Deputy Creed's points.I do not agree with Deputy Ó Cuív when he suggested that Fianna Fáil wants to cut what pensioners receive.  Doing so would be wrong.  In the budget, I have tried to ensure that basic contributory and non-contributory pensions are maintained.  Pensioners need as much certainty about their incomes as possible.  Deputy Ó Cuív was the Minister before me and he may have had ideas about cutting pensions for what he described as wealthy pensioners.  Most pensioners are not particularly wealthy.  The contributory pension is based on people's contributions.  Maintaining the basic rates of contributory and non-contributory old age pensions in so far as we can is an important objective of the Government.

Will the Minister confirm that only 50% of social welfare recipients get the full, primary rate?  According to the Department, this is a fact.Much of the Minister's response referred to how great it was that the primary social welfare rates were untouched.  I agree with her and have no problem saying well done.  Instead of doing as we suggested and leaving every aspect of the social welfare code untouched except where a tightening up of the system was required to address major problems, the Minister went after secondary rates, including the likes of the qualified child increase, fuel allowance, back to school allowance, rent supplement etc.  These were introduced to address identified poverty traps because people could not afford to live on the primary rates.  While I welcome that primary rates have not been affected, by cutting the amount that people get through secondary benefits, the Government is targeting the most vulnerable and those who depend on social welfare rates.We would all love if secondary rates were not necessary because primary rates captured everything.  I discussed working towards this objective with Deputy Ó Cuív last year and have since discussed it with departmental officials, but it is a long way off.  If the Government keeps slashing secondary benefits, which were set up to help those living in misery, it will be taking a dangerous route.  The majority of the people in question have families and it is usually children who suffer the most.We can blame Fianna Fáil, the troika and everyone else, but there are alternative proposals to capture moneys from wealthy members of society.  There are many such people, including those who receive considerable amounts of money from the Exchequer, for example, consultants.  Although moves have been made previously, the Government could have legislated to reduce consultants' remuneration to €150,000 per year, thereby saving €100 million or €120 million.  I cannot remember the exact figure.  A number of steps could have been taken before the Government even considered taking money out of the pockets of social welfare recipients.  I have warned of the consequences in terms of jobs.As we have limited time, I will not prolong the debate on this matter.  We are not on a proper Committee Stage where we could tease it out fully.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	798	If a spouse in a family earns €400 per week, the annual total is €20,800.  A person in receipt of jobseeker's allowance earns approximately €9,776, leading to a combined income of €30,576.  If that person has two children, he or she would receive €34,000 or more.  That is a tight amount of money, particularly for someone with two children, but we had to draw the line somewhere and this is where we chose to draw it.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	800	This is a different section.  The qualifying condition for the State pension contributory and State pension transition increases from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions and comes into effect in April 2012.  This was legislated for in 1997.  I am introducing a saving clause into the legislation to ensure existing pensioners currently in receipt of the State pension who have less than 520 paid contributions, because they were not required to have them, will not have their pensions touched.  Does that make sense?I am advised on legal grounds that the new condition for the pension is 520 contributions.  This was legislated for 15 years ago and the legal advice is that existing pensioners who would have gained their pension under the 260 contributions until next April could face a legal challenge to their continuing entitlement to a pension because they did not have 520 contributions.  This section was inserted following advice by the Attorney General to ensure all existing pensioners maintain their pensions.  I hope the Deputy will support that.

In page 8, before section 6, to insert the following new section:6.—(1) Section 125 of the Principal Act is amended—(a) in subsection (1) (amended by section 17 of the Act of 2010) by substituting the following paragraph for paragraph (a):"(a) that the widow, widower or surviving civil partner has qualifying contributions in respect of not less than 260 contribution weeks in the period beginning with his or her entry into insurance and ending immediately before the relevant time, and”,and(b) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (1):"(1A) Where the date of death occurs before 5 July 2013, subsection (1)(a) shall be read as if ‘156’ were substituted for ‘260’.”.(2) This section comes into operation on 5 July 2013.".This is to provide for an increase in the number of qualifying contributions required by the surviving spouse or civil partner, or the deceased spouse or civil partner where appropriate, from 156 to 260 during the period from July 2012 to 27 December 2013 to qualify for a survivor's pension.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	812	I wish we had enough time to debate this properly.  This means people must work much longer in this category to qualify for the contributory pension.  If they do not have sufficient years paid in contributions, they must rely on the State non-contributory pension, a lesser pension that is means tested.  That is an attack on a particular group and the pension entitlements they might have reasonably hoped to have.  Was it not one of the justifications for not inflicting far more deserved cuts in the pensions of politicians and Ministers and former taoisigh, who walked off with massive pensions of €145,000, that we had to be careful because they had a reasonable expectation they would have these pensions while they were working?  Would this category of people not have a reasonable expectation that they would qualify for the contributory pension, which is a better pension that is not means tested?  It is another nasty cut at a group who should not be cut.

That means anyone at this stage must ensure they can work an extra two years or find another two years.  There is no lead in.

However, for people who are at that age it is still difficult to find an extra two years to make up the contributions required whereas if the Minister allowed a longer lead-in time it might be more appropriate and there might be an opportunity.  I am opposed to the change anyway, but I am just saying that it if it was 2015 or 2016, it would give extra time and people might find some mechanism to get the additional contribution or credits that they could then qualify for the contributory pension.

I also have a issue with the phasing.  I understand it will be extended by two years.  However, the people who find they need to work the extra years are at the end of a projected working life.  They now need to go back to employers and ask to be kept in employment for the next two years, which will be a potential problem.I also have an issue with the entire concept of these contributions.  It takes no account of the amount of money people are contributing through PRSI and their tax.  It is based on an archaic stamp system, which is from an old world where people went into jobs for life.  We will have a major problem with, in particular, people in negative equity who will not have a huge amount and will be relying on these.

Becoming a widow or widower normally happens as an unforeseen event.  This provision mainly affects young widows and widowers.  I welcome the reduction from ten years to five years in the amendment.  If a person's spouse dies before he or she has five years — it used to be three years — of contributions, there is no contributory pension.  It affects the very sad cases of young widows — taking widows in the generic sense — but statistically it affects more women than men.  For what I regard as a very niggly cut affecting a very small number of people, how much money will the measure as amended save the Department in a full year?

In terms of the demographics, people might know that three years' contribution for a widow's or widower's pension is a very small number of contributions and is one of the reasons our social insurance fund is in such deficit.  The number of contributions for other people for the contributory old age pension was defined back in 1997 to go up to 520 contributions.

It was because we have a social insurance fund that is in deficit to a huge degree.  We might all like not to require any contributions for a contributory pension.  However, some contributions are required to keep the fund in some sort of balance with generation of income.  We are having a much lower level of contributions for a widow's pension.

If somebody with little or no income, who does not have three years' contribution, becomes widowed, without any contributions, he or she gets the non-contributory widow's pension.  The current arrangements will apply in future also.  If somebody suddenly becomes widowed early in life without time to build up contributions and is not well off, he or she will qualify on a means-tested basis for a non-contributory widow's or widower's pension.  Even someone in his or her early 20s will get that until he or she goes onto the old age pension or until he or she chooses to remarry.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	876	The statistics I have here indicate that the average weekly recipients who we expect would be affected in 2012 is zero; in 2013, zero; in 2014, approximately 700; and in 2015, approximately 1,400.  Therefore the savings, if any, would only arise after 2014 and they would amount to less than €2 million in that year.  Deputy Ó Cuív chose to retain legislation where the number of contributions required for the contributory old age pension would rise this year.  That legislation was enacted as long ago as 1997.  Comparative legislation was to have been introduced in respect of widows.  I have ensured that it will come in.  There are few jurisdictions in which one can receive a widow's, widower's or civil partner's pension with three years' contributions, soon to be five years.  In respect of the alleviation of poverty, about which Deputy Donnelly is rightly concerned, survivor's pension for a widow, widower or civil partner is a means-tested payment and continues unchanged.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	889	The cuts to the one-parent allowance impact particularly on mothers.  They severely penalise those recipients who make the effort to upskill or join community employment schemes.  The Government is sending the message to one-parent families that upskilling to try to get into the workplace is to be discouraged.  More than 90% of the recipients of the one-parent family payment are women.  These changes are being made through the backdoor and will severely impact on women reliant on this payment.  One-parent families are at greater risk of poverty than most other families.  One is 4.5 times more likely to live in poverty if one is part of a one-parent family.  There must be sufficient support for these vulnerable mothers.  The change to the income criteria, the penalisation of recipients who make an effort to upskill or join community employment schemes and the dramatic halving of the age eligibility limits his these recipients severely.  This flies in the face of the mantra that there have been no cuts to social welfare rates.  Make no mistake about it, this is a severe cut to the rates for one-parent families.  Those who make an effort to upskill and engage in community employment schemes are to be penalised by virtue of this proposal.  Fianna Fáil vehemently opposes this section.  It can have no hand, act or part in supporting it.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	890	This measure is illogical, bearing in mind what the Minister and the Government said about dealing with poverty traps and activation measures.  The Minister and her officials have identified one-parent families as a group in society which needs to be supported, in particular, in the transition from unemployment to full employment, given the additional costs incurred such as child care and so on.  As I stated, the secondary payment which continues for a period of up to six months where a claimant's earnings do not exceed €425 is a valuable tool in assisting those making the transition from dependance on social welfare to full employment.  This is a strange cut and not much money will be saved.  Given that there are no jobs available, not many will be making the transition for some time.  It is to be hoped some will manage to do so and exceed the figure of €425 allowed.  It is to be hoped some will gain employment to put bread on the table and pay all their bills.The Minister is penalising families which are struggling.  Some 65% of the country's poorest children are living in one-parent families.  Every lone parent I know wants to work, which is to be welcomed.  The transition payment was a mechanism to assist and encouraged such parents, but now they are being hammered again.  This is a disincentive and a retrograde step that should, as suggested by the Minister, be withdrawn, even though she was thinking of the next section.  If anything, this mechanism should be extended to other social welfare recipients to assist them in making the transition from dependance on social welfare to full employment, given that more people will become dependant on long-term social welfare assistance, which will cause difficulties in terms of expenditure, particularly for those who previously were able to take care of their children and now have to pay to have them cared for.  This is akin to a person being entitled to retain his or her medical card following the move from welfare dependancy.  Is that, too, likely to be withdrawn?  I urge the Minister to do what she said she would do at the commencement of the discussion on this section, namely, withdraw it.

Earlier, when I joined the protesters outside the gates, I met a young woman who told me she had been looking forward to returning to work in January until she worked out the figures and discovered she would only gain €20 extra in so doing.  The Minister is forcing lifestyle choices on women, who in the main are the parent in one-parent families, as to whether they should go back to work.  This proposal should be reversed and the Minister should stand outside with the people who elected her to defend them.  She is forcing a lifestyle choice on women.  Shame on her.  Members of her party should vote against the Bill, in particular the proposed cut to one-parent family allowance.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I fail to understand the strategy being pursued, given that the Minister has stated her objective is to get lone parents back to work, which is reasonable and correct.  However, there must be support mechanisms in place to allow this to happen.  Therefore, transitional arrangements are important, as there is a limited number of jobs available.  Without child care and transitional payments, returning to work for lone parents is incredibly difficult.  I do not understand how this measure sits side by side with the Minister's philosophy as outlined yesterday.  It appears to me as though it simply is a money-saving exercise rather than a policy position or decision regarding a strategy to get people back to work.
