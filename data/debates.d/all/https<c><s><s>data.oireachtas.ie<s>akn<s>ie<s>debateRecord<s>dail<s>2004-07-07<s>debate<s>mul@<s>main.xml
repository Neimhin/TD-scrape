        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">This is our last opportunity to have the Taoiseach answer questions on Leaders' Questions before the summer recess. I will start by quoting Paul Byrne of Tallaght, who said, "The next time I go to A&amp;E again I'd rather not be breathing." He was the patient who, during a visit to hospital, found that, when he returned from the toilet, his trolley had been taken for another patient. We have had lists of promises and statistics from the Taoiseach and his Ministers over the last few years regarding accident and emergency units. On 7 January 2004 there were 179 patients on trolleys in Dublin accident and emergency units. On 3 February there were 207 patients, on 26 April 160, and on 22 June 150. The figures for summer are almost the same as for winter, despite the fact that €11 billion is being spent on health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">That is not confined to the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, and those situations will be exacerbated by the requirements of the working time directive when it enters force later this year. Similar problems have been experienced in University College Hospital, Galway, in Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar, in the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore, the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick, Naas General Hospital and Wexford General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The Taoiseach has examined the economic situation, which is quite strong. He has said publicly that we have more money to spend, and the Tánaiste has said that we have three years in which to put the boot to the floor. Is the Taoiseach satisfied, and does he agree with me, that the structure that currently applies is not capable of delivering 24-hour accident and emergency services for those who need them when they need them and that it must be radically altered now? Does the Taoiseach intend providing extra moneys this year to deal with the provision of 24-hour accident and emergency cover in hospitals throughout the country for people who need it and currently cannot get it? Will it continue to be the case that, if they go there, they will find themselves lying on trolleys for days on end?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">The Government identified some years ago that health reform and a change to our structures were necessary. We must change our health board system and many other structures in the health system. We have identified that and prepared and produced reports. We have passed the Health (Amendment) Act 2004. We are already trying to put extra resources into different areas of health care. I will not go through the long list of the improvements in staff and everything else. I assume that people who were there are doing a better job.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">It is a fact that there are particular problems in accident and emergency departments. We have identified those problems and tried several ways of alleviating the difficulties. We have far more accident and emergency consultants in the units. We have opened additional beds and tried through various measures to eliminate the problem as far as one can. Deputy Kenny suggested that 24-hour cover is a difficulty. We must find out exactly whether it is a matter of simply having more beds. I do not like the term "bed blockers", but it means that there are people who, owing to the lack of stand-down facilities, cannot go home or get alternative accommodation, instead staying in acute hospitals longer than they normally would.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_12">If that is the case, though we have opened additional beds, we have to try to do more in the area. Accident and emergency departments are clearly the main focus. In all surveys of patients, they say that, by and large, they find the hospital service excellent but the accident and emergency departments fairly disastrous, though not in all areas of the country. That is the challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">It is a question of changing some of the systems. I remember a time not that many years ago when it was not possible to have accident and emergency departments in every hospital. However, it seemed at that time that it was not so difficult in accident and emergency, though that appears a total contradiction. Now we have accident and emergency units everywhere, all well staffed.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_18">That is more or less the same reply that the Taoiseach has given on numerous occasions in the past. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is being strangled by the Department of Finance and the Taoiseach's Government. Today is the Taoiseach's 2,568th day in continuous Government. There have been seven years of plenty and seven years of waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">When the Taoiseach says that he has opened extra facilities, perhaps I should remind him that a €96 million wing of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown remains substantially idle. A brand new health centre costing €48 million in Ballymun has been lying vacant since it was finished 18 months ago, despite the fact that the Northern Area Health Board has paid €5.25 million in rent for the facility. A €26 million high-tech accident and emergency unit has been lying idle in Cork University Hospital for the past seven months. The hospital wing at South Tipperary General in Clonmel has been idle for 15 months. A €2.8 million, 90-bed unit for the elderly in Birr, County Offaly remains unoccupied. Is the Taoiseach not ashamed that he presides over a Government that has failed utterly to deal with a fundamental issue of rights for our people — access to health care when they need it?</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The litany from Minister after Minister reminds me of Edmund Burke's remark that falsehood has a perennial spring. Seven years later the Government continues to spout endless lists of money spent when the evidence is available in every household in the land that this has been the worst Government in 50 years and has failed completely to deal with the nation's health issues. The Taoiseach should be ashamed of himself heading into the summer recess. Shame on him and his Ministers.</p>

Who spoke on the radio this morning on behalf of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Irish Medical Organisation to say that implementation of the Working Time Directive will adversely affect patient care, inevitably lengthen the queues and slow down appointments for elective treatments?</p>
          <p eId="para_47">Who is fooling whom? Is it not the reality that there are new units of hospitals to the value of €416 million, as identified in the Minister's memorandum to Government, boarded up because they cannot be commissioned? Only this morning a newspaper reports a €30 million unit in St. James's Hospital, that would treat 20,000 cancer patients a year, is chained and padlocked. Cancer patients await access to Dublin's largest hospital which is padlocked and chained a year after the unit was provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Deputy Kenny has given the Taoiseach the list of hospitals we visited in Mullingar, Clonmel, Naas, the University Hospital in Cork, Wexford, James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown and several others. Who is the Minister responsible for health? Clearly he is the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who brought in six-monthly returns last week showing a surplus in tax of €1,049 million and an underspend on the budget provision of €609 million. Essential moneys to commission hospitals for patients awaiting treatment for cancer cannot be provided and the Taoiseach says Deputy Kenny is misleading the House and the public. Has the Taoiseach lost all touch with reality? Does he see the embarrassment of his own backbenchers? When will he do something about the chronic state of the health services?</p>

That directive must be implemented by 1 August. There are 700 nurse vacancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">The Taoiseach talks of people blocking beds but there is bed capacity in private nursing homes that cannot be accessed because of their cost. He boasts about his friends in the construction industry building units and new wings of hospitals and says that his Government did all this. His Government has kept them closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">His Minister brought a memo to Cabinet that someone contrived to leak into the public domain showing that €416 million worth of plant is lying idle that cannot be commissioned. Meanwhile his Minister for Finance boasts of how he intends to stay in that Department, no matter what the Taoiseach intends, and he will not provide the basic money for people in need of appointments in our public hospital system.

          <p eId="para_75">They and we know that is not workable. If they engage with the Minister for Health and Children we can resolve this so that from 1 August it will apply to doctors in training. They have long campaigned on the basis they were working too long. We supported that campaign and made significant improvements from the 80 or 90 hours a week they were forced to work. The Working Time Directive requires that doctors work no more than an average of 58 hours in hospital each week, and no more than 13 hours per day and receive daily and weekly rest breaks. We support that. To make it operate effectively, however, there will be an enormous cost to the State, which it is willing to pay. Negotiations must be concluded on how the rosters will work.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">As regards the other issues, I will say no more than I have already said.

          <p eId="para_77">For the third time today and, all too sadly, for the final time for the next ten weeks, the House asks the Taoiseach to indicate the immediate and effective measures he will take during the summer months to address the crisis in the health service. He must accept the facts. The Irish Nurses' Organisation has highlighted the drastic shortage in the number of nurses. There are some 700 vacancies and it is projected that this will increase to in excess of 2,000 within the next 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The crisis continues in accident and emergency departments, particularly those in Dublin with which the Taoiseach should be familiar. My colleague, Councillor Dessie Ellis, informed me about a man from his constituency who spent three days on a trolley in the Mater Hospital's accident and emergency department. On the day the man, who had suffered a stroke, obtained a bed, there were 29 patients on trolleys in the hospital. Some of these individuals had been on trolleys for five days at that juncture.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Yesterday and again today, four women from my constituency, including an expectant mother, are bringing a case before the High Court to challenge the decision to remove maternity services from Monaghan General Hospital. In addition to the closure of these services, accident and emergency services at the hospital have also been withdrawn. The Government has stood idly by and ignored Monaghan. The Taoiseach did not refer to it earlier in the context of the list of issues relating to hospitals that need to be addressed. Citizens are being obliged to resort to the courts in order to secure their basic right to access essential hospital services.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">A report into the death of a nine year old child, Frances Sheridan of Cootehill, Cavan, was published recently. The girl in question was sent home from the accident and emergency department of Cavan General Hospital and the report to which I refer illustrates a litany of errors and system failures which must raise questions about the overall management of our hospital delivery systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_145">Last month the Information Commissioner published a report on the effects of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 and the introduction of fees on the use of freedom of information legislation. Her report echoes what I said to the Taoiseach on numerous occasions in the House. The report stated that usage of the Act had been cut dramatically. She found that overall usage of the Act was down by 50%, with requests for non-personal information cut by 75%. Does the Taoiseach accept that if a person successfully appeals a refusal of access to information, he or she should be reimbursed the fees in respect of the appeal?</p>

            <p eId="para_146">Is the Deputy suggesting we should look at introducing a system of refunds for successful appeals? It is a constructive suggestion that will be looked at.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">On the first part of the question, the fee for making a FOI request is €15. I do not believe that can be considered a major deterrent to a responsible use of the Act. It is modest when set against the cost of administering the service, which when it was calculated some time ago by the Department of Finance, was about €425 per request. I will pass on the Deputy's comment about appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Every time I say this it tends to come across differently outside, I repeat that the service is free for people who wish to seek personal information; they do not pay fees.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_101">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_149">Does the Taoiseach agree with the view of the Information Commissioner when she said: "The decline in usage of the Act has gone far beyond what the Government had intended when it decided to introduce fees"? I do not agree with that because I think that is what the Government intended. I would like to hear the Taoiseach's view on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">I would also like to hear his view on whether it is right that, of the other jurisdictions surveyed, only three imposed a fee for FOI application requests, none charged for internal review and only one, namely, Ontario, charged for an application to the information commissioner's office. That fee was less than half the Irish fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">What is the response of the Taoiseach's Department to the recommendation from the Information Commissioner, given that Ireland is "substantially out of line with practice abroad" on fees for reviews of decisions and so on? She called for a reappraisal of the €150 charge that applied to reviews carried out by her office. Will the Taoiseach indicate if it is the Government's intention to carry out such a reappraisal?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_102">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_152">There is no doubt that the numbers are down; they have been falling since 1999. In the first year of the operation of FOI a total of 207 applications were received in my Department. The numbers peaked in 2001 at 279 applications. When FOI was first introduced, people were looking for information from the past and there was a flood of requests for both personal information and information on other issues. Even before the changes were introduced a year ago the figures were substantially down and they have continued to come down. There is no doubt that it is not being used to the extent that it was.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">Over 66% of requests to my Department were from journalists but since the fee was introduced they have not been using it to the same extent. In the other areas, the number of requests from academics, business and others has not changed significantly. The figure for personal cases is still the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">A study in my Department revealed that less than 10% of cases go for internal review and, from the beginning, only 4% of cases have gone to the Information Commissioner, which is quite a low number.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">As the Deputy knows, the original Act was based on the Canadian model. The United States does not charge anything for FOI requests but according to information available to me, which I do not have to hand, all of the other areas were charging. If the Information Commissioner stated the charge for reviews made to her should be examined, the Department of Finance will do that. It will look at that figure.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_103">
            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_156">What did the Taoiseach mean by saying the Department would "look at" the figure? Did he say FOI requests from journalists had declined by as much as 83% between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004? I take it that is the extent to which he referred when he said, "not to the same extent".</p>
            <p eId="para_157">Does the Taoiseach agree with the Information Commissioner's statement that the Act has gone far beyond what the Government intended when it introduced fees? Others would have their doubts but giving us the benefit of the doubt, does he agree with that statement? Will he indicate in more detail what he meant when he said the Minister for Finance might look at the fees and perhaps introduce some of the recommendations suggested by the Information Commissioner to bring the system more into line with international practice, given that we are out on a limb in this country and open government is not being practised as a result?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_104">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_158">The figures are not down to the extent indicated by Deputy Sargent, although there has been a decline in recent years. The costs are not out of line with what happens in other countries. For a period, the media, business and others were using the Act to a great extent. In other countries that is not the case, it is used by the public. By and large, FOI was introduced for the benefit of the public and it is settling back to that being the case. For some time, the situation was that over two thirds of cases were from journalists but that has reduced substantially. We also had vexatious applications and business interests using the system to obtain information. A small number of them were using it to a considerable extent. The change in fees has stopped that.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">The Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for the Act, will examine closely the report of the Information Commissioner. We have only operated this system for a year. I have no doubt he will take account of and examine what the commissioner has said and ultimately it will be a matter for decision. I believe only the United States has a free system. I have found the note I sought for Deputy Rabbitte a few minutes ago. In Australia, 574 Australian dollars, or €335, applies to an appeal to the administrative tribunal. That is broadly equivalent to an appeal to our Information Commissioner. Statistics suggest that the fees for internal review and review by the Information Commissioner will not be affected and that most users are getting the information they request.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">The Freedom of Information Act was introduced to allow members of the public to be able to get information about themselves freely and easily. The Act works very well in that regard. In some areas information cannot be given. Last night I reviewed the section 20 certificates, which relate to the mandatory exemption of records where the Secretary General of the Department certifies that the deliberative process of the Department is ongoing. While we had considerable debate on that matter when the change was introduced last year, no Freedom of Information Act request has been refused under this or other sections. Some matters before Government would be refused, as was provided for in the original Act. The Act has settled down and will need to be reviewed after a few years.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">The main purpose of the Act was to allow people to get information that the State or agencies of the State held about them and that has happened. While I know this is away from the question, it offers some clarity to point out that, outside Departments, the figures relating to individuals seeking information from local authorities and health boards have not reduced, because they seek information about themselves. We need to leave this for some years and see how it operates.</p>

Does he agree with the Information Commissioner in saying that the scale and structure of the charges should be reviewed because the media represent a key element in an open and properly functioning democracy? Given the 83% decline in journalists' inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act during a five-month period, does the Taoiseach not accept that the fees inhibit journalists and others who scrutinise the workings of Government, the Civil Service, etc. from advancing democracy and accountability?</p>

A fee of €15 for making a request under the Freedom of Information Act cannot be considered a major deterrent to responsible use of the Act. It is a very modest fee. The cost of processing a request is approximately €425 and the fee is a very small fraction of that. The Long Title of the Freedom of Information Act confers a right of access to information to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest. A modest system of charges which strikes an appropriate balance between the public's right to obtain information and the administration of the Freedom of Information Act and all other services must be provided and is in the public interest. The system the Government has introduced does this and it would not be appropriate to change it, notwithstanding any decline in the number of requests being made.</p>

            <p eId="para_164">As was asked, the Taoiseach should inform the House what he regards as the purpose of the freedom of information legislation. He said it was to allow people to obtain information about themselves. Is it not the case that this legislation is designed to make Government more open and transparent, and therefore the workings of Government are to be open to public access? Is the Taoiseach not overlooking that point?</p>

            <p eId="para_168">The Taoiseach seems to think it is only about personal information. Does he not realise it is about more than that? Does he not realise that journalists are also members of the public and may well seek information in the public interest?</p>

            <p eId="para_169">The practice of my Department during the Presidency, which will continue, was to put most reports and documents on the website so that they were available. I accept that, in the past, people had to trawl and ask questions to get such information, but that is not happening now and the information is on the website within half an hour. That is a change in the position. We can see where the world is going. We estimated that 10 million to 15 million hits during the Irish Presidency would indicate good use of the website, but we had 46 million hits. This is how the world seeks information.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">If they are not in the deliberative process of Government, most other reports and information that people might seek are put on the website. More Departments are doing this. The view of my Department's Secretary General and the management advisory committee is that any matter, even one of interest only to a select group, should be made available. There is no great secrecy about most of this information. I accept that used to be the attitude in the past, but it is not the attitude now. This has changed the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">I only made the point about the individuals because the freedom of information is important for them. It represents a major change from the past and was a real breakthrough. I saw how it was being used by some vexatious individuals and business interests. Some businesses, which were established for this purpose, are now gone. They submitted in a substantial number of requests under the Freedom of Information Act at considerable cost to the State. They are out of the system now.</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_113">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_178">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">Progress on the Government programme is kept constantly under review. Deputies will be aware that for every full year of the previous Government's term of office, we published an annual progress report. Last summer, we published the first annual progress report of the current Administration and it is my intention to publish a further report later this year. I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the implementation of An Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">Our programme for Government is both clear in intent and specific in detail. It is the agreed agenda for this partnership Government over five full years. The starting point for the current programme was rooted in a recognition that, in an ever-changing world, the reform process is never over. As a Government, we are determined to keep driving forward. In implementing this programme for Government, we will not rest on past successes. Instead, we will build on the solid foundations we have put in place since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">In setting out to implement our commitments, we will bring forward and progress the most ambitious legislative programme in the history of the State. Since the present Government took office on 6 June 2002 some 90 Bills have been published, 78 have already been enacted into law and 38 are before the Oireachtas. Given the scale of the Government's legislative programme and the large number of specific commitments set out in the agreed programme, it would be impossible in the time allowed to detail fully the amount of progress already delivered. It would be more appropriate for individual Ministers to answer that.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">The cornerstones of An Agreed Programme for Government are based on our desire to build a better Ireland for everyone and our promises to protect and expand prosperity for all, strengthen peace and reconciliation, guarantee improved pensions, reform and develop our health services and invest in better public services. Without economic strength, there will never be an Ireland where everyone can prosper and fulfil their potential. A key objective of our programme for Government is to sustain a strong economy and "keep the finances of general Government close to balance or in surplus". Our prudent management of the economy has meant that Ireland has come through the worst world recession in 20 years stronger than most countries and as good as the best. This was shown again in recent weeks by figures which indicate we have maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe as well as the budgetary figures which show real strength.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">Since 1997, when the Government was first formed by the current parties, there are more people working in Ireland than ever. The policies the Government has implemented have supported the creation of 420,000 extra jobs and positioned us among the top countries in terms of global competitiveness. We have also substantially increased real incomes and introduced major reform of the taxation system. The OECD recently highlighted that workers here now enjoy one of the lowest taxation regimes in the developed world.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">Our overriding priority as set out in the programme for Government is to secure lasting peace in Northern Ireland and we have worked towards it. We will continue to apply our energies in support of the Good Friday Agreement, as it remains the template for political progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">Our other key commitments are to run a proactive EU Presidency and I wish to acknowledge the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. We are committed to addressing Ireland's infrastructural deficit in a coherent way. Capital envelopes totalling €33.6 billion for the period from 2004 to 2008 were introduced in the last budget. The capital envelopes include a commitment to keep the level of Exchequer-funded capital investment at 5% of GNP during the period. The envelopes will allow for an even flow of investment projects, facilitate better value for money and provide greater certainty in tackling the infrastructure deficit. The total capital envelope for roads and public transport projects is €9.4 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">We are committed to implementing a multi-stranded approach to addressing housing needs right across the spectrum, with up-to-date figures showing the success of our policies in increasing housing supply. Now approximately 70,000 houses a year are being built, which is three times the level of ten years ago, three times the EU average and five times the UK average.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">We are committed to encouraging a better spread of jobs throughout the country and people should not forget that the rate of unemployment is among the lowest in the European Union. The 2002 census showed that employment has grown strongly in every county since the last census in 1996. The Government is determined that strong national employment growth will continue to be felt throughout the regions. More than 53,000 new jobs were created last year. Ireland has recently secured major foreign direct investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">We are committed also to bringing forward a programme of fundamental reform of the insurance industry. A comprehensive set of interrelated measures, designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market have been brought forward by the Tánaiste. We are committed to rural development, in particular the widening of the CLÁR boundaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">We are committed to the implementation of the penalty points system, which has had an impact on road safety. The penalty points system has been operating since October 2002 for the offence of breaching a speed limit; from 1 June 2003 for insurance offences; and from 25 August 2003 for seatbelt wearing offences. The system was recently extended to include the offence of careless driving with effect from 4 June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">We are committed to putting in place open access broadband on a national basis. The 19 town metropolitan area network broadband programme is on time and on target. A radical €140 million broadband action plan was launched in December. This extends the current programme of local authority infrastructure to 19 regional towns with the aim of bringing low-cost broadband to every Irish town with a population of more than 1,500 people. The other schemes will be set out in the booklet of actions, which will be delivered shortly.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_114">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_191">I am nearly unable to ask a question after that response from the Taoiseach. May I make a number of observations before I ask two specific questions?</p>
            <p eId="para_192">I looked at the programme for Government recently and the following are relevant extracts from it. The Government promised to keep down personal and business taxes, but 27 stealth taxes have been introduced since then. It promised to ensure that 80% of all earners would pay tax only at the standard rate, however, 52% now pay at the top rate as the tax bands have not been widened. It promised to support the positive role of the community employment schemes to meet the needs of both the long-term unemployed and communities, but 4,500 jobs have been cut in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">The programme also stated the Government will give a fresh impetus to the important role of small business in Ireland to ensure that their interests are taken into account in formulating and implementing policies that impact on the enterprise centre. ISME has warned that 35,000 jobs in small firms are in danger because owners perceive the Government as being a regulator rather than a facilitator of small businesses. The programme further states that it will seek to resolve potential issues, difficulties and conflicts in the spirit of social partnership, but now companies such as Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, CIE and the ESB are facing strike action.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">How can the physical renewal of third level campuses, which has been referred to in the programme for Government, take place when cuts of more than 40% have been made in the capital allocations to third level colleges and universities last year?</p>
            <p eId="para_195">The programme for Government makes a commitment to progressively develop adult education services. Does the Taoiseach accept that the actions of the Government in capping places at colleges of further education and PLC courses and in cutting back on child care funding for those who want to do such courses, has undermined educational opportunities to the detriment of thousands of people?</p>
            <p eId="para_196">Did the Taoiseach state that he would expect each Minister to produce a progress report on his or her Department or are we to have a revised copy of the programme for Government on what has been achieved and what will be achieved in the coming period?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_115">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_197">In response to Deputy Kenny's final question, the programme we publish every year is a review of actions against the programme. We normally publish it at this time, but as the staff were working on the EU Presidency, it will be published during the summer and I hope to have it out as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">On the question of the universities, during the past number of years the Government has been able to facilitate significant capital programmes. However, that was cut back in 2002 and 2003. We have to finish the drive whereby every third level institution had a major capital programme. The benefit of that programme has been an additional 25,000 places for students. The universities have now come forward with new plans and I am due to meet the presidents of the universities in the next few days, if not today, to discuss these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">The former Ministers for Education, Deputies Martin and Woods, and the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, have been involved in the adult education programme and in building up NALA and other organisations and PLC courses. There has been some tightening of the finances in that area, as there was everywhere when revenues were not strong.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">Infrastructure has been built up in adult education and I support that. I recently attended a seminar in the Gresham Hotel of all the national groups working in this area. Obviously the groups are concerned that the Government will continue to develop the programmes in the future, but there is a sense of satisfaction that we have built them up to this level and that we have provided some increases. We have to continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">I agree with the Deputy that PLC courses are very important to a certain section of society who were not able to access education because of disadvantage. That is why the then Minister for Education, Deputy Martin, put so much effort and resources into that service in 1997 and the Government will continue to do that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_116">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_202">I could ask the Taoiseach a great many specific questions. We could go down through the waiting lists, which the Taoiseach promised to abolish in two years; the promise made to recruit an additional 2,000 gardaí; the 200,000 medical cards; the 10,000 affordable houses and so on. On the question of PLC courses, which Deputy Kenny raised, I visited a school during the local election campaign where five teachers are being let go because of cuts in the PLC allocation. I think the school is in Templemichael, County Longford. Tremendous work has been done in this school which has more students on PLC courses than in the traditional leaving certificate cohort. The five teachers are being let go because the figures are capped.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RoryOHanlon" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_117">
            <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
            <p eId="para_203">Does the Deputy have a question?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_118">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_204">This is a question, Sir. I am asking the Taoiseach if he knows about that case because an intervention would be greatly appreciated.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">Is there any sign of a loosening of the purse strings for chronic and acute need on the social side? If taxes are in excess of €1 billion over what was guesstimated by the Minister and if the underspend so far is €609 million, it is surely possible to address some of the more chronic under-provisions in social services. One could go through them all but there is no need. The PLC one that Deputy Kenny mentioned accidentally or I accidentally pick up on is just an example. A health centre in Millbrook Lawns in my constituency was burned down five years ago. Nine rooms were destroyed by vandals five years ago and after all this time, even though the cost is €1 million, it has not been reconstructed. This centre served a large populous area with an entire range of social services, nursing, pre-natal and ante-natal care etc., yet it cannot be rebuilt. The Taoiseach must have heard this argument at his parliamentary party, and I am asking him to tell the House and the public whether we are likely to see some of these more chronic deficiencies addressed in the next six months or so.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_119">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_206">I am not aware of the individual areas. However, I would like to make two points about the figures. Obviously, all the under-allocations can be spent. One sees this in the final quarter of every year where there tends to be underspending. The Minister for Finance, to his credit, is always urging people to have a more even spread of the profile of their figures. We all know how that system operates and now with monthly accounting it is far more effective than it used to be. There are many areas within individual Departments where programmes can be funded within the Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">While the revenue position is better this year, of course it allows some leeway in the Estimates process and in the figures for this year. I mentioned this morning some of the areas in regard to health and education. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has been able to put in resources to assist with bed shortages, for example, in funding health boards across the country to alleviate the pressure on beds. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area alone, there are about 300 extra beds. In the education area, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, has recently been able to appoint a net 350 extra resource teachers and there have been increases in other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">In the Estimates process for next year, obviously the baseline figure can improve. The Minister for Finance did not make cutbacks in the past few years. He reduced expenditure from the high levels that were possible — expenditure had increased by over 20%, which was strongly condemned in this House — to norms of 6% that were sustainable in a tighter economy. Now the economy is growing again and this allows for buoyancy and more money to be put into particular areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">When somebody mentions, as Deputy Rabbitte has done, individual cases such as a health board building that was burnt down five years ago without being reconstructed, I am not in the business of defending that. I can never understand, given the allocations and the individual Estimates for some of these areas and where money is spent, why necessary facilities are not provided in deprived areas. I will not try to defend that. I witness similar occurrence at times in my constituency, and I will raise the case of the centre in Millbrook Lawns, as the Deputy has made the point.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_120">
            <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_210">I have two specific questions on areas of infrastructural investment. Will the Taoiseach first clear up the confusion that occurred last week when he appeared to indicate that the whole metro project for Dublin was being scuppered? Perhaps he intended to say that parts other than the Dublin metro line would not go ahead. Will he confirm that this is the case? If it is the case, will he ask the Dublin Transportation Office to review the overall transport profile for Dublin, given that all the other metro lines are not to be proceeded with? Will he confirm when the Government will finally make a decision on this? We have heard over the past year that it would be made "within weeks".</p>
            <p eId="para_211">How does the Taoiseach answer criticism from certain people in the telecommunications sector about the State spending up to €170 million on the unnecessary laying of new fibre optic cables for broadband metropolitan area networks? While the investment is welcome, how does the Taoiseach answer the criticisms of people in the sector that duplicating existing fibre optic cables in the ground amounts to a massive waste of money and that some of the existing cables could be used in our metropolitan area networks rather than spending excessive funds laying a second fibre optic cable alongside existing installations?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_121">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_212">I will take the second question first. The point has been made at the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure, which I chair, that we should be using the best services, whether on rail lines or whatever. We should be getting the best value for money rather than duplicating the system. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has been endeavouring to get the telecommunications companies to co-ordinate their efforts with his Department and the agencies so that we are not getting into a competitive position involving unnecessary duplication. Both State and private sector companies should have a vested interest in providing the network to businesses and citizens throughout the country rather than duplicating effort in competition with each other. I do not disagree with what the Deputy has said, but I reassure him as regards what the Minister has been doing and his intervention has worked in some areas.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_216">He has been trying to stop that so that we get best value for money. While I have mentioned the broadband lines, it is a costly system. We should not be in duplication, but should be using the best efforts of the State companies and those with licences in telecommunications companies to work together and co-operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">On the first question, we have no plan to change the Dublin Transportation Office study. As regards the proposals for the metro, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, is in discussion with the Government and the Department of Finance on the plans. The point I made last week was that the overall plan of the metro, as it is envisaged for Dublin, even as amended, is enormously costly. Obviously the DART and airport lines must be linked up, and the plan was to link the line to Swords. I am not sure what the latest costs are, but even that project is enormously costly and the Minister is looking at how to deal with that. If the whole line is to be extended into the entire Dublin area one is talking about billions of euro, which would account for the entire capital programme of the country. While one hears about and reads fancy plans about how the private sector can do all these things and take over the contract, I assure the Deputy that it never works out.</p>

It is great to come up with plans and state, for instance, that a project will cost €15 billion in a short period of time. However, the money needed for the entire plan is not there. The Minister is looking at priority areas and this does not mean changing the existing Dublin Transportation Office study. I do not see any reason to change it, but we must try to implement the main part of it. The main part of it is obvious because there is no light rail, DART or Luas to the airport. That issue has to be addressed as the Dublin Transportation Office study has highlighted.</p>

Does the Taoiseach accept that the achievement of this priority has been obstructed by the continuing delays and the British Government's suspension of the institutions? In the programme, the Government also pledges support for "full public enquiries into the murders of Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill and Rosemary Nelson". Does the Taoiseach accept that the inquiries have been obstructed by the British Government's delays? Is it not time for the Taoiseach to take a much more determined stand on these issues in his dealings with Tony Blair and the British Government?</p>

Is the Government considering the establishment of a national broadband backbone by bringing together Iarnród Éireann, the ESB, Bord Gáis and the metropolitan area networks? Such a State-controlled broadband network would be accessible to new companies entering the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">In light of the Taoiseach's comments that there may be an extra 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area within 20 years, are there plans to pursue a co-ordinated approach to land use and transportation in the Dublin area in line with the Government's commitment?</p>

            <p eId="para_227">I will respond to Deputy Naughten's questions first. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has been trying to co-ordinate the broadband effort. He has had some success in that regard by trying to get the private telecommunications companies and the State agencies to co-operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">No decision has been made in respect of the Garda traffic corps. The proposal, which has some merit, has not been agreed on by everybody. Many have argued about the practicalities of the matter. I still believe that such a service would be much more efficient and cheaper than having fully trained gardaí all the time. I quickly add that there is no wholehearted support for the proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">The report of the Department of the Environment. Heritage and Local Government's Dublin transportation study has been published, as has the national spatial strategy. Studies of the configuration of how things will develop over the next 30 years are in place. The reports have been fully taken into account, from an infrastructural point of view, in the Government's plan for the capital programme between 2004 and 2008. Obviously, that will have to be reflected in the areas we have just been discussing. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has reminded the House that the regional planning guidelines are in place under the spatial strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">In response to Deputy Ferris, we are committed to trying to work to achieve lasting peace. We must make progress. We are committed to inquiries into the Finucane, Hamill and Wright cases. We will continue to hold the British Government to account on what was agreed at Weston Park. We are committed to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">Regarding the other areas, while it is possible to get the institutions up and running, Deputy Ferris is aware that we need progress on all the areas if that is to be achieved. We need to restart the institutions and we must deal with the decommissioning of arms and the policing issue. We must be certain that if we establish the institutions, they will be sustained rather than being set up and brought down, which has been the case. All of these decisions must be taken collectively. The process is continuing. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, had meetings yesterday and I will have meetings today. We will continue to co-operate to see if we can make an effort in this regard in September. We need everybody to play a role in doing that.</p>

Whatever about losing sleep, it is important that we should not lose Dáil time unnecessarily.

Second, paragraph 5 of the explanatory document states that any presidential election, if held, would take place in October and the election period would commence before the Houses resume after the summer recess. The approval, therefore, must be obtained before the summer recess.

          <p eId="para_282">It is proposed to pass this item on the nod without even referral to committee, not to mention the House. It is proposed that we set a spending limit for the presidential election of €1.3 million. With the greatest respect, Sir, that warrants some discussion and it should not be nodded through in this fashion. As I understand it, the €1.3 million is computed on the basis of an aggregate of the spend for the Dáil constituencies. Incidentally, the figure for the Dáil constituencies is not the figure in the 1997 Act but includes the 50% increase the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, ushered in just before the 2002 general election. A €1.3 million spend and a threshold for recoupment that most of the candidates in the last general election would not have attained is almost as appalling a vista as going down to the Four Courts to effect one's rights as a citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The notion of nodding through this item without discussion and without referral even to a committee is very unusual and introducing it here on the penultimate day of the session is less than respectful to the House and to the Opposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">I appreciated getting the telephone call from the Minister this morning but whoever advised him that he had to rush this measure through the House was remiss in not advising him that he should have had spending limits for local elections also. I wonder why they did not advise him accordingly. In this case, however, a huge amount of money is being aggregated without recognition of the economy of scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">This is not the same as running a number of candidates in different constituencies. Running a presidential candidate is completely different and I ask that we would debate this matter either in committee but preferably in the Dáil. It is an area that applies to us all and as representatives of the people we should discuss what is a considerable spending limit.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">The Attorney General advised that we have to do it this way also. Under the legislation a limit has to be set. The Electoral Act 1997 provides for expenditure limits for presidential elections in the same manner as Dáil elections. It is directly linked. Where limits are proposed to be introduced, the Minister is required to lay a draft order before each House of the Oireachtas for positive resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">In setting the expenditure limits, the Act requires the Minister to have regard, as Deputy Rabbitte said, to the limits for the Dáil as set out under the Act. The current expenditure limits for Dáil and European elections are set out for three, four and five seat constituencies. The approval of both Houses of the draft order is required because if a presidential election was held it would take place in October. The election period would commence before the Houses resume after the summer recess, and the approval needs to be obtained before the summer recess. That is the precautionary reason for it.</p>

I do not wish to hold up the Bill. However, I am concerned that, in the unseemly haste in getting the Bill through the House, we may end up with bad law.

The Bill is another typical Deputy McDowell special. It is a hybrid Bill, initially introduced for dealing with civil liability and personal injuries matters. The Minister then grafted on the appointment of eight extra judges — three to the High Court and Circuit Court, respectively, and two to the District Court — with no opportunity for discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Major changes to the <i>in camera</i> rule for family law, domestic violence and rape cases have also been introduced. For the first time yesterday on Committee Stage, Members saw the raft of major amendments that the Minister was introducing. However, he did not have the amendments for the <i>in camera</i> rule. These will be introduced on Report Stage while Members still have to receive and study them.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">There is a real danger that bad legislation will emanate from this procedure.

          <p eId="para_324">The Minister also presented draft amendments that he might possibly introduce to the Bill. While the amendments were discussed on Committee Stage, the Minister was withdrawing amendments to resubmit them on Report Stage. The Minister did not know what he was doing on Committee Stage. There are a substantial number of amendments. The House will not get through the amendments on Report Stage in the short time that is now available which the Ceann Comhairle has already managed to reduce by 15 minutes.

Is there awareness in Government of the need to consolidate legislation that pertains to employers? There is now so much regulation that many employers find they must search for much of the information they need.

          <p eId="para_514">This amendment is opposed. The 1988 maritime security convention, to which the Bill gives effect, specifically excludes warships and any ship owned or operated by a state when used as a naval auxiliary or for customs or police purposes from its scope as it is concerned with the protection of commercial shipping, including Government-owned commercial vessels and non-commercial vessels not in state ownership. The Bill, which is strictly confined to implementing the 1988 convention and the 1988 protocol thereto also contains a definition of "ship" in section 1 which mirrors Article 2.1 of the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The convention is an international instrument, signed and ratified by a large number of states, and to ensure consistency in the application of the regime put in place by the convention in international law, it is essential to keep implementation within the agreed framework. The provisions in the Bill and in the convention apply not only to Irish ships but also to ships of other nationalities. It is essential to maintain consistency between Irish and international law. That is not to say there are no statutory provisions that penalise unlawful acts against Irish State-owned or operated naval, customs or police ships. The Criminal Justice Acts, for example, and the Criminal Damage Act 1991 already contain such provisions. Any offence involving acts on an Irish ship, whether in private or State ownership, anywhere in the world is within Irish jurisdiction and an offence is covered by Irish law.</p>

Were it not for the trade union movement upholding the rights and protections of workers, the conditions under which they would have had to work and live and the threatening abuse by unscrupulous individuals employed in the oil industry would have amounted to Irish workers being treated as cattle.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I worked on the <i>Ocean Ranger</i> which was the largest oil platform in the world at the time. She was built primarily for what a person from Louisiana who was assistant rig manager at the time termed “niggers”. That is the word that was used by the person who held the most senior position on the rig at that time. In the accommodation area, which was underneath the platform floor just above the sea, there was a speaker in every single sleeping accommodation from which people could hear an announcement every 15 minutes of the weight and velocity of the mud. This made it impossible for anybody to sleep. When I was on that rig we organised under the Irish Transport and General Workers’ Union, now SIPTU, and took on the management. The management threatened to run us off the rig and stated it had an arsenal at its disposal with which to do this. Fortunately, the strength of workers organised in a trade union movement, with the support of the trade union movement on land in Dublin acting in our interests, was able to prevent that rig management from doing what it wanted to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Oil companies and rig management have won out in Irish waters because nobody working on Irish rigs off the Irish coast during recent years has union recognition. This is the result of a deal negotiated with the oil companies. They were not taking on Irish labour. For Irish people to work on the rigs on Irish waters, they had first to go and work on the North Sea or elsewhere and come in through the back door. They were also required to give an undertaking not to be part of a union. That is a possibility for which this section allows. Effectively, it will be deemed unlawful in the eyes of management for workers to organise themselves on a rig. If workers take a militant approach and attempt to close down the rig, that will be deemed a navigational hazard placing the safety of the rig in jeopardy. Under this section, anybody who places the safety of a rig in jeopardy can be convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I have asked at all stages that an amendment be made to protect the rights of workers working on fixed platforms or on ships to organise in the interests of workers. The fact that this is not included leaves the legislation wide open to interpretation by an individual who can determine what is lawful and what is unlawful on board a rig or ship, or what is a navigational safety factor on any rig or vessel. The legislation will be wide open to abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">We need only look back to what happened in 1913 when William Martin Murphy tried to destroy the unions and people who went onto the streets were beaten off the streets and imprisoned. This is the same type of legislation. It will undermine the rights of workers. A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and strengthen the Bill in the interests of workers everywhere.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_525">I support the amendment. There has been concern from the outset about the Bill within the trade union movement and particularly within the International Transport Workers' Federation. Workers, trade union leaders, and shop stewards who work in this difficult area have long experience of legislation, passed for the best of purposes, being used viciously against workers in the context of fundamental and basic issues of pay and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions submitted a number of concerns to me in late May. They related mainly to the apparent lack of protection for seafarers and other workers engaged in trade union activities and industrial action. He suggested that perhaps the Attorney General was not sufficiently forthcoming in advising the Minister as to the apparent dangers. That is why the general secretary, Mr. Begg, believes the Bill needs to be amended to insure against any possibility that current rights, immunities and protections afforded to seafarers, workers and trade union officials could be undermined. Of particular concern are the rights of workers on fixed platforms in the oil and gas industry. This is an industry which is and will be of interest and concern to Ireland in future decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">This amendment, and a further amendment in the name of Deputy Ferris, seeks to remove the remit of this Bill from the industrial relations mechanisms of the State. The offences are set out in detail in section 2. They include seizing or exercising control over a ship or fixed platform by force or threat of force, performing an act of violence against a person on board a ship or fixed platform, destroying a ship, causing damage to a ship or fixed platform, placing or causing to be placed any device or substance which could destroy the ship or fixed platform, destroying or seriously damaging maritime navigational facilities, endangering the safe navigation of a ship by communication of information which the person knows to be false, or injuring or killing any person with aim of compelling person to do or not to do something. These are serious crimes and are certainly worthy of the most severe punishment. However, the history of the maritime industry is such that there are genuine concerns that this could in future be used against a group of men and women engaged in a lawful and peaceful form of protest in pursuit of improved conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">This is linked to an issue I have raised throughout debates in this House on these matters, namely, flags of convenience and the administration of international maritime economic conditions. Approximately 48% of new vessels operate under flags of convenience. We can take it for granted that the conditions and wages of seafarers will be under severe pressure. That is why, with the doubling of our register in recent months, I have asked the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to monitor the situation closely to ensure that Ireland is in no way associated with vessels which fly the tricolour and treat workers disgracefully or intimidate them. Given what we know of the existence of this, and I have much literature from my trade union colleagues, Mr. Tony Ayton and others, regarding the operation of flag of convenience vessels and fixed platforms, the concerns are genuine. This amendment would be an important saving grace to ensure that this legislation is not at some stage used against a genuine appeal for better conditions by a workforce, particularly on a fixed platform. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_529">I also ask the Minister to support the amendment. I will not repeat what Deputies Ferris and Broughan have said, but the protection of workers' rights on fixed platforms is of the utmost importance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_293" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_530">I have carefully considered the concerns the Deputies raised in the select committee, as well as those of the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Mr. Tony Ayton, from whom I received correspondence. Having taken further legal advice on the matter, I confirm that no refinement of the Bill is necessary in that regard. As already explained, the only activities falling within the scope of the Bill are very serious criminal offences involving a threat or likelihood of personal injury, death, damage or the destruction of property. Any modification of the application of the convention or protocol in question would not be acceptable to the other contracting states, of which there are already 70. Any employer or other person who attempted to use the law for a purpose not intended would be open to court proceedings for wrongful action. It is the courts which ultimately decide the issue in any individual case.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I fully share the concerns regarding proper conditions applying on ships generally, and I expect that workers' representatives will keep in close touch with the maritime safety directorate of my Department, the European Commission, the International Maritime Organisation and other relevant international bodies with a view to making progress on international measures to that end. On 17 and 30 June I exchanged correspondence with Mr. Tony Ayton. I also corresponded with Mr. David Begg regarding letters sent to me. I referred the correspondence from them to the Attorney General before sending back a comprehensive reply to both. They seemed reasonably satisfied.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I share the views that Mr. Ayton expressed to me, not only in this context, about flags of convenience and improper working conditions. I hope through efforts at international level and our own work during our tenure of the European Presidency we will see changes in that area. There are already signs that flags of convenience are becoming less and less available to irresponsible operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Regarding people working on rigs, last year I met Mr. Dowling of the union, with whom I went through several issues, particularly at the time of the Seven Heads development off Kinsale. There was a view that the company involved should employ Irish people on board, and I understand that has happened to a certain extent. Mr. Dowling has kept in close touch with my Department and is involved in a departmental committee on that area. We have engaged in very strong correspondence. At this stage in the Bill, I see no need for change, particularly given the legal advice we have received.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I beg to differ completely from the legal advice the Minister has been given. It is quite clear from the description of exercising control over a ship or fixed platform using force or the threat of force or by any other form of intimidation, that unscrupulous employers would take a strike as a form of intimidation. The oil industry is well known for such employers, since control is the basis of power. We need only think of events within the past 18 months to see the power of the oil companies and what is done in their interest, not merely nationally but world-wide. To me, it is wide open.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">On a non-union ship, rig or platform, the workers may decide to go on strike for the sake of working conditions, better pay or safety reasons. I was on the <i>Ocean Ranger</i>, where we threatened to go on strike. We outlined all the issues regarding the dangers on board that rig, which was the largest in the world at the time. Within 12 months of the rig leaving Irish waters, she sank off the east coast of Canada with the loss of 84 people. That rig was designed for low-paid workers from the southern United States with no union rights whatsoever. If they challenged the management, they were treated like animals and shuttered off, their wages being withheld. Some of the people working on that rig could not go back to their own areas because of what they had done to the workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">It is very little different in many parts of the world today, where oil management treat workers as numbers to facilitate their objective of maximising profits at the expense of labour. I have asked the Minister to reconsider, but he will obviously not do so. I will have to call a vote on this. I will also respond to him regarding his meeting with Michael Dowling on the Seven Heads and having Irish labour on board. I am part of the offshore oil workers' committee, and we have had a terrible time trying to deal with the oil companies in that regard. They have a very sneaky way of doing things. They claim someone who comes in through the backdoor, working on the rigs in the North Sea is coming into Ireland, as part of Irish labour. However, they are coming in under UK rules for UK wages and without being unionised.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">There is a substantial job to do, and I hope we can get it right. The industry is large and can offer a great deal of employment both on and offshore. That must all be examined and addressed. I would welcome the opportunity to work with the Minister and the trade union movement in that regard, but I must oppose this, since it is wide open and does a terrible disservice to the trades union movement and workers not just here but throughout the world.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_538">This is the type of amendment the Minister might have considered. It is difficult when one is dealing with international legislation, as I said in my first contribution on the first amendment. Obviously, some of this goes back to 1989, and it is a fairly lengthy process getting countries to sign up. That is the difficult background. Having said that, my colleague has spoken of the very vulnerable position in which seafarers and maritime workers are placed. One need only listen to the stories of our colleagues who represent workers in the trades union movement to know the great difficulties they have speaking to workers and visiting ships or platforms. Even to determine conditions, they must effectively sneak on to vessels and they feel intimidated since given the long history in this area, vessels are like little states.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Looking back on the history of maritime law one knows terrible things were done in the past. This type of amendment is necessary, and perhaps the Minister and the Attorney General could have examined the wording in Deputy Ferris's name to see how it might best have been shaped. However one looks at it, we need a safeguard along those lines given what we know about the industry and how workers have been treated in every decade of its history. I urge the Minister once more to consider the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_296" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_540">I have given it a great deal of consideration and sought legal advice on the matter on two, if not three, occasions. While I share concerns about the conditions of those working on ships flying flags of convenience, this is not the legislation to deal with it. The Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act 1987 deals with some of the concerns of the Deputies opposite. The Health and Safety Authority is there to investigate, and we also have the maritime safety directorate of my Department. There is the European Commission and the International Maritime Organisation, so several bodies are there already to deal with some of the Deputies' concerns. Therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">This amendment again relates to criminal procedures and attempts to safeguard the rights of people involved in industrial relations and people's right to organise, whether it be on a rig or a ship.

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_303">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_665">I support the amendment, which is similar to the earlier amendment dealing with peaceful protest. We are concerned about the issue of workers' rights. I accept that we are entering into a wide-ranging area in terms of the application of law. The Minister of State referred earlier to existing legislation which offered a measure of protection to workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Presumably all of these important Acts were considered in the formulation of that legislation. The industry is unique although there is evidently a background of protection. We have had some interesting discussions on the legislation. Departmental officials brought some points to our attention this year and matters were also raised during discussions in committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">When one looks at some of the events that have taken place, even in far distant territories in the south Asia seas, for example, or in the Caribbean and various other places, it is understandable that trade union officials, specifically those in the International Transport Federation which is affiliated to SIPTU, our largest union, would have some concerns. They believe it is necessary to have a system of exclusions to ensure that fundamental basic rights gained by workers over many decades will not be whittled away. In that context, it is understandable that the right to organise, have collective bargaining and the minimum standard rights which are articulated in the amendment could be excluded to ensure no rogue or criminal employer could use this very draconian and necessarily tough legislation against a workforce and trade union representatives because in the past every opportunity was taken to attack workers' rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">We are a maritime nation with a vast expanse of sea that is ten times the size of our land mass. We are responsible for the marine environment and for everything that happens within it in terms of the conditions of workers. This matter could provide a useful subject for debate in future if we were to return to it to examine it in more detail. While we cannot police the seas of the world, we have to ensure trade union rights and the basic civil and working rights of workers are respected on our seas and in our ports. In the past, they have not been, which is the problem the amendment seeks to address.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_304" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_669">We already had a lengthy debate on this issue when we discussed the amendments tabled by the Deputies to section 2. The Bill, and the 1988 maritime convention and protocol to which it gives effect, addresses serious criminal acts that do not apply to normal activities, including industrial relations matters on board a ship or offshore fixed platform. The Industrial Relations Act 1990 does not provide immunity from prosecution for any terrorist act. It would clearly be inappropriate to amend the Bill so as to modify the application of the convention or protocol to exclude trade unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The essential feature of both the convention and protocol is their standard international application, in that they are applicable to foreign as well as Irish ships and offshore fixed platforms. Ireland could not act unilaterally. As I explained, there is no need for the amendment suggested to cover non-criminal acts. As I said previously, from meeting trade unions and workers on ships, I have some concerns in regard to flags of convenience. Perhaps we can take up Deputy Broughan's suggestion that in the new session we would undertake to have a meaningful examination and discussion of how ships operate, especially in Irish waters, in regard to compliance with standards.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_671">I am disappointed the Minister of State is not accepting the amendment, although his response was a foregone conclusion when the previous amendment was not accepted. It is regrettable that he has not accepted the two amendments tabled to enshrine the established rights of workers in the Bill and to protect workers from unscrupulous and criminal elements that are involved in the types of industry we have debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">It would have been a welcome development for Irish and international workers if the Government had accepted the amendments for which I am sure there would have been all-party support. Unfortunately, the Minister of State has not accepted the amendments. It would have been a strong statement to workers worldwide if this House had shown support for them by incorporating the amendments in the Bill. I regret he has not accepted the amendment and will, accordingly, be opposing the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, who is taking the second Bill in a row. I accept the Bill is a brief one, although my Fine Gael colleague is seeking to make a major amendment to the principal Act. It is regrettable that we are only now, four years later, dealing with legislation dating from 2000. I believe one of the amendments changes "2001" to "2004". It is regrettable that important legislation such as this on dredging and the dumping materials at sea has been given such low priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">There was considerable debate on Second Stage in which all parties participated. The wide-ranging discussion on the maintenance of the marine environment included issues such as Sellafield. It is regrettable that the Government, which has been in office from 2000 to the present, did not make it a priority to have the legislation passed as a number of issues were highlighted in the media.</p>

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_311">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_683">I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">Investment in the roads programme at €1.28 billion in 2004 is at its highest level ever and the beneficial impact of this investment is increasingly evident throughout the country. Virtually all projects under construction, particularly those being constructed under design and build contracts, are on budget and ahead of schedule, including the Monasterevin bypass and the Cashel bypass, both of which address key bottlenecks in the road network. Recent examples of major roads projects completed on time and within budget include the M1 at Cloghran, Lissenhall and Balbriggan and the Drogheda bypass, the Kildare bypass, Hurlers Cross and Shannon on the N18-N19 and the Youghal bypass on the N25.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">In considering the national roads programme and its development and management in recent years it is important to bear in mind the major expansion in the scale of the programme over the period since 2000. Initial preliminary costing of the programme of work proved difficult due to the limited information available from the smaller preceding programme and the preliminary scheme outlines available as a basis for costing. In general, a comparison of outturn with tender costs, as opposed to initial unrefined scheme estimates, provides the most reliable guide to project and programme management performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">To provide greater certainty about resources, which facilitates more cost effective implementation of the programme, I have secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance to the introduction of a multi-annual funding framework for national road investment. It provides for total national road development investment of more than €8 billion, of which €6.9 billion is Exchequer funding and €1.1 billion will be invested by the private sector in PPPs over the period from 2004 to 2008. I have asked the NRA to submit a five-year plan to ensure that the resources being made available under the capital envelope are utilised to best effect. The envelope will be underpinned by an agreement between my Department and the Department of Finance, which will incorporate provisions relating, <i>inter alia</i>, to the annual funding levels, contractual commitments and reporting and monitoring arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">I have consistently highlighted to the National Roads Authority the importance of strengthening cost estimation, control systems and procedures on the management and implementation of the national roads programme. In recent years, the NRA has implemented a range of measures to improve cost estimation and control. These include the greater use of design and build lump sum fixed price contracts offering cost efficiencies, greater certainty of outturn costs and reduced scope for claims; standardisation of economic designs for high cost items such as bridges and other structures; securing greater involvement by foreign contractors; buy-out of price variation clause and risk where this gives good value; further attention to improving quality of site investigations and acceptance of such investigations by contractors as the agreed basis for pricing; and greater use of PPPs which leverage private sector investment in the programme, incentivise private sector innovation and limit the risk exposure of the Exchequer by transferring risk, including construction risk, to the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">Since the publication of the NDP in 1999 the cost of the national roads programme mandated in the NDP has increased substantially from €6.96 billion, which reflected early 1999 prices at preliminary design stage, to €16.4 billion based on end 2003 prices and more refined estimates. The reasons for this increase from initial estimates drawn up in advance of detailed scheme design to the more refined scheme estimates now available have been examined in some detail by the Comptroller and Auditor General and major independent evaluations of the national roads programme by Fitzpatrick Associates in 2002 and Indecon in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">The main reasons for the increase in costs are construction cost inflation, which accounts for 40% of the increase — since 2001 construction cost inflation has moderated from an annual average of 12% to less than 5%; more reliable estimates as schemes were refined as the design process proceeded; changes in scope of projects including upgrading of routes and higher road standards; and additional cost of land acquisition. The various measures taken to date are acknowledged in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the other evaluations of the roads programme both of which acknowledged that the national roads investment programme is, in general, well managed and, in particular, as regards factors within the control of the NRA.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">As part of the continuing effort by the NRA to improve management of the programme a major consultancy assignment on arrangements for the implementation of the programme, including cost estimation and control, has recently been completed. Its recommendations are being given detailed consideration and I will be anxious to ensure that those relating particularly to programme management and cost control will be implemented as a matter of priority.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_312">
            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_691">Does the Minister agree that the cost of the project which is now €9 billion in excess of the original estimation gives rise to serious concern? It is now costing €16 million per mile to construct our roads programme. No comment has been made by the National Roads Authority and the absence of a comment from the Minister until today is a damning indictment of this massive cost overrun. Money has been thrown away and it is robbing from key infrastructure required in many parts of the country, especially the west, which is underdeveloped.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">While the Minister made the comment regarding the cost overrun, he did not mention that 25% of the cost overrun was due to underestimation in prices. While the Minister makes the point that this was the pre-2000 case, is it not true that these concerns and the inadequacies in cost estimation were known as far back as 1998? Is it not also true that the cost overruns in 2002 were still at 9%? Does the Minister not agree that is a damning indictment of the Department of Transport, which is supposed to be supervising the NRA? It is my understanding that fixed price contracts cannot extend beyond an 11-month duration. Is that still the case or have those regulations been amended?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_313" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_693">The Comptroller and Auditor General identified the main reasons for the increases in the cost of the national primary route programme to be 40% due to construction inflation, 16% due to failure to accurately cost elements at the planning stage, 20% due to changes in the scope of projects and 24% due to project specific increases, such as, some of the motorway schemes and elements of the port tunnel. In the past two years I made two important changes to ensure that projects come in on time and on budget. One was to agree a multi-annual programme with the Minister for Finance which allows for better management of the system by getting rid of the stop-go method we had before that. The second was to ask the NRA to introduce a fixed price system. I will check out the query about the 11 months but my understanding is that fixed pricing can go well beyond a period of 11 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">I have stated publicly on a number of occasions that I strongly believe the figure for national roads in the 1999 national development plan was totally unrealistic. It did not include a range of projects, a list of which is available, which are now being done. It was envisaged that many of the inter-urban routes to Cork and Galway and so on would be a single carriageway, when, in fact, we decided to build motorways. Another factor, and this happens all the time — I even do it myself — is that when somebody looks at a capital project, he produces a ballpark figure. However, the only relevant figure is the figure in the actual estimate to which one says "yes" or "no" with regard to the cost of carrying out the work. The only sensible comparison is between the price on the day one signed that contract, including the price variation clause and the outturn. It is good politics to compare the original ballpark figure with the final outturn, but it is not accurate to do that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_314">
            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_695">The Government provided the figures.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_315">
            <from>Ms Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_696">Figures may be used to prove anything. The Minister has suggested that 40% of the increased cost is due to inflation. The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that a quarter of that figure was due to under estimation of the prices. My question is what systems have been put in place to ensure that estimates are accurate? A further 16% of the increase was due to a systematic failure to cost certain elements of schemes and a further 20% was due to changes in the scope of projects and new works. It is not possible to deliver a programme when there is such lack of certainty from the very start and such weak systems in place. I acknowledge that the NRA has taken some steps to improve the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">I am concerned at the Minister's assertion about fixed price contracts and public private partnerships delivering certainty of cost outturn. While they may do that, what steps is the Minister taking to ensure the public is getting value for money? Has the Minister considered the system that increasingly is being used in Britain and which some members of the Transport Committee had explained to them in detail on a recent visit to the British Department of Transport. They have a system of "preferred prime contractor" based on best value criteria. I think this is the critical issue. We must know what value we are getting for money. There must be a benchmark against which prices and estimates may be measured. Does the Minister intend to move towards such a system and has he inquired about the system in Britain? What can we learn from that?</p>
            <p eId="para_698">Two other critical areas that impact significantly on the escalating cost of the road programme, is the cost of property acquisition and professional fees. Promises have been made for a new national roads authority Bill, or a critical infrastructure Bill or other such names. There is an urgent need to introduce legislation to control this area. What stage is it at and when can we expect to see the Bill? We have an archaic system whereby consultant engineers are paid a fee based on 4% of the contract price. They have no incentive to keep costs down. For example, if the cost of a project escalates by 200%, the consultant engineers get an increase of 200% in their fees. Could we have a fixed fee for consultant engineer or some type of incentive built into the project to keeps costs under some level of control?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_316" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_699">I agree with the Deputy on many of the points she raised. The Minister for Finance decided recently that consultant fees on all projects would change from a proportional fee to a negotiated figure that was settled upon. Obviously that cannot apply to existing projects but it will apply to new projects. I agree entirely with the Deputy that professionals must be paid for the job as opposed to being paid a percentage of the cost of the job to give them an incentive to finish early.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">I have asked the National Roads Authority to supply a costing of the cost per kilometre of identical roads in the United Kingdom, Germany and France and I hope to have that information very shortly. The Deputies may be aware that we carried out a similar exercise in regard to Luas, where we compared the cost of building a kilometre of light rail in other member states, which came out at €30 million per kilometre and we benchmarked that against the cost of a kilometre of Luas, which was there or thereabouts. It would be useful to benchmark a kilometre of road.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">In my travels around the country when I would open these projects, I inquired on site, having compared the figures, which ranged from €7 million to €17 million per kilometre, the reason for the cost variation of a kilometre of road. I was taken to the section of road and shown that it had four overpasses and 16 viaducts which explained the difference. When the documentation was provided, the argument stacked up. I will try to do more benchmarking exercises, so that we can ensure that the work is carried out at a comparable cost to similar work in other member states. At the end of the day, the real test is to be able to build a kilometre of motorway at approximately the same cost as in nine or ten other countries. I will draw a comparison with international experiences.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">I reassure the House that virtually all the projects are coming in on schedule. The changes I have made on fixed price contracting and multi-annual budgeting has ensured that is the case. I will keep the pressure on.</p>

     <b>Mr. Connolly</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Transport</b>
     if he has had discussions with the Northern authorities regarding the integration of the penalty points system North and South; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
     [20581/04]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_319" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_706">Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding, seat belt wearing, insurance and careless driving offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in the case of speeding and seat belt wearing offences to prevent the instigation of court proceedings. The full application of the penalty points system will be achieved when the relevant information technology systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">Penalty point systems now operate in this country, Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The authorities in both jurisdictions are considering the introduction of a scheme to provide for the mutual recognition of penalty points between the United Kingdom and Ireland. This consideration is being pursued under the auspices of the British-Irish Council. One of the first matters that needs to be addressed before full mutual recognition can be realised will be the introduction of bilateral recognition of the separate penalty points systems operating in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_320">
            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_708">I thank the Minister for his answer. I live in the Border area and would be familiar with driver patterns in Northern Ireland. Drivers in Northern Ireland in particular are law-abiding. Will the Minister explain why these same drivers tend to lose all respect for the law when they come south of the Border and their driving behaviour differs dramatically in this jurisdiction? Drivers in the Republic quite often tend to follow the flow. Does the Minister believe non-harmonisation of penalties for Northern Ireland drivers with those levied in this jurisdiction might be responsible for the fact that of the nine national blackspots for accidents, five are located in the North Eastern Health Board area which is bordered by northern counties? Some 25% of all fatal accidents occur within the North Eastern Health Board area.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">It should also be borne in mind that in my own county, Monaghan, there is the main north-south Derry-Dublin access and the east-west Belfast-west of Ireland access. In spite of this there is no accident and emergency department in Monaghan General Hospital. That is one of the dangers there.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">What factors inhibit harmonisation of the two systems and when is the likely date for implementation? Will the Government negotiate bilateral agreements with its EU partners for mutual recognition of penalty points throughout the different jurisdictions? This is especially important given that we have many more foreign cars on our roads now on a semi-permanent basis. It would make sense if drivers break the same laws that they should suffer the same penalties throughout the EU.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_321" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_711">I share the Deputy's concern and I have approached the Northern Ireland and the UK authorities about speeding up the process of mutual recognition. Both jurisdictions agree in principle that this should be done and we are now working on the logistics of how this should happen. I have seen the statistics and am also aware of the road fatality toll in the north-eastern part of the country, in particular Louth and Meath. The figures are a cause for concern and I am especially conscious of that. The Deputy is right to raise the matter again.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">The construction of the M1 motorway has, I suppose, become an attractive speedway for an increasing number of Northern drivers. We will have to sort out the reciprocal penalty points system and we are working on it. I have asked for a meeting with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State in the coming weeks to discuss a range of infrastructural issues, including cross-Border roads. I specifically propose to raise this issue with him to see if more progress can be made.</p>

     the progress to date with regard to the reopening of the western rail corridor; the maximum cost figure his Department will consider as reasonable for State funding to be invested in such a project; the financial evaluation his Department has carried out on the project; if economic and social considerations such as the growth in tourism will be factored into the financing of the project; if the same consideration given to the financing of Luas and other praiseworthy roadwork initiatives in the greater Dublin area will be applied to the evaluation of the western rail corridor, albeit on a much smaller scale; if he will guarantee that the project will not be delayed by the setting up of more review committees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_322" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_714">I visited the western rail corridor, WRC, line and location for a full day recently to see for myself the possibilities. I am anxious to provide the proponents of the western rail corridor with the opportunity to put forward their case as comprehensively as possible and to facilitate a thoroughgoing examination of the proposal. Accordingly, I have recently established an expert working group to carry out a full examination of the WRC proposal and to examine the potential for reopening the line.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">The working group held its inaugural meeting in Galway, which I attended and addressed, on 14 June under the chairmanship of Mr. Pat McCann, chief executive of JurysDoyle Hotels. The group comprises county managers, directors of the regional authorities, representatives of city and county development boards, the Western Development Commission, West-on-Track, the inter-county rail committee, Iarnród Éireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, and the Department of Transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">The working group will examine and evaluate all aspects of the western rail corridor plan, including its costs and benefits, the travel demand that gives rise to the proposal, how such a project might be funded, where the corridor stands in the context of the findings of the national spatial strategy, the strategic rail review, regional planning guidelines, relevant county and city development and land use plans, the submissions put forward as regards the proposal and the current and proposed road investment programmes. In keeping with the criteria governing cost-benefit analyses, the full economic, social and environmental benefits of the proposal, including tourism, will be taken into account in any evaluation of the WRC by the working group.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">Before decisions are made to proceed with the funding of any particular transport project, irrespective of its location, it must be evaluated on the basis of the costs and benefits that are likely to accrue from it. By and large, if the benefits outweigh the costs over the life of the project, it is considered worth proceeding with. Whether it is proceeded with, however, and its timescale for completion depends on the availability of funding and the project's degree of prioritisation <i>vis-à-vis</i> other competing demands for funding from the resources available at any one time. The WRC will be evaluated in the same way and I await the working group’s findings. It is an opportunity for the proponents to demonstrate that this western vision can be turned into reality.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_323">
            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_718">If ever I heard a statement indicating that something was going to be long-fingered and shelved, that must be it. I must take a copy of it for some future date. Will the Minister agree that the expert working group was just a long-fingering initiative to tide the Government over the local elections? Another group will probably be set up prior to the general election. The Minister set out a number of criteria as regards the spatial strategy and the roads programme, but he appears to have left one gaping hole, namely EU proposals regarding the "motorway of the sea", which is critically important for many businesses along the western and south-western seaboards as regards development and access to European markets. Why was that not considered as a critical element? I believe it is and should be taken into consideration as regards the western rail corridor.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">Are we going to have another chicken and egg situation where the western rail corridor will not be developed until the population is in place and the corridor itself will not be viable without the population? It is going to be the same again. The investment will not be put in without the population and the population will not be there without the investment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_324" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_720">That is one of the dilemmas facing all major infrastructural projects. Should it be built and wait for the population to arrive or should we have the population in place first and then build it? That dilemma exists regardless of what major project one examines. I have made it clear through the tactical composition of the expert group the way it is to be handled in this case. I have spoken to the county managers and so on at the group's inaugural meeting. They cannot say that they want to reopen the railway line and then, at their country council meetings, zone land away from it or locate their settlement patterns away from the line. If rail lines are to be reopened, then the audit strategies in the hands of local authorities must be complementary. They must indicate in their plans where the populations will be. We cannot have the luxury of the line in one place and the population and facilities in another. There must be land use complementarity because, with that, we can get progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">I recently announced the reopening of the Midleton railway line at a cost of €90 million. I want to compliment the people of that area and the agencies. They produced approximately €40 million of the money themselves from local industry and investment. It is to their great credit. The Cork county manager, who was instrumental in making that happen, spoke to the western rail corridor expert group at my request on 14 June. I attended the meeting, at which the county manager explained to the group how the project may be pursued. It is a not a question of rushing out to build a few hundred miles of track and keeping one's fingers crossed, but of financing, zoning and an integrated plan, which takes population into account. The whole thing should be brought together in an orderly and phased way.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_325">
            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_722">I find it humorous to hear the Minister talking about land use because there does not seem to be any land use strategy in Dublin. When one travels by train from the west of Ireland to Dublin, one continues to see vast tracts of land that have not been developed until one is almost in the city centre. There has been investment in Dublin despite the fact that there has not been a land use strategy. The Minister is saying that there has to be such a strategy in the west. I agree with the Minister that the population should be focused in the areas in question, but we also need to get a commitment from him that he is prepared to support the project if the thing stacks up. He has not yet made such a commitment.</p>

     <b>Dr. Twomey</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Transport</b>
     if his attention has been drawn to the policy changes by Iarnród Éireann to reduce the number of powerful locomotives which may have an adverse effect on the future of freight travel on the Irish rail system, especially the seasonal haulage of sugar beet.

            <p eId="para_727">The allocation and deployment of locomotives and other rolling stock is strictly a matter for Iarnród Éireann. The company has assured me that it has sufficient numbers of suitable locomotives in its fleet to provide for the future demands of the freight business, including the seasonal haulage of sugar beet.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_330">
            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_728">I have raised this issue because there has been a dramatic change in the type of rolling stock being used by Iarnród Éireann. The rolling stock used on the line between Rosslare and Dublin has recently been replaced. The company has replaced the locomotives which were being used and put in place a basic commuter service instead, using trains of limited capacity. Much of the capacity is for standing passengers. I believe that large locomotives have been replaced by commuter-type trains in other parts of the country. The freight service has been practically taken off the railway lines in Northern Ireland. I am aware that Iarnród Éireann has invested in some locomotives, but their use is mainly being restricted to the inter-city service. There does not seem to be ongoing investment in the big locomotives about which I am talking, which are used for hauling sugar beet and other freight.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">The Minister has said that Iarnród Éireann has the power to decide on its own policies, but decisions which are made now will have effects down the line, for example on the transport of sugar beet. It was said at one time that the railway line between Waterford and Limerick was to be closed, which would have affected the transport of beet. If locomotives are taken off the line and are not available when we reach a crisis because stock has been run down, it will be the responsibility of the Minister rather than Iarnród Éireann. We are seeing a change in passenger services in that smaller trains, which are not as powerful and do not have the same capacity because they cannot be expanded, are being used. We could have a crisis in this regard in five or ten years time. The Minister should know about this issue rather than saying that it is a matter of Iarnród Éireann policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">I appreciate the Deputy's concern and I will bring his comments to the attention of Iarnród Éireann. The company has recently gone to tender for a major overhaul of its fleet of large locomotives and has reduced its number of smaller locomotives, many of which had expired. Deputies are aware that the transport of beet by rail was severely disrupted last year when a viaduct collapsed near Cahir. The usual rail transport arrangements will be restored when this year's beet season commences, with services operating from Wellington Bridge in south Wexford to Limerick Junction and on to Mallow.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">Iarnród Éireann has informed me that it is reshaping its freight business to focus more on the business best suited to rail. It will concentrate on long-haul heavy goods rather than short journeys which are time-sensitive. As a result of the actions it has taken over the past 18 months, Iarnród Éireann has started to reduce its freight losses and has won back some business, for example from Coillte. I will pass Deputy Twomey's comments and concerns on to the company.</p>

            <p eId="para_739">The programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a metro with a link to Dublin Airport. I have received from the Railway Procurement Agency the revised outline business case for line 1 of the metro, which involves a line from the airport to the city centre. The total estimated direct capital cost of construction in 2002 prices is €1.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">Integration of public transport services in the greater Dublin area is being pursued within the broad policy framework of the Dublin Transportation Office's Platform for Change. In this regard, the possibility of a connection with the Tallaght and Sandyford Luas lines is being considered in the context of the first phase of the metro project from the city centre to the airport. The timescale, precise cost and route, number and location of stations and arrangements for connections with the Luas lines will depend on a number of factors including the final Government decision, geo-technical surveys, negotiations with bidders and railway order processes including a public inquiry. The merits of all alternative solutions and routes will be considered in the preparation of a submission for the Government on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">I welcome the Joint Committee on Transport's recent report on the proposal for a Dublin metro system, which was a valuable contribution to the debate on this issue. In particular, I welcome the recommendation in favour of a metro system with a connection to the airport. I am finalising my proposals on the metro in the context of the wider transport needs of the greater Dublin area. I expect the Government to finalise proposals on the metro in the near future.</p>

Although there has been a great deal of talk and many reports and various committees have met to discuss the project, it is hard to know whether it is going anywhere. Will the Minister tell the House when he intends to bring a proposal to Cabinet? What did the Taoiseach mean by his comments last week?</p>

            <p eId="para_745">This issue has been discussed by the Cabinet and various committees over the past year, on and off. I discussed it bilaterally with the Taoiseach and many Ministers during that period. We asked the RPA to reconsider the matter after it had given its original estimations. It came back to us with a direct capital cost estimation of €1.2 billion. The programme for Government commits the Government to developing a metro from the airport to the city centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_747">It is a Government commitment. We are in the final phases of seeing how best we can finance the project, service the financing and move the project forward without too much delay. I agree with the Taoiseach's comments about the prospect of immediately starting to build the entire metro system, as proposed by the DTO. The project would last 20 or 30 years and would cost many billions. One can pick any number — it might cost €15 billion, €20 billion or €30 billion. We will not do that because we cannot afford it. The Taoiseach and I do not envisage the immediate construction of the entire city-wide metro system, but we envisage living up to the commitment in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">The RPA, which has done a substantial amount of work in this regard, has selected the recommended route. They originally had three routes but have narrowed it down to one recommendation. They have whittled down their estimates from over €2 billion to €1.2 billion and they are now in a position to allow us to take some final decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_763">Will the Minister define the difference between "the near future" and "shortly"? He appears to rotate those terms when referring to the timescale for the presentation to Cabinet. The Minister has been using them for the past 12 or 18 months but it is like a broken record at this stage. Will the Minister define those terms and outline the timescale involved? When will a decision be made on this matter?</p>
            <p eId="para_764">In light of the fact that the Minister is now standing over the RPA figures, does he not believe it is inadequate of the RPA to cost figures based on the fact that they will adversely affect potential customers of the metro? Does he not agree that the reduction in the number of stations, escalators and ticketing machines will reduce the number of people who may use the metro and generate an income?</p>
            <p eId="para_765">The Minister stated on a number of occasions in the past that the metro to Dublin Airport from the city centre is not a stand-alone project but the first step in a larger metro project. In light of his comments earlier, and the Taoiseach's comments this morning that the project to the airport is enormously costly and that the Cabinet would not consider an extension to the entire Dublin area, does the Minister stand over his comments on the metro from the city centre to the airport as a stand-alone project? Has he done a U-turn on that? Has the Irish Rail plan been taken off the table or is it ongoing?</p>

What the Taoiseach and I are saying is that we cannot undertake the city and county-wide system now but it is sensible that what we do here forms the first leg of an overall city and county plan, which is in the DTO platform for change. That is totally consistent.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">In regard to the Irish Rail project, the DTO also recommends that an interconnector be developed as well as other similar proposals. They are also necessary and it is a matter of deciding which of these we get to first. These are multi-billion euro projects and I am determined that the first project we will do, before the Irish Rail project, will be the metro project because it is necessary to link the Luas——</p>

That would be a fantastic addition to the city. I have told the Taoiseach, the Cabinet and my colleagues that I am fully committed to finalising the funding arrangements to bring that into being. I am not deliberately delaying on this in any way; I just want to get it right, and as soon as it is right I will push the button, but not before.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">I accept the Minister now sees the sense in the RPA proposal but the problem, as we saw this morning, is that the Taoiseach does not believe in it. He was asked specifically for his opinion of the Dublin metro plan and all he could say was that it was very expensive and how could we possibly pay for it, which means that it is dead in the water, so to speak, in Cabinet. In those circumstances, would the Minister not be better off getting a decision from the Cabinet? His Government colleagues would then have to face the reality of the other options we might have to pursue including, as the Minister said, linking the current Luas line in St. Stephen's Green?</p>
            <p eId="para_771">Does the Minister believe that the alternative to a metro would be reversion to the original Luas proposal, which would see the two lines connecting and a third line heading north from O'Connell Street towards the airport? Given that in the past the Minister said that the Irish Rail option of a spur from the DART line is not feasible, will he agree that the next best option, if we cannot afford the metro, is that original Luas proposal?</p>
            <p eId="para_772">The Minister prevaricated on this issue for a year. He said he had to "put them back through the hoops" on the figures but the reality is that those figures were confirmed a year ago. He has sat on them for a year and in that time 70,000 houses have been built. The longer we put off this decision, the more houses will be built alongside roadways instead of public transport lines, on which we do not know if the Government has a view. A planning issue arises here and every week the Minister waits is an extra thousand houses built in the wrong place. That is the real cost of the Minister's indecision on this issue over the past year.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">First, I did not sit on it for a year. The work that was going on in the RPA only concluded recently when I received the answers to the final queries I made. I was not satisfied to proceed on the basis of what was presented to me and I continued to make the queries until I got the answers. Now that I have the answers I am satisfied to go ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Second, I think what the Taoiseach was referring to is that there is a perception that Dublin gets everything — the M50, Luas, the metro and so on. There is a need to explain to the rest of the country that every time another €1 billion project is proposed for Dublin our citizens in Cork, Galway and throughout the country can have access to it and avail of its services. I think the Taoiseach was referring to that type of thinking when he talked about not doing the entire €15 billion, €20 billion or €30 billion project tomorrow.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">In short, the Department of Transport and myself are strongly committed to this metro project. We finally got the answers we pushed hard for over some time. If the Deputy looks at the figures we are now operating on he will see it was worth the wait. A route is selected and it is now a matter for my Cabinet colleagues and myself to bring finality to this, which I am determined to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_791">There is a need for joined-up thinking in the Department of Transport and at Cabinet. The Minister spoke of the need for a western rail corridor and raised the argument as to whether the infrastructure should come first or after development. However, he does not accept that principle because there is no proven demand for the western rail corridor.</p>

            <p eId="para_793">The Minister did when he spoke about the eternal argument about whether infrastructure should come first or whether one should wait for development. It makes sense to put the infrastructure in place first. The Minister had no difficulty spending billions of euro on roads in the greater Dublin area. As Deputy Eamon Ryan pointed out, development has occurred along those roads leading to morning and evening traffic chaos. This is due to the lack of linkage between housing development and transport policies. An agency is needed to plan for housing development and transport together rather than separately as it is now.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">Regarding the proposed metro, is the Minister taking on board the Committee on Transport's recommendation on the necessity of identifying an agency with a proven track record of delivering projects on time and within budget?</p>

            <p eId="para_796">The clear implication of this recommendation is that the Railway Procurement Agency is not the one to deliver a metro. The Taoiseach is correct in describing the cost as astronomical. Ways of managing it must be found. Half the cost of the metro could be provided through development levies on sites between Swords and Dublin city centre with no charge on the Exchequer. Is the Minister exploring that option?</p>

            <p eId="para_797">I will study further the recommendations of the Committee on Transport on the metro. However, the Railway Procurement Agency is the best agency equipped to build a metro. The Dublin Transportation Office and the local authorities' planning guidelines contain integrated considerations for land use and transport and housing needs. I am in favour of levies for development on the metro line.</p>

            <p eId="para_799">Now that the Minister for Transport has confidence in the Railway Procurement Agency, is there any point in building a metro if people are not prepared to use it? Will people use it if they have to climb up and down staircases because the Railway Procurement Agency cut back on the number of escalators? What about the reduction in the number of stations? To extend the metro from three carriages to four will require a boring machine to be brought back. The cost has been reduced to €1.2 billion because the Railway Procurement Agency has downgraded the specification for the proposed metro. It is important that people use the service when it is up and running and that the customer is looked after. Since the Railway Procurement Agency has already ignored this, it should not be the agency with responsibility for it.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">I share the Minister's confidence in the Railway Procurement Agency as it did an excellent job in delivering the Luas, given the mess made by the Government causing a three year delay in its completion. Given that the other proposed metro lines will be scrapped, why should the Department of Transport not ask the Dublin Transportation Office to review its platform for change? Will the Minister review the regional planning guidelines which allow for housing to grow along the new roads that are planned, taking no cognisance of previous plans that proposed concentration back towards the centre along public transport lines? Now that the broader metro project has been reduced, the Minister must review housing and transport planning.</p>

On a recent train to Drogheda, the air conditioning failed in three carriages and six people fainted and one lady had an asthma attack, as reported in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i>. Is it Iarnród Éireann’s judgment that this train to Drogheda was overcrowded? Many passengers believe that, owing to the failure of an earlier train, more people were forced to take this one.

In addition, a technical problem occurred with the air conditioning units on some of the individual carriages on the train which compounded the discomfort experienced by Iarnród Éireann's customers on that hot day. Iarnród Éireann is conducting a full examination of all of its newly-acquired diesel rail cars to ensure no recurrence of the problem.

He has not arranged Committee or Report Stages of the railway safety commission Bill which could set down standards and guidelines and enforce them on that service and every other rail service in the country? When will we see the railway safety commission legislation enacted? The Minister should not simply tell us he has an interim commissioner in place. When will we see the legislation to back that up? The previous Minister said this was critical legislation because the current legislation did not allow for adequate investigating powers. The current Minister has dragged his heels on the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_833">That is the point. One must have these safety protocols in place. They must be absolute and apply in all these conditions. The Minister could identify with the help of Iarnród Éireann the number of staff on duty on the platform on that day to make sure that train was not overcrowded. I understand that on the 5.13 p.m. train from Pearse Station to Drogheda there were hundreds of people pushing into those carriages. I have never seen uniformed and clearly identifiable Iarnród Éireann staff ensuring that people can get safely onto their trains. What criteria will the Minister insist are used by Iarnród Éireann in future when people are being packed into trains like sardines?</p>

     the position in regard to the Shannon stopover; the decisions that were reached on this issue at the meeting of EU Transport Ministers on 10 and 11 June 2004; the discussions he has had with US officials on the subject; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
     [20403/04]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_426" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_850">I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 52 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">EU Transport Ministers discussed this issue at the Transport Council held on 11 June 2004. At that time there was a proposed air transport agreement between the EU and the US on the table which would have included open skies between the EU and US. Transport Ministers felt that the deal on offer was unbalanced in favour of the US and asked the European Commission to continue urgent negotiations with the US, particularly in view of the then upcoming EU-US summit on 26 June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">Despite those last minute efforts by the Commission, it was not possible to bridge the gap in time for the EU-US summit. Accordingly, the negotiations are now paused for the summer. I understand that contacts between the EU and US sides will recommence possibly in September with full negotiations commencing possibly by the end of this year on the few items that are left to be agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">During the discussions at the Transport Council, Ireland once again made it clear that while we are in favour of reaching an EU agreement with the US, Ireland's agreement is contingent on an acceptable arrangement on Shannon Airport being agreed between Ireland and the US, and that deal being reflected in the EU-US agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">On 4 and 5 May 2004, my officials travelled to Washington to discuss this issue with the US. I also spoke to the US Transportation Secretary, Norman Mineta, about this issue when I met him at various meetings on a number of occasions in the months leading up to the Transport Council. No agreement was reached at any of these meetings. However, I am satisfied that had an EU-US deal emerged from the Transport Council, an arrangement for Shannon Airport would have been reached between Ireland and the US in the run-up to the signing of the EU-US deal at the summit.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">Currently, there are no EU-US negotiations taking place. However, that does not mean that Ireland or the EU can stand still. There is no doubt that an EU-US agreement is inevitable once the difficult issue of market access for both EU and US carriers is solved. I am therefore maintaining contact with the US side.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_427">
            <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_856">Does the Minister think that a ten-year lead-in period for change in the current bilateral agreement would be better than the much shorter period he is proposing? Deputy Naughten noted that the Minister is long-fingering development of the western rail track, but he is certainly fast-tracking his airport policy. A ten-year lead-in period would ensure that the infrastructure, such as the rail and road links and so on, is in place which would give Shannon a chance to get new business. The Minister knows that satisfactory talks were held with US officials in Dromoland Castle and he could negotiate a ten-year agreement. It is important.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">Regarding the proposed sale of Aer Lingus, if the Government becomes a minority shareholder, will the current bilateral agreement be null and void?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_428" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_858">It is not up to the Irish Government. The bilateral situation cannot continue indefinitely. I know that the Signal group in Shannon has put a figure of ten years on it, and I would be happy to get as many years as possible. It is a matter for negotiation in the sense that access to the US by Aer Lingus, for example, is important. I am told that up to 20 cities in the United States have indicated to Aer Lingus that it could have access if it had the aircraft to fly into them. It currently flies into five cities in the United States. I am told that up to 20 cities have approached Aer Lingus to indicate they would like services. While that is not to say Aer Lingus will operate from those cities or has the aircraft to do so, the indication is there.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">When the EU-US talks recommence, particularly when the United States election is out of the way, there will be fairly quick agreement and we will get open skies. My job is to ensure, in the context of open skies between the United States and Europe, that we get a deal for Shannon that gives it time and space to put plans in place and to further develop the airport. I am totally opposed to any sudden shocks for Shannon in this area and totally supportive of getting the most appropriate and maximum space for it in the context of the open skies policy generally, which in the long term will be of benefit to Shannon as well as to the country. I am determined I can deliver for Shannon the best possible deal and assure the House I am on Shannon's side in this debate.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_429">
            <from>Ms Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_860">The Minister keeps saying he is on Shannon's side and wants to see the west develop, which is fine. However, let us hear what he is actually trying to achieve. The Minister says he wants to ensure an acceptable arrangement for Shannon. What, in his view, is an acceptable arrangement in terms of the phasing out of the dual gateway policy? Would the Minister not accept that whatever the critics of the stopover say, it has been the only meaningful instrument used by Government over many years to achieve some kind of balance in regional development? If the Minister is on the side of Shannon, has he any proposals for when the stopover is completely phased out in terms of improving access to the airport so that passengers can reach it more easily than they can currently gain access to Dublin Airport, and ensuring the achievement of other spin-offs? What does the Minister regard as an acceptable arrangement in terms of phasing? How will he compensate for the loss of business due to the ending of the stopover?</p>

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_430" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
            <p eId="para_861">Much is going on in the Shannon region. A significant amount of money is being invested in infrastructure, Ennis has been by-passed, the motorway to Galway has been privatised to create access to the airport and a study of the rail link from Ennis to the airport has been sanctioned. In addition, the Irish Aviation Authority and Enterprise Ireland are being moved to Shannon. The investment in the infrastructure of the region shows that the Government is fully committed to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">On the aviation side, I will accept the best number of years I can get to allow the Shannon Airport Authority to attract other airlines and United States cities, and more direct business from the United States, the UK, the EU and generally. I am sure that whatever package we can put together will be acceptable to the people of Shannon as a practical road forward. I will work day and night to bring about that acceptable deal.</p>

            <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_863">Is it not a fact that the European Commission has no problem with any internal arrangements Ireland has with the US and that the senior aviation official in the European Union is on record as saying this? If Aer Lingus is sold or the Government becomes a minority shareholder, is it not the case that the current bilateral agreement becomes null and void?</p>

            <p eId="para_864">The bilateral agreement has nothing to do with Aer Lingus as such. It applies to all airlines. Whoever owns the airline — Americans, Chinese or otherwise — airlines coming from the United States have to abide by the bilateral agreement.</p>

Members of the House have experience of dealing with planning procedures, An Bord Pleanála and so forth and our major concern is that we must work at frantic, breakneck speed when trying to make submissions. I welcome the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">I tried earlier to work out the import of the amendment Bill for the principal Act so I can understand what Deputy Kehoe is trying to achieve. The provision should be as simple as possible so citizens can understand their rights with regard to the critical matter of protecting the environment. I commend Deputy Kehoe and Deputy Ryan on these amendments.</p>

A copy of each application for a dumping at sea permit is posted on the Department's website on receipt and may be accessed immediately by any interested person.

          <p eId="para_906">This amendment is a continuation of the same point made in the earlier amendment in terms of the length of time for which the developer or person seeking a licence is required to put a notice of that in a local newspaper. The argument has been made both on Committee Stage and, separately, by the officials that it is necessary to give companies a certain period of time to arrange this. However, the nature of the permits being sought mean they are rarely for small scale emergency operations but require a good deal of forethought and organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">In such circumstances it should be possible for someone seeking a permit to advertise in a relevant newspaper within 14 days. Time is sometimes of the essence. It is difficult for the public to be aware of what is threatening or affecting the environment. We should therefore do everything possible to support the public in raising concerns. Swift advertising of the notice in this case would be a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 relate to types of permit. We had some debate on this on Committee Stage. The nature of the permit sought is relevant, particularly in estuary areas where different newspapers are read on either side of the estuary. Typically, on one side of an estuary an advertisement regarding a dredging development might be carried in a local newspaper which appeals to a community which does not have a particular interest in the dredging development, whereas the community on the other side of the estuary which has a keen interest in such a development would not see the advertisement because it has not appeared in their local newspaper.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">The intent of amendment No. 6 is to recognise that possibility and ensure that advertisements are placed in a number of different newspapers in an area, or in any local newspaper which is circulated close to the area in respect of which the permit sought. That would not be hugely expensive. It would be a fraction of the cost of the works involved, a minute expenditure. It would not constitute a major administrative burden. Once an advertisement is placed in a newspaper it can quite easily be replicated elsewhere. It would ensure that the public is informed about these often very significant developments which they would not otherwise know about until they saw a dredger in an estuary or bay. These are small but significant amendments aimed at achieving public involvement in the process and which I hope the Minister of State will support.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_458">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_910">I will speak on amendments Nos. 5, 16 and 17 in my name. I support the comments made by my colleague. The Minister of State has moved an amendment similar to amendment No. 5 which provides for publication in a newspaper circulating nationally. The point has been very well made by Deputy Eamon Ryan that different sides of a bay or a large coastal area may constitute different regions in terms of newspaper circulation. That is a fundamental reason for ensuring national publication of such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">There is increasing interest in the marine environment. A number of specialised groups, such as the UCC group, CoCoNet, and various other groups are interested in monitoring dredging and other issues of dumping at sea around our coastline. It is important that such interested parties should have relevant information which would not otherwise be available to people unless they were residents of or regular visitors to an area. That is what I am seeking in amendment No. 5. I support amendment No. 4 and the principle of amendment No. 6 for the same reason, namely, that people should be given the earliest warning of dredging or discharge into the marine environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Like most people, my experience has been in dealing with ordinary planning applications, appeals, oral hearings and so on with An Bord Pleanála. I am therefore conscious of the importance of giving interested parties the maximum amount of time in which to respond to and make submissions. That is why, in amendment No. 16, I sought to extend the time provided for in the new section 5A of the principal Act from 21 days to 30 days. From my experience of ordinary planning, I am conscious of how short a time 35 days is in which to respond. It usually takes a couple of weeks to study the impact a development might have in one's constituency. There is very little time in which to respond. I deplore this in ordinary planning. Similarly, in the context of the marine environment, I wanted to allow more scope for submissions. In amendment No. 17, I seek to increase the time allowed from one month to 42 days to allow the maximum amount of time for interested parties to make submissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">It is difficult to track developments. The Minister of State has already tabled a number of amendments that relate to the timeframe for making submissions and for the publication of information. However, there is still scope for the greatest possible democratic practice and the greatest possible transparency. I represent a constituency in which a new city is being built and where monumental developments are planned. A public representative has very little time or resources to monitor these and put up the best case on behalf of citizens. Conscious of that, I ask the Minister of State to provide the greatest possible leeway in policing the marine environment. I urge him to accept my amendments and those of Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p>

          <p eId="para_914">Amendment No. 12 seeks to delete lines 40 to 52 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_915">"(3) A person may, in writing, within——</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_916">(<i>a</i>) in the case of proposed dredging, over a period of not more than 12 months, for the maintenance of navigable depths, 21 days, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_917">(<i>b</i>) in any other case, 1 month,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_918">after the date on which a notice under subsection (1) is published, make a submission or observations to the Minister about the proposal.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_919">(4) A person may not make a submission under subsection (3) in a case of dredging which, in the opinion of the Minister, is urgently required for the purposes of navigational safety and is specified in a notice under subsection (1) to be of an urgent nature.".</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Subsection (3) of the new section 5A as inserted by the Bill is unusual in that it sets out the exception first and then the rule. That seems contrary to logic. It would surely make more sense to alert people to the rule before setting out exceptions to it. I hope the Minister of State will accept my amendment. If he examines it carefully, he will see that I have altered the form and not the substance of the subsection. I concur with Deputies Eamon Ryan and Broughan regarding their amendments to which I will return later.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_460" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_921">This amendment is opposed. The period of 21 days specified in the Bill allows applicants sufficient time to arrange to place the required public notice in a local newspaper and to arrange with the Garda Síochána for the deposit of documentation for public viewing in Garda stations. It also allows the Department time to assess whether there are any substantial errors or omissions in the application which should be rectified prior to its being put forward formally for public consultation. Fourteen days would not be sufficient for these purposes. Details of all applications for dumping at sea are posted on the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources website on receipt and are therefore immediately accessible to interested persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">As on Committee Stage, I am opposing amendment No. 5 as it is not considered necessary for notice of every permit application to be published in a national as well as a local newspaper, which is the primary medium. Moreover, apart from giving rise to unnecessary expense, such a requirement ignores the immediate posting of details of the application on the Department's website, which will ensure that any interested person anywhere can access that information immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Regarding a test case, departmental officials met representatives of the Shannon Foynes Port Company in February 2004 to discuss various technical issues regarding the port company's proposed application to dispose of material from maintenance dredging from 2004 to 2008. At that meeting, it was agreed that the Shannon Foynes Port Company's application should be used as a test case for the new requirements regarding public notices. The decision to publish a notice in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 15 March 2004, a national rather than a local newspaper, was taken owing to the fact that dredging would take place in both Limerick Port and Foynes.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">One of the issues raised on Committee Stage was how the dredging of Foynes might impact on local business and the marine environment in County Clare, as Deputy Broughan has said. It was also to allow for the widest possible notice to access its impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">It should also be noted that the public notice allows for a period of one calendar month for comments from members of the public, as specified in the Bill. The cost of publishing the notice was approximately €4,800. However, it is likely that other such notices in a local newspaper only will be less expensive. Drogheda Port Company published a similar notice in a local newspaper for a proposed capital dredging project at Tom Roes Point. The national newspaper was used in one area at a cost of €4,800. The local newspaper in Drogheda was also used, since it dealt specifically with that town. I do not have the figure but I know that the cost was substantially less.</p>

It is very valuable that we are to get a map showing the relationship with positions on land, with the general location very clearly set out for everyone to see, along with the methods of the proposed dredging and dumping. Once again, I commend the Minister of State on being so forthcoming in listening to the Opposition on important amendments.</p>

The drafting by the Parliamentary Counsel of the new section 5A(6) is in accordance with best practice and it is clear as to its purpose. The Deputy has not proposed any change of substance.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">Amendments Nos. 14, 15, 19 and 20 are a response to issues raised by Deputies on Committee Stage. They are proposed to section 5A(3) and 5A(6) to require publication in a national newspaper of notice of urgent dredging required for purposes of navigational safety and to require in that notice to give a reason or reasons for the urgency advanced. This would help port companies, for example, to identify and address quickly, within a day if necessary, and publicise genuinely urgent dredging requirements if they should arise. The amendment would allay suspicion that, for example, port companies would hold off until the last moment to identify a publicised urgent dredging requirement to bypass general public consultation requirements connected with dumping at sea permit applications.</p>

          <p eId="para_985">The Minister of State referred to amendment No. 21 regarding page 6, line 42, which has been agreed. I take it, therefore, that we are dealing only with amendment No. 22 here. In that regard I hoped that my amendment No. 23 would complement rather than contradict the Minister of State's amendment. I commend him on this amendment because it is an improvement and will lead to the greater openness that I mentioned previously, namely, the ability to track the various submissions lodged throughout an application. That is a very important principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">Does this amendment guarantee that a notice would be posted before a decision is made on the application, which is the intent of my amendment No. 23? If all this information is to be posted on a website it would be better done prior to a decision being made so the public may see the full case made for both sides. That would be more transparent and also provides a good check on the system because it allows developers at all times to see the submissions and who is saying what. It strengthens everyone's position when there is full clarity on the various applications made. Will the Minister of State reassure me that such notices would be posted prior to a final decision? If that is the case I am happy to accept the Minister of State's amendment without a further amendment. Otherwise, I will press my amendment, if I may.</p>

Are the submissions proposed by the developers similar to those made in the ordinary planning process? Would a situation arise whereby part of the process measures the environmental impact fairly precisely? The legislation makes some reference to this.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_997">"12.—Parties who have made an application for a permit or a submission to the Minister with regard to the application shall be able to appeal the decision of the Minister to An Bord Pleanála in accordance with their appeals procedure set out in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976.".</p>
          <p eId="para_998">Regardless of the procedures we put in place and the open way in which we go about our business, there may be certain applications that are approved in respect of which there should be a facility of appeal. Members of the public or others who have a concerned interest in respect of a particular application should have access to some appeals procedure that allows them to have a decision reviewed. Given the lack of any other appeals procedure, I put forward this amendment which suggests that An Bord Pleanála, in accordance with the existing legislation that governs its actions, would be a suitable body to conduct any such appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">In debates about An Bord Pleanála, the Taoiseach recently stated that attempts are being made to reduce the length of time appeals take and that massive investment will be made in the planning appeals system so that there will not be delays. In that light, I do not believe that what is suggested in the amendment would cause major delays for those making applications. We are discussing what can sometimes be significant decisions involving millions of tonnes of material which can have a profound effect on the environment and there is a requirement for some appeals procedure regarding the applications that are made.</p>

          <p eId="para_1000">I support the thrust of the amendment. In a procedure under which members of the public have made submissions and decisions have been made, there should be one last opportunity to make appeals. I do not completely share Deputy Eamon Ryan's confidence in An Bord Pleanála and I refer in this regard to a number of decisions that have been made in respect of the northern fringe. As regards the latter, I do not believe that the views of public representatives were taken into account to any great degree. However, I do not know what other route one would take in terms of putting in place an appeals mechanism. What this matter comes down to is ministerial diktat or power and I am glad the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present to hear my comments in that regard. Some mechanism should be put in place under which people could make appeals.</p>

Such systems apply in respect of all other applications people are obliged to make and the position should be no different in respect of this area. The Department should explore the possibility of putting in place an appeals mechanism to facilitate those who make applications and are refused.</p>

          <p eId="para_1003">I accept what the Deputies are saying but I do not believe An Bord Pleanála would be an appropriate body to oversee an appeals system in this regard. The remit of An Bord Pleanála is set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000. The question of appeals arrangements in respect of the marine coastal zone will be considered in detail in the context of the new legislation on integrated coastal zone management. Deputy Broughan is forever criticising us for the delays in introducing that legislation. It would be appropriate to consider the introduction of an appeals mechanism in the context of the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1006">Any permit granted under the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 is subject to review by the Minister at any time. In instances where problems might arise, I am sure the Minister would not hesitate to amend or revoke a permit if he should have cause to do so. It would seem more appropriate to include an appeals mechanism in the integrated coastal zone management legislation.</p>

That may be a sign that it is truly independent. In light of the Minister of State's agreement that some appeals system is necessary, would it not be appropriate, on an interim basis, to use the An Bord Pleanála appeals mechanism? We could easily amend matters in the coastal zone management legislation.

The second part of the amendment seeks to ensure that the Minister, where a dumping permit has been applied for, would have real powers in terms of directing companies on how to treat the hazardous spoil that would result from dumping. The Department may well have such conditions. I was looking at it in terms of publishing a report as to when a permit is needed.

If the council dug up a hole in the road and somebody fell into it, a claim could be made but if the hole wore away through time or otherwise, one could not claim. I have some vague recollection that the difference was to be abolished by ministerial order but I do not recollect that order ever having been made.

          <p eId="para_1036">Some of these provisions will require some time for preparation. Part 2 in regard to civil liability is clearly one area which, in some cases, will require advance notice to litigants and the like because of the use of new summonses, new procedures and so on. I cannot give an exact time as to when they will come into effect but the very fact that I moved to get this done now rather than later indicates that I very much want to get this new procedure into effect as soon as possible. I will confer with the Courts Service as soon as I can to get the bulk of the provisions of the Bill into operation as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1048">It is a pity we are rushing this legislation. I have not had time to collect my thoughts or properly study the amendments since Committee Stage was only taken yesterday. During Committee Stage the Bills office rang me looking for Report Stage amendments even though Committee Stage had not been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">I wish to press this amendment and argue strongly that medical cases should be treated differently to other cases. The Minister has suggested a two-year limitation. I suggest it should either be left as it is or we should consider a system similar to the British one. When I raised this matter on Committee Stage, I did not hear what the Minister had to say on the different British system for medical negligence cases, which is basically the subject of this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">Anybody who has been through medical negligence cases will attest that delays occur. Reports are often not forthcoming for various reasons, sometimes due to misguided loyalty between doctors or because they have not had time to prepare the reports. People may seek medical reports even when not intending to take legal action or seek compensation. They do so to find out what went wrong, or what is wrong with them or their relatives. They basically seek total disclosure, which can take a long time, after which medical experts must look at the reports to determine whether there is a possible case of negligence. It is then necessary to find a solicitor to determine what charge can be brought against the hospital, doctor or even dentist. That all takes time and two years is a limited time in medical terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">We have received submissions from various groups and individuals, including one today from a woman in Cork who highlighted the length of time taken in the case of her son. If a two-year deadline had existed, she would not have been ready within that time. Patient Focus made a submission. Some individuals and solicitors raised specific questions on this aspect. The Law Society made a substantial submission on the Bill pointing out that in complex cases it may not be feasible to obtain expert reports within 24 months, as provided for in the Bill, and that this could place a solicitor in an invidious position of "having to issue proceedings in order to protect the client's interest, but potentially in a manner contrary to the judicial pronouncements as to best practice". Basically a solicitor might have to opt for a half-baked case rather than waiting until the details, reports and expert opinion have been gleaned. In those circumstances the extra 12 months should be allowed, but only in this specific instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">On Committee Stage, I gave the example of a rape victim deciding to initiate civil proceedings. It can take a victim months or years to come to terms with such a traumatic event and some might never do so. In those cases time would be running out under the Statute of Limitations. In such cases, waiting for the Director of Public Prosecutions to take criminal proceedings impacts on the Statute of Limitations. At the very least the time taken by the DPP to consider taking a criminal case should not be taken out of the two years within which a person can take a civil case. Otherwise as the Minister said, everybody who has been wronged will both expect the State to take a criminal prosecution in cases of rape or serious assault and, at the same time, their solicitors will recommend initiating civil proceedings, which would result in the court system getting clogged up and could mean two cases running concurrently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The Minister should accept the amendment. At the very least the Statute of Limitations in medical cases should be three years. Especially in the case of those who have lost loved ones, this would allow time to get over their grief, get their heads in order, get the medical reports and study them before having to be rushed into taking a case which they might not want to do. The extra year will allow them to take a decision in an informed manner and allow the solicitors put the case properly. While some cases will go outside that deadline, most cases will be able to be progressed properly within those three years by solicitors and the individuals who have been wronged.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1054">We are discussing one of the remaining controversial points left in the Bill. Most would agree that the proposal to reduce the three-year limitation period for personal injury claims in general was sensible. The Minister's initial proposal was to reduce it to one year. While groups such as the Alliance for Insurance Reform would have been very happy with one year, I felt that was too tight. Two years is a reasonable compromise and I am glad the Minister was prepared to accept our compromise proposal in the Seanad, which is where the Bill now stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">One issue remains outstanding, which is the claims for medical negligence. While I have no desire to focus particularly on doctors, medical negligence claims are peculiar in nature. A strong case can be made for treating medical negligence claims in a different category to ordinary claims for personal injury. Even the Alliance for Insurance Reform has accepted the distinction between medical negligence actions and other actions for personal injury. Having agreed on two years as the normal limitation period beyond which personal injury actions should not be brought, should we make special provision for medical negligence claims? I believe there is a strong case for doing so, which is why I tabled the amendment to allow three years for such claims and the amendments in the names of my colleagues in the House are along the same lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">A precedent exists in the Personal Injury Assessment Board Bill, where it is accepted that medical negligence claims cannot go before the PIAB because medical cases are in a separate category. It is clear and common case that such claims are far more complex and difficult. They are difficult from the point of view of the patient who becomes the claimant, the date of knowledge, but the Minister could make a counter argument that it would provide extra time, but that is a grey area sometimes. The main difficulty in regard to such claims — I say this as somebody who practised law for many years — is the reluctance of other doctors to provide evidence against colleagues, which is understandable. There is a difficulty in obtaining hospital records — in some instances it could involve a number of hospitals and there is a difficulty in ascertaining what doctor may have been involved in the negligence. There could be a series of doctors involved in treating a particular medical or surgical condition. There are significant difficulties in compiling the evidence, in getting the records, and that can cause all sorts of delays.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">There are cases before the court which the Supreme Court judges have decided that it was an abuse of the process of the courts to issue proceedings in a situation where the lawyers have not assembled the evidence so that they are satisfied with the grounds for making allegations of negligence. There are a number of cases where that has been so found.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Lawyers may be placed in a very difficult situation where there is inadequate time, where on the one hand, in spite of their best efforts, there are difficulties in gathering and collating the records, information and evidence and, on the other hand, they are bound by judicial stricture not to issue proceedings in a situation until all that work has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The Minister has been resisting the suggestion to date that there should be a special limitation period for medical negligence. I am not sure that position is sustainable because I think the Minister accepts that such claims fall into a separate category. He merely accepts what everybody else accepts. If they fall into a separate category, should there not be a separate period of time for dealing with them? That is the net issue. The basis for tabling the amendment is to allow the existing time limit to continue to apply to cases in that special category, while at the same time reducing the time limit for all other cases. That is the net point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">The Law Society has taken a constructive approach to the Bill. Many of the proposals in the Bill emanate from the Law Society, but it has indicated considerable concerns on this score. These concerns have been articulated and enunciated by bodies such as Patient Focus. This is the last opportunity for debating and arguing the point. I think the case for a special period of limitations for medical negligence claims is well made and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_525">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1061">I support the amendment tabled by Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Jim O'Keeffe. My amendment is on the same lines. The first amendment is very similar to a suggested wording from the Law Society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">Concerns on the shortage of time to deal with cases of medical negligence have been expressed by Patient Focus and individuals, who have contacted us, as well as the legal profession. It is particularly convincing when an individual goes through the detail of the difficulties encountered in dealing with a case of medical negligence. Something that I had not considered before is the tremendous reluctance to breach the patient-doctor relationship and the trust that has been built up. The general practitioner is generally the family doctor and nobody expects the family doctor to be negligent. Nobody expects when he or she goes to hospital that the consultant, the surgeon or aspects of the nursing care might be negligent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">We hear stories of people lying on trolleys, which is an aspect of our hospital and medical system at present. Nobody expects medical negligence in his or her case. It is with great reluctance that patients come to the conclusion that they suffered from medical negligence and they will delay the evil day of dealing with the matter. We are talking about vulnerable ill people who expect nothing but the very best from the medical services. This is different from an accident in the workplace or on the street, where there is an immediate crisis, The cause of the accident is known immediately as well as the person who is culpable. That can be dealt with straight away. It is clear and simple.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">However, medical negligence, can cover individual practitioners, general practitioners, a number of hospitals and a number of consultants. It could be a combined case against a general practitioner, a consultant and so on, yet we are expected to accept that in all cases a two-year limit would apply. The more I see it, the more I am convinced that this is a different category and different considerations are being brought to bear in terms of knowledge, when people came to know about the matter and how he or she will deal with it. It is more desirable to provide for an extra year to ensure that one does not end up down the road with further litigation as to whether the Statute of Limitations was breached. That is what will happen. A number of cases may not be dealt with in the timeframe and the insurance industry will argue that the statute of limitations has been breached. The defendant in the case will argue the point and in the circumstance may have a deep pocket and will argue the case in so far as he or she can.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">I do not think it desirable to put into legislation the conflict that will inevitably come about between the plaintiff and the defendant because of the shortage of time. A claim is regarded as invalid unless there are apparent bone fide valid grounds for proceeding with it and there is existing case law. The legal team must have all the arguments together before beginning the case. Because of the streamlining of the legislation and the procedures, the new personal injuries summons that is being put in place in lieu of a normal claim, there should be specific and detailed information to speed up the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">That will make it even more difficult in the case of medical negligence where there are complex and technical issues and a number of individuals involved all of whom may well deny any negligence at all. The letter from the lady in Cork says that "eventually, as time went by the outcome of the case was that two general practitioners, one private consultant, one hospital consultant and a hospital all admitted liability". This resulted in a settlement and so on. It was resisted right up to the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">It is difficult for a patient who certainly did not expect to take a course of action that would lead to the courts, to put such a case together within a two-year period. To expect that, and for any lawyer to be able to deal with the different agencies and persons within the timeframe, is to expect too much. It is to expect too much of particularly vulnerable people such as patients, in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">This section stacks the cards unnecessarily against the plaintiff and will lead to expensive litigation that will not be in his or her interests. It will do nothing to improve the personal injuries compensation structure. I had accepted initially that the Minister had come up with a compromise of two years instead of either one or three and that this would be a type of umbrella period to cover all instances and would, perhaps, be the best way to go. I am not so sure now that this is the case. Within this section is a presumption that the real problem is the plaintiff. It is assumed that a bona fide plaintiff can get his or her act together within a certain timeframe and that a compensation culture exists which requires a particularly streamlined procedure. It is presumed therefore that the procedure will weed out all of the cases which are not bona fide. That is not the case and the presumption is wrong. As a result it will lead to much suffering, litigation and costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">It is desirable that the Minister would have a rethink of this, even at this late stage. We are only talking about medical negligence, an area which has been left outside the PIAB, as has already been recognised in the distinction between medical and clinical negligence cases and other personal injuries. I do not see why it could not be reflected in this legislation as well because of the complexity, the potential abuse of the process and the difficulty of putting cases together, whether it is the general practitioner's records or hospital files, and the totality of people to be dealt with. The Minister should acknowledge that when legislation is passed in this House it is enacted in the interests of the ordinary citizen in the street. I do not believe this legislation will be other than to the detriment of the ordinary citizen, who falls on hard ways and has to take legal action to redress an injustice that was done, in the area of personal injury in medical negligence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_526" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1070">This issue has been thoroughly canvassed in both Houses of this Parliament and has been dealt with exhaustively. I set out at considerable length on Committee Stage yesterday the reasons these amendments are mistaken. Perhaps now I can encapsulate them because it should be done on the floor of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">First, it should be remembered that the law of civil liability here is not the same as it was when the three-year limit was restated for personal injuries actions in 1961. At that time the rule of discoverability was different, as a matter of law, from the present situation. In the interim the law has been amended as regards limitation on liability by reference to time to provide that the accrual of a cause of action for the purposes of the three-year, or any other, limit, runs from the date of discoverability. That is the later of two dates, either the date on which the wrongful act occurred or alternatively, the date on which the injured party had actual knowledge of the injury done to him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">It must be emphasised that as regards medical negligence cases, that radically changed the law in a way which was pro-plaintiff. It meant that if a botched operation was done on a person, the clock was not ticking away at a time when the person had no knowledge of the negligence which led to the operation going wrong. The law was changed to say that the plaintiff had to have actual knowledge of the injury done. That is an objective test, and not entirely subjective, because it is fixed at the point at which a reasonable person would become aware of the negligence affecting him or her. That does not mean that if someone comes out of hospital feeling ill as a result of an illness, an operation or whatever, a treatment or non-treatment, as the case may be, that the clock is ticking away for two years or for three. It is necessary for the plaintiff to be fixed with a type of knowledge that effectively meant there was a basis for making a claim. We have had a number of cases here. However, in the case of someone who comes out of hospital ill, after an operation, and does not realise that a swab or instrument was left inside or that his or her bowel was sutured in a way that involved other organs, it does not mean that the clock is ticking from that day. It is when the plaintiff discovers that is the case, or ought to have discovered it to be the case, with reasonable care, that the clock starts ticking against him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">Let us remember that from 1961 to 2004, a 43-year period, for the great majority of that time the law held that the clock could start ticking against a plaintiff at a time when he or she was unaware that there was a cause of action. Now there is a different situation. The limitation period runs from a different date — a date of discoverability, which is later. That is an important point to take into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">The second point I made yesterday on Committee Stage, before the Select Committee of Dáil Éireann and I will reiterate it now. As regards actions of this kind there is a deadline of some kind. It is of the nature of a limitation statute that it must be fixed and definite. I could well imagine if it was three years that people would argue it should be five years and there were difficulties which could emerge in the second and third years which would warrant such an extension. It may be argued that any limitation period is, in one sense, arbitrary, but it must be definite.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">The third point I made yesterday, which I reiterate today, is that many actions are a combination of medical negligence and personal injuries. I refer, for example, to a person who is run over by a bus and then sues not only the bus company but also the doctor who treated him or her. Such people claim that they have a shortened leg, or whatever, as a result of a combination of both events.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_527">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1076">That is definitely my amendment then.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_528" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1077">They argue that the doctor treated the case in a negligent manner. It would be wrong if a simple car crash which does not lead to a medical negligence case had a different period of limitation to a car crash which is complicated by the additional question of whether medical negligence was involved. In such circumstances, I do not see how it would be correct to have a different period of limitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">What limitation period should apply in the case of a person who makes a joint claim against a motorist and a doctor, arising from the manner in which a set of injuries was inflicted and treated? Should one be able to make a claim against the motorist outside the two-year period because one has also made a claim for medical negligence against the doctor for the manner in which one's injury was treated in hospital?</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">Should the period in which the motorist is open to a claim be extended from two to three years because the doctor ill-treated the victim of the motorist's negligence? Is that a sensible way in which to proceed? I do not think it is. I do not think it is a good idea to have such a twilight zone whereby one has an additional year in which to make a personal injuries claim if one includes medical negligence in the claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">An alternative view of the law is that one should commence two separate sets of proceedings arising from the same injury — against the motorist within two years and against the doctor within three years. I do not think that is a good way to construct our law. There should be a common period. The only issue should be whether we should provide for two or three years in which claims can be made. I accepted amendments in the Seanad based on the submissions that were made by Senators on the propriety of a two-year or three-year period. I believe that two years is the apt period for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">I wish to discuss the propositions which will involve a fundamental change in the civil liability law when we introduce the discoverability test. The test applies particularly to medical negligence claims. One knows when one has been run down, but one may not know that one has been badly or negligently treated until somebody tells one how the way in which one was treated departs from ordinary standards of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Quite apart from such considerations, one also has to bear in mind another aspect of civil liability law. Subject to the ordinary law of delay, a person who is acting under a disability, particularly a person aged 18 or less, has far greater latitude in when he or she can bring a claim. Similarly, victims of sexual violence and abuse are entitled to an extension of the limitation period, by reference to an inability to commence proceedings due to psychological or emotional trauma resulting from the injury itself. Such people are given additional time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">A great deal of statutory changes have been made to our law, many of which are pro-plaintiff. In this context, the balance has been struck rightly. As a matter of principle, it is generally right to keep the same period for medical negligence cases and personal injuries cases. We should retain a single period for both types of personal injury. It is true that medical negligence is more difficult to tee up and that it is frequently discovered later than industrial accidents, car crashes or cases of a person falling down the stairs. It is blindingly obvious to the plaintiff in most such cases that he or she has suffered injuries and that liability may lie with somebody else who acted negligently. As the discoverability issue looms large in all of this, it is appropriate to have one statutory period for both types of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">Although medical negligence cases are serious, they cut both ways. Defensive medicine, which is practised because of people's increasing propensity to make claims of negligence against doctors, is not an unalloyed positive feature in the practice of medicine. Doctors should be careful and should comply with proper medical standards. Practitioners of defensive medicine refuse to do the common sense thing because they feel there is a risk that they may be sued afterwards. It is a serious enough matter. During the debate on the Bill in the Seanad, Senator Henry agreed with me that it is by no means pleasant for doctors to have a long period of limitation hanging over them after initial letters are sent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">It has been correctly suggested in this House that it is sometimes difficult to identify precisely a doctor who was involved in a complex series of medical steps and who may or may not have been guilty of negligence. The emergence of enterprise liability as it is now being operated means, in effect, that hospitals are taking responsibility for all the treatment afforded to those receiving care from them. The difficulty mentioned by Deputies — ascertaining precisely which intern performed a medical function and whether he or she has emigrated since then — is receding as a result. It is not as significant as it used to be because an enterprise liability approach is being taken to defending such claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">Although I have considered the arguments made in the Seanad, the Dáil and the committee, I have not changed my opinion. As a matter of principle, the same period should be provided for all personal injuries actions, regardless of whether they are medical negligence cases. If that were not the case, the amendments that have been tabled today would need to be radically altered to provide for the limitation period that would apply to mixed claims. That would create serious anomalies in itself. The balance that was struck when I accepted Senator Terry's amendment, which took medical negligence cases into account and was based on the argument I have made, is the correct balance. If I may say so, the approach taken in the Seanad was correct. This House should abide by the wisdom of the reflective Senators who wisely chose to table the amendment in question.</p>

          <p eId="para_1087">It is not long since the Minister believed that one year would be the proper period for making claims. Such a period was originally provided for in the legislation. Perhaps we are not as reflective as the Senators mentioned by the Minister and cannot, therefore, persuade him to accept that a period of three years should be provided for.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1089">I have not heard anyone on this side of the House making the case for a period of five years. Three years would be reasonable. If a solicitor is unable to put together a case within three years, he or she must be trying to argue a complex and substantial case. One need only examine the Neary and Army deafness cases to appreciate that it takes many years to put cases together, especially if a number of hospitals and doctors are involved. People do not set out to seek compensation. They try to find out what went wrong. It is often only when they come up against an obstacle or hospitals which delay the release of reports that they get frustrated, decide not to accept that and take a case against the hospital or doctor involved. Now that hospitals are covered by enterprise liability, doctors should not practise defensive medicine because the hospital is giving them full cover to practice medicine properly. Doctors who avoid taking proper decisions leave hospitals open to medical negligence claims because they did not take the correct procedure at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">The aspect I raised concerned the Lord Woolf reforms in the United Kingdom which provide specific rules for courts to deal with medical negligence cases. It is a module of civil procedure rules designed to deal specifically with medical negligence claims. Given the similarities between our two judicial codes, why can we not introduce a similar module in the Irish context? The Minister cited the cases involving car accidents and so on, but in the majority of cases medical negligence claims can be set to one side and dealt with separately.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_532">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1091">The Minister admits that medical negligence claims are more difficult to tee up, to use his own expression. The onus is on him to justify reducing the time limit for medical negligence claims from its current limit of three years. The Minister has made a case for a reduction by one year in respect of general personal injuries claims. I felt, having discussed it with my colleague, Senator Terry, when she tabled amendment in the Seanad, that two years was a reasonable compromise and that a case had been made to reduce it to what I thought was a fair time limit of two years. The Minister has not justified reducing the time limit for medical negligence claims and the onus is on him in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">The date of knowledge provision will not add any significant time to the limitation period as far as such claims are concerned. In general, the complexities do not arise from the date of knowledge. That can be the case on occasions but they arise from the situation I outlined earlier on obtaining the data, reports and so on. I accept there must be a time limit on medical negligence claims but if the onus has not been discharged for reducing it, we should leave it as it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The Minister made a point about mixed claims, and he is well able to argue a point. The same issue arises in respect of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The distinction was drawn between the bus company and the doctor. The two year limit applies to the bus company and the three years applies to the doctor. I do not see that as a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">The Minister said it is not pleasant for doctors to have such claims hanging over them. I accept that. It is not pleasant for anybody, particularly someone in a professional position who is rendering services, to have such claims hanging over them. As to whether that will lead to defensive medicine or that the reduction in the time limit will make any difference, I do not believe so because that case has not been proved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">The core point is that these claims fall into a separate category. The case for a reduction in respect of personal injury claims generally has been well made and we have accepted that. The case for a reduction in the time limit for medical negligence claims has not been made. On that basis, the current three-year time limit should stand and the amendment should be accepted by the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_533">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1096">I wonder if we are approaching some of these issues in the right way. I recently came across a newspaper report on a "Prime Time" programme broadcast by RTE in February entitled Bad Medicine in which it was suggested that 14,000 people were injured or killed in Irish hospitals by medical error but that only about 4% of these incidences resulted in claims. The programme's conclusion was that, with less time, there would be even fewer claims. That is an incredible statistic highlighted by the RTE "Prime Time" programme. Obviously a huge number of medical negligence issues never reach the courts and are not resolved one way or another, as well as the other personal injuries issues that are not resolved. We are probably only seeing the tip of the iceberg in many cases because it is a difficult matter to gather evidence, get proof and argue the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">It should be remembered that one must be specific in a personal injuries summons. One has to give full particulars of all items of special damage, the wrongful acts of the defendant, the circumstances of the wrong and each incidence of negligence. All of those must be included in the particulars and one must be quite sharp and conclusive with the information one has and have the case substantially put together, if not comprehensively, by the time the personal injuries summons is issued.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">I wish to quote from the Law Society of Ireland's summing up of its argument. It states: "A reduction in the limitation period to two years, as proposed by the Minister, will result in defendants arguing that cases are statute-barred in most, if not all, medical negligence cases." That is an extraordinary conclusion. It further states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1099">As a consequence, the litigation will be considerably prolonged and legal costs will be greatly increased. There will be trials within a trial involving exceptionally complex legal arguments under section 3 of 1991 Act centering around the concept of "date of knowledge" i.e. when did the patient know or ought to have known or had a real suspicion that he/she was injured as a result of the negligence of his/her doctor? This question will necessarily involve enquiries into what the patient could have learned had he/she had the benefit of expert legal and medical advice. Precisely when was it reasonable for the patient to seek such advice? When ought the patient have realised that his/her illness/injuries were not the result of natural illness that brought him/her to the doctor in the first place but rather were the result of improper treatment etc?</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">This is a very complex area which is obviously catastrophic for the patient. If we leave the time limit as tight as the Minister proposes, the legal arguments between the defendants, that is, the insurance companies, and the citizen who is complaining and looking for relief will probably be the end result.</p>

          <p eId="para_1103">If we proceed with a two-year time limit as opposed to the existing three-year limit, there will be many more precautionary claims from solicitors who have been contacted by individuals who believe they have been wronged. To ensure they remain within the Statute of Limitations while they do their research, access doctors' reports and so on, they should encourage their clients to proceed with claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">An increase in claims will lead to an increase in hospital costs because hospitals will have to defend themselves. I agree that many claims will fall and be withdrawn. However, many will be initiated with the available material the solicitor has rather than waiting the extra time to come up with the full facts and medical reports. The proposed timeframe is reasonable considering medical claims are highly complex and detailed and dependent on doctors' opinions and reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">Another factor depends on the patient's recovery. Some illnesses may fade with time, making a claimant more willing to withdraw a claim. As the saying goes, time is a great healer. In this instance, a solicitor on meeting a client will immediately initiate a precautionary claim. The judgment in the High Court case of Reidy <i>v</i>. National Maternity Hospital stated: “It is irresponsible and an abuse of the process of the court to launch a professional negligence action against institutions such as hospitals and professional personnel without first ascertaining that there are reasonable grounds for so doing.”</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">That judgment and the subsequent Supreme Court judgment in the Cooke <i>v</i>. Cronin and Neary case would prevent a solicitor from protecting his or her client’s interests, even if the full documentation was not available. Three years is a reasonable time in which to expect a solicitor to receive all papers from doctors and hospitals, who sometimes can purposefully delay their release. The three year period would also allow for proper contemplation of the case. By abandoning the three year proposal, the court system will be overloaded and it will cost hospitals and medical practitioners more money in the long run.</p>

          <p eId="para_1119">As the process will be streamlined, this amendment is an extension of the last one. I propose that to get the process up and running, the period for an initial letter of claim should be raised from two months to three months. The claimant is expected not to make an invalid or non-bona fide claim but a substantial one. Two months is extremely short and can be unrealistic in the majority of cases, considering the complexity of certain personal injury claims, the difficulty in getting files and knowing for sure that a personal injury can be acted on. While an initial letter of claim is not the same as a personal injury summons, a three-month period would seem to be realistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">One danger of the two-month timeframe is that when a plaintiff is recovering from his or her injuries, he or she might not be in a position to lodge a statement of claim. It seems reasonable to give a more realistic period for this process. Another danger is of a plaintiff simply panicking and heading straight to a lawyer to get a statement of claim in anyway. Whereas it cannot be done properly in a two-month period, a three-month period would give a more reasoned time for issuing an initial letter of claim in a significant and measured fashion. As the rest of the procedures are to be speeded up and the personal injury summons will contain all the details, the initial claim period should be reasonable so a claimant can properly and realistically initiate a claim.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1124">On Committee Stage yesterday, an amendment was tabled to provide for two months, or as soon as practicable thereafter, which improved the Bill and I was glad it was acceptable. The two basic principles to this amendment are whether there should be a requirement for a letter of claim and the period in which it should be served. A letter of claim is a good idea as inferences could be drawn if one is not issued. One complaint I often receive from employers and the insurance industry is that as they are often hit by an out-of-the-blue claim ages after the incident, they have no opportunity of properly investigating the claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">What period should be prescribed for such letters of claim? Two months is rather tight. The Bill is improved by the amendment where the court will be allowed to say that two months was not practicable in cases where the claimant, not realising the seriousness of the injury, had not seen any great urgency in going to a solicitor. That improves the situation but it could be further improved by the three month period. It is not a do or die situation but the two month period is a little tight. Accordingly I support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1126">I support my two colleagues on this matter. The situation can be further improved by means of the three month period. The fact that the Minister had the wrong copy of the Bill shows the rushed nature of this debate. It is a pity it has been rushed and that nearly half the amendments on Report Stage come from the Minister. That indicates haste, and such situations will continue if the Minister continues to redraft Bills on Committee Stage and redraft them again on Report Stage. Of the 55 or 56 amendments we have today, 26 are tabled by the Minister. That indicates he is trying to correct mistakes. They may be technical but they should have been spotted before the Bill was presented on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_1127">I disagree with that proposition. The fact that I have tabled amendments shows that I am listening to what is going on and taking on board the points made. If I suggested no changes, I could imagine an equally strong speech being made to suggest that while we go through days of debate, the Minister never tables any amendments. Regarding the wrong Bill, I was holding a proof in my hand rather than the finished item.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">The amendment I accepted yesterday and which we drew up on Committee Stage changes the tone of this section. It suggests that if someone goes to a solicitor outside the period in question, the duty on the solicitor to ensure that the plaintiff complies with the requirement to give early notice to the defendant of the likelihood of a claim is extended to whatever time is practicable. That is a reasonable amendment and in those circumstances it would not send the right signal to extend it from two months to three months.</p>

          <p eId="para_1132">This amendment is tabled to make the deterrent penalty more realistic in terms of cost. It is quite unrealistic to suggest that a plaintiff should not be entitled to any costs simply because he or she failed to issue a letter of claim on time or at all.

          <p eId="para_1133">The Minster is presenting it as a black or white matter but it would be better if there were an assessment of the amount that the plaintiff would be entitled to and that this assessment would not be the entire cost or would not be inferred as such in all cases, but that it would be assessed with regard to what the additional costs or losses might be. That would be more realistic.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1134">Let us be clear about what is required here. If somebody without reasonable cause fails to deliver this letter within two months, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the court can, where the interests of justice so require — a high hurdle — either make no order as to costs for the plaintiff or deduct some amount from the plaintiff's costs. I do not see how this is a black and white situation. It means that there would have to be an unreasonable failure to carry it out not merely within the two month period but within such a longer period as is reasonably practicable. The court would then have to conclude that the interests of justice required it to penalise the plaintiff in costs, after which the court would be in a position to choose either to make no order as to costs in favour of the plaintiff or, alternatively, to take away some amount of the plaintiff's costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">I do not see how this is black or white, or draconian. First, the court has to be compelled to the view that the interests of justice require it to make deduction of costs. If it is not so convinced, the measure does not come into effect. Second, the court can do anything it considers appropriate, from taking 1 cent off the plaintiff's costs to disallowing the whole of the plaintiff's cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">This is not a black or white arrangement. It gives the court wide latitude. I find it difficult to imagine circumstances where the interests of justice would require the total disallowance of the plaintiff's costs. However, there could be a case where a plaintiff's solicitor wilfully decided to inconvenience the defendant or allow the defendant, for example, to destroy or make unavailable evidence, or circumstances where there was sheer badmindedness and a lack of professionalism. In such circumstances, the Bill states that the court could disallow all of the plaintiff's costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">However, the plaintiff's decree for damages would be unaffected by this. It would apply only where the interests of justice required that the plaintiff's costs be reduced or disallowed. It is not a black or white situation and I am not arguing for such. I am saying a full spectrum is available, from doing nothing to disallowing costs in their entirety. However, this spectrum is only available to a court which decides that the interests of justice require some action of that kind to be taken and then only in certain circumstances where there was a departure from a fairly liberally phrased duty without reasonable cause. If I water this down any further, it will cease to mean anything.</p>

          <p eId="para_1138">I do not understand the Minister's logic. My amendment suggests that the court would "deduct from any costs payable to the plaintiff such amount, if any, of additional costs as in the opinion of the court has been incurred by the late service or non-service of a letter of claim". People have a period of two months in which to lodge a claim. It is only when that period has been exceeded and the claim has not arrived that the meter should begin to run.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1139">That is not the real issue. To take an example, a solicitor may be acting for a plaintiff in a case and may allow one year and 11 months before notifying the defendant of a pending claim, without any reasonable cause. If, during that period, the defendant does not, for example, get an engineer's report or changes a factory machine or the layout of a premises or otherwise, and the solicitor for the plaintiff allows all this to happen, the court can award the defendant damages. This is because, while the court agrees the defendant was injured as claimed, it was the solicitor, through his or her misbehaviour, who put the defendant at a total disadvantage in fighting the claim. By failing to give the defendant any notice in time, the solicitor allowed the defendant effectively to alter the premises, discard evidence or prejudice himself or herself in a number of ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">This is not just a matter of what extra cost the defendant was put to but that the plaintiff should be punished for acting in a way that puts the defendant at an unfair disadvantage by reason of the plaintiff's failure to give adequate notice in advance. The amendment is predicated on the notion that extra costs are being disallowed by reason of delay, which is not the case. It is that the defendant's capacity to fight the case fairly could be prejudiced by the plaintiff simply giving no notice until a considerable time had elapsed.</p>

The Minister now comes the heavy on somebody who does not serve notice within that period and says that the court may decide to give that person nothing in regard to costs. I believe this should be proportionate to the degree a plaintiff could argue a case. Arguments could be put forward in regard to a case and, if the meter does start running when the two months have elapsed, this would be the appropriate time because the deterrent is very much a sledgehammer in this instance. However, I will not press the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1146">We debated this amendment at some length on Committee Stage. As I pointed out, the thrust of the amendment is to some extent to redress the imbalance in the Bill against the plaintiff. The presumption in the Bill is that the plaintiff is at fault in not following procedures and may well be questionable in regard to his or her bona fides in the context of the compensation culture. If we are to impose strictures on the plaintiff to produce documentation and a letter of claim within two months, we should have some imposition on the defendant to respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">The Minister responds to this by saying we cannot do this to the defendant because the defendant cannot know how he or she will react to the case and may need more time to assess it. However, are we really streamlining the process if the letter of claim has set out the content of the claim, yet no response is required from the defendant and there is no time limit for the defendant to produce his or her response? Will the defendant accept that there is a case to answer or will he or she not have to respond at any stage until the case comes to court? If we want to streamline the procedure, we should impose some parameters on both sides — plaintiff and defendant — regarding each other, and, within two months, require some response from the defendant as to whether he or she will contest the case. Balance requires this approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_1150">On balance, it probably would not lead to a more expeditious delivery of justice and it could conceivably lead to injustice to the defendants. Even though insurance companies can be seen as easy targets, they have a job to do in running a business. It should also be borne in mind that some of these claims can be against people who have no insurance. We must be careful to get the balance right between both sides.

The proposed subsection (5) makes it clear that the function of the courts referred to in subsections (1) and (2) also applies to the Master of the High Court and a county registrar in the Circuit Court.</p>

The Bill, therefore, should make it clear that a statement of claim is unnecessary.

It specifically provides that the plaintiff should provide information but only in so far as it is reasonably available to him whereas the present formulation imposes a requirement on the plaintiff to provide information without any such qualification.

          <p eId="para_1175">The amendment relates to seeking the information that is specified in so far as it is reasonably available to the plaintiff. When one considers the amount of information that is required, one can see how difficult it is to have that information in its entirety. Section 11 provides that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1176">...the plaintiff shall provide the defendant with—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1177">(<i>a</i>) particulars of any personal injuries action brought by the plaintiff in which a court made an award of damages,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1178">(<i>b</i>) particulars of any personal injuries action brought by the plaintiff which was withdrawn or settled,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1179">(<i>c</i>) particulars of any injuries sustained or treatment administered to the plaintiff that would have a bearing on the personal injuries to which the personal injuries action relates, and</p>

          <p eId="para_1181">What is the situation if some information from the prescribed list is omitted? How is it dealt with? It is not just a request for further information but a demand for it. If there is not some degree of qualification, such as, that it be reasonably available or reasonable for the person to have and supply it, an injustice could be done in the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_1182">I draw the Deputy's attention to the sanctions available under subsection (3). Where a plaintiff fails to comply with a request under subsection (1), the court can direct that the personal injuries action can be effectively stayed until the plaintiff complies or, where it considers that the interests of justice so require, dismiss the plaintiff's action. In addition, the court shall take into account such failure when making an order as to the payment of the costs of the action. No negative consequences would apply to somebody who could argue that the information sought was not reasonably available to them. I do not believe a court could penalise somebody in those circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">Should the legislation not reflect that? The end result is that it would be a legal argument and the law would be quoted but there is no qualification within the law. Such qualifications are normally included as far as is practicable and reasonable. Where there is compulsion to produce information, some of which might not be reasonably available to the person, there should be a qualification in the law which would give direction to the court.</p>

          <p eId="para_1184">That would water down the effect of the legislation. Clear obligations are being imposed on the plaintiff. However, they are subject to the implication that nobody can be asked to do what would be impossible. The purpose of this is to make it clear to plaintiffs that they are expected as a matter of course to give particulars of previous actions for personal injuries which were withdrawn or settled, particulars of injuries which might have a bearing on the personal injuries to which the case relates, and the names of people from whom they received treatment. If I were to say this would not apply if the information were not reasonably available, people would argue about what the term "reasonably available" means. I would much prefer to leave this in its present form.</p>

          <p eId="para_1188">We debated this previously. Its thrust is the same as that of my previous amendments which is that there is an imbalance between what is required of the plaintiff and what is required of the defendant. We discussed the particulars a plaintiff must deliver in a personal injuries action upon request by a defendant. It appears that one party to an action is entitled to everything, all the information, the timescale and the procedures, but there is no corresponding onus on the defendant to provide the plaintiff with anything. The defendant is often an employer against whom an employee has taken an action for negligence, and there might well be information which would be of value to the plaintiff if it could be obtained from the defendant. Such information might relate to the defendant's behaviour, earnings, payments and so on. There is no onus on the defendant to produce such information. This amendment seeks to provide that upon the request of a plaintiff in a personal injuries action the defendant shall provide the plaintiff with full particulars.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">It seems the framers of the legislation did not envisage imposing responsibilities on defendants but sought to deal with the problem of fraud. The assumption is that the plaintiff is always a fraudster and the defendant, generally the insurance company, is the good agent. That features very strongly in this legislation and permeates it through to the end. The industry is very well served by this legislation. However, I am not so sure that the ordinary individual who has a case, whether for medical negligence or some other type of negligence, is getting a fair crack of the whip.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_580">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1190">My approach to this Bill has been to support any reasonable case for change but to ensure at all times that we keep a fair balance between plaintiffs and defendants. In opposing the "compo" culture it is possible to allow the pendulum to swing too far. It might be unfair to plaintiffs to have provisions in legislation which presuppose they are guilty of fraud before they even make a claim. In my experience most claimants are fair and reasonable and seek only their legal entitlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">This section introduces a new provision whereby the defendant can go on a trawling expedition and seek further information about other claims to effectively isolate somebody who is a professional claimant. That is not a bad idea and I support it. We do not want people making fraudulent claims in our courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">On the other hand, however, the defendant might be a rogue builder who has had many claims against him because he puts up crippled scaffolding and does not comply with procedures and regulations. A person who may have been badly injured in the course of his employment may be at a disadvantage in proving his case. The record of that employer in terms of breaches of health and safety regulations, breaches of statute in other respects, or regarding previous claims might be relevant in trying to secure a fair and just outcome. An action might involve a labourer with no great resources or education against a fairly substantial builder or employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">The kind of information to which Deputy Costello referred could be relevant to the claim. The proposed amendment refers to "such other information as may be reasonably requested by the plaintiff". If it is reasonable that the defendant should seek the claims record of a plaintiff with a view to proving that this is a professional claimant who must be dealt with with great circumspection, there is a case for providing that a defendant should provide information to a plaintiff where there is a reasonable suspicion that the defendant has a history of non-compliance with health and safety standards and has had claims brought against him for good reason.</p>

          <p eId="para_1194">I understand such questions are frequently put and are dealt with under the existing rules of court. I do not, therefore, believe the amendment is necessary. I am trying to deal with areas where there is controversy regarding what information should or should not be made available. Frequently plaintiffs bridle at being asked to give their previous claims record, details of their previous medical condition, or of the people who previously treated them, and the defendant is left wondering whether this is the first time they sought medical attention for their condition, whether this is the first instance of back pain, whether they were treated for back pain 20 or 30 years previously and whether they suffer from chronic back pain. There is no need to provide in this Bill for procedures which are currently dealt with under the rules of court. I am trying to introduce only new material that I believe necessary to redress the current imbalance between parties' rights. If a solicitor for the plaintiff wrote to the defendant asking for details of earnings for the past six months and the defendant refused, that person would be very seriously penalised regarding costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_1195">If the Minister is saying that the effects of my amendment are already included in the rules of court, why is he so specific with the plaintiff's duties? The plaintiff has very specific duties regarding the defendant that are laid out in the legislation. Surely under the rules of court one can similarly ask questions of the plaintiff without that being inserted in the legislation. It has been inserted in the legislation for a specific purpose. That the responsibilities of the defendant are left out of the legislation must equally be for a specific purpose. I have no problem with any of the obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">The provision states that on the request of a defendant, the plaintiff shall provide the defendant with documents. That is not a request but an obligation. It would cover any past records or history of claims. There might very well be documents regarding the Revenue or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs which are very relevant to what the plaintiff might want to know about the defendant and his or her activities. No matter what way we look at it, it seems that very little attempt has been made to hold the defendant accountable under the law in any similar or corresponding way and that is a pity. It could easily be incorporated in the Bill.</p>

If one asks whether he or she has ever been run down before on that road or fallen over the pothole in question, perhaps for the tenth time, the reply from the defendant is that it is not relevant to the claim and that the issue is whether he or she did or did not trip over the pothole. One is not entitled to particulars about other cases or events. The purpose of this section is that defendants are entitled to inquire into related events. At the moment, many plaintiffs simply refuse to answer such questions, saying that it is not relevant to their claim whether they made a similar one three years before. One can wonder about it and hire a detective if one believes that, but the plaintiffs refuse to answer the letter. That is the situation in which we find ourselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_1203">A generally bad safety record would not become relevant. For instance, if a CIE bus driver claims that he tripped on the stairs in the bus, it is not relevant to his claim that there are 3,000 or 8,000 claims outstanding against CIE. If we go down that road, we will be opening every case up into a general inquiry into the defendant's character. Bearing in mind the realities of our system of litigation, we must keep a narrow focus. However, it is directly relevant to many cases whether a plaintiff has tripped over potholes before. It is not really relevant for the plaintiff to ask Dublin Corporation how many potholes there are in the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">A false symmetry is being argued for here. As a plaintiff's solicitor, one can say that the streets of Dublin are in a disgraceful state and write letters to the city council asking it to disclose all the claims made against it right across Dublin in the previous three years by people who fell into potholes. One could say that it looks symmetrical to the right of the defendant to ask how many potholes he or she has fallen into. However, they are not the same issue, and it is a false symmetry to say that the defendant may ask roughly the same kinds of questions of the plaintiff as the plaintiff of the defendant.</p>

          <p eId="para_1205">The Minister may well have opened a Pandora's box. It might be very relevant to ask how many potholes in the local authority's jurisdiction citizens have fallen into. As the Chair and those of us who have recently been members of such authorities will know, the maintenance of pavements, closing potholes and so on, sometimes leaves much to be desired. If there is a track record in the local authority of very poor maintenance, it could be very relevant to the plaintiff, being contributory negligence. The Minister has imposed no corresponding onus of care on the part of the defendant to justify himself or herself or provide documentation that might well be relevant to the plaintiff. However, the poor plaintiff must disclose all particulars of any past or anything that might be relevant, and that leads to a degree of imbalance in the case. I entirely agree with requesting and demanding those particulars from the plaintiff, but there should also be a corresponding demand elsewhere.</p>

I accept the point regarding CIE or Bus Éireann that one cannot seek details of 8,000 claims being made against them for the past eight years. However, if someone is injured while working for a builder, the number of other employees who have been injured in similar circumstances over the past five years, perhaps by machinery operated by the builder or because of the type of scaffolding used, particularly if the builder denies liability, could be relevant. If that information is considered relevant, is it currently obtainable by the plaintiff under the existing rules of court? If so, that is a complete answer to this case since there would be no need for the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1214">I refer the Minister to page 12, subsection (2)(<i>e</i>) where the reference to a counter-claim calls for “full particulars of each instance of negligence by the plaintiff”. Why can there not be full particulars “where the defendant alleges that some or all of the personal injuries” were caused by the contributory negligence of the plaintiff? All that is required is “the grounds upon which he or she so alleges”. Let us have the full particulars. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the plaintiff must furnish full particulars of any claim he or she makes, why should the defendant not supply full particulars of his or her allegation that the “personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff were occasioned in whole or in part by the plaintiff’s own acts”?</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1215">This is the celebrated case of Goose <i>v.</i> Gander. It does not deal with people in like circumstances. In every court case the onus of proof is on the plaintiff. The defendant is entitled to win every case, unless the plaintiff proves as a matter of probability the correctness of the plaintiff’s propositions. The defendant is not obliged to prove anything in general terms in any proceeding. That is the first point of difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">The second is that if, for instance, one owns a pub with a set of stairs leading to basement toilets and a customer falls on these breaking his or her arm, one can legitimately say in defence that as the stairs are safe the customer's fall was due to his or her negligence. If the stairs were wet the customer should have noticed that, or whatever. In most proceedings, however, the defendant is not in a position to give particulars of how the plaintiff fell down the stairs, or landed on the ground, and cannot be asked to do so. The defendant was probably not there and can only surmise how the plaintiff was injured. If a defendant says that the accident took place as a result of the plaintiff's negligence it is often impractical to ask for all the particulars of the negligence alleged against the plaintiff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The section revolutionises proceedings from the defendant's point of view because hitherto a defendant had only to deny everything, say there was no accident, no stairs, no injury, no negligence, and that was the defence. The new section 12 provides that defendants must differentiate between the things of which he or she does or does not require proof, instead of saying "I deny everything". That was the old approach to pleadings, as I learned when I entered the Law Library, and it was carried even to the ridiculous extreme of virtually denying that the defendant was a limited liability company. Instead, this new type of pleading requires the defendant to ask what parts in the plaintiff's claim must be proved, for example, that the plaintiff fell down the stairs. If one requires proof that there are stairs in the premises the court may take a strong view of such a pleading.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">Section 12(1)(<i>b</i>) states: “the allegations specified, or matters pleaded in the personal injuries summons of which he or she requires proof” and paragraph (<i>c</i>) states: “the grounds upon which the defendant claims that he or she is not liable for any injuries suffered by the plaintiff”. Instead of denying everything the plaintiff says the defendant must deny that he or she was negligent. The defendant may accept the plaintiff fell down the stairs but may deny he or she was negligent in the matter, saying the stairs were perfectly safe, there was nothing inherently wrong with them, or if they were defective, the defect was not the cause of the fall.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">Section 12(1)(<i>d</i>) states: “where the defendant alleges that some or all of the personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff were occasioned in whole or in part by the plaintiff’s own acts, the grounds upon which he or she so alleges”. This requires the defendant to explain his or her perception of the plaintiff’s negligence so that eventually he or she will say that the stairs were perfectly safe or the plaintiff was drunk when going down the stairs to the toilet, or whatever. The defendant must set out his or her defence fairly and squarely. This is a major advance. If we go too far and insist that the defendant give particulars of matters about which he or she could have no knowledge we create difficulties because it asks the defendant to do the impossible. The plaintiff should be in a position to provide particulars of the defendant’s negligence, but the defendant is frequently absent from the scene and does not know how the accident happened and cannot give particulars.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">The same applies to counter-claims where the obligations are stringent. Subsection (3) obliges the defendant to comply, and the same sanctions for non-compliance with the previous section, to which Deputy Costello referred, apply. Failure to provide information, answer questions or set out a proper case in one's claim or counter-claim can give rise to inferences being drawn against the defendant. This significantly balances the issue. I do not want arguments about how drunk the plaintiff was when he or she fell down the stairs etc., which the defendant cannot answer. He or she does not know whether the plaintiff was mildly drunk or heavily drunk, where the plaintiff got the drink or whether the defendant or some other publican made him or her drunk. This is the type of question which a defendant cannot answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_1224">We discussed this issue at some length on Committee Stage. It arises in the context of pleadings and the requirement in the Bill to lodge the pleadings in the relevant court offices after they have been served. This will lead to unjustifiable expense for both parties, plaintiff and defendant. The system in the High Court requires lodgement of proceedings after they are set down for trial, which works perfectly well. There could also be significant administrative difficulties for the court officers in resuming an old procedure whereby pleadings were filed at the same time as they were served on the other side. For that reason, I suggest that we could do without subsections (3), (4) and (5).</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">Amendment No. 14 relates to section 14, which provides that a verifying affidavit must be lodged in court not later than 21 days after the service of the pleading by the other party. The amendment suggests that the provision be changed to ensure that the affidavit would not have to be filed in the court office within that time. Part of the thinking in this regard is that many of these claims may not necessarily go to trial in the first instance. The requirements in these sections could give rise to a danger that the system will become clogged up with paper. From a purely practical point of view, is it a wise approach and will it cause unnecessary trouble and expense? Given that we are trying to encourage people to use less paper, would it be possible to dispense with the requirements to which I refer? I accept, however, that there may be a need to return to the old system. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would consider this issue overnight.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_599" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1226">I indicated that I would consider it overnight. The Deputy is correct in one respect, namely, this is a regression to a filed pleading system. The exchange of pleading system has been the norm. This system is administratively far more convenient from the point of view of the Courts Service and reduces costs to some extent. The other side of the coin, however, is that I do not want a situation to arise where people will exchange false pleadings or make false claims and then depart the stage, abandoning a case or not proceeding with it at a late stage either out of fright or because they might be detected. I also do not want it to be the case that records of such proceedings would disappear into shredders in various solicitors' offices and would no longer be available for later investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">I am especially anxious to stop people "trying it on" or "having a go" on the assumption that they can tell a lie and then walk away from it by simply never exchanging pleadings and setting the case down for trial. I want plaintiffs who are fraudulent to know that a precondition to making a claim and proceeding with it to any extent will be that there will be a permanent record of what they said and did. These people should not be in a position to contact their solicitors and merely state, at a late stage, that they have reconsidered the case and that it should be dropped because they believe they may or may not be the subject of investigation by a private detective. I do not want it to be the case that they can get cold feet and walk away and that there would be no permanent trace of what they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">A second point of relevance in respect of serial claimants using different solicitors on different occasions against different defendants is that it would be desirable, particularly in view of the register that is provided for later in the Bill, that there would be a permanent record of the proceedings relating to a case. If insurance company A is to be given the right to consult, through its lawyers, a register which indicates whether plaintiff B has claimed against companies C, D or E in the past, it would be useful if the nature of any previous claims would be somewhere preserved on a permanent basis. The insurance company would not, therefore, be obliged to consult various solicitors in an attempt to reconstitute a claim to discover what was involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">I reflected on this matter overnight and am attracted, from the point of view of administrative convenience, to the arguments Deputy Jim O'Keeffe made. Nonetheless, I am of the opinion that there are two dangers involved. First, the concept of the register of personal injuries would be undermined if one could not at some stage discover the nature of a claim, even if one was not involved in the proceedings. Second, "have a go" type claimants would largely be able to avoid leaving a permanent trace of what they did — which would be available for third parties or the Garda at a later stage, with a view to proving fraudulent behaviour — if documents relating to proceedings could be shredded by the parties after a case was abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">For those reasons, on balance and with some degree of reluctance because I do not like to impose additional responsibilities on the Courts Service, I must adhere to the original plan of campaign. To go a different route would require making a good deal of alternative provision which I do not at this stage have the time to do.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1233">The Minister summed up the position with his final point. This legislation is non-political in nature and we are all trying to obtain the best outcome possible while trying to preserve fair balance between the different parties. In normal circumstances, we would probably come up with a better system than that which is proposed here. I accept that the Minister has given thought to my proposal and that he cannot immediately accept it. However, there is no time to seek an alternative approach. The situation with which we will be presented will be black and white. We are going to lumber the Courts Service with mountains of paper for the sake of achieving what, I accept, is a reasonable objective. One approach would be not to lumber the Courts Service with these files, but then we might not be able to achieve the stated objective. However, there are other ways of proceeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">Would it not make sense, for example, to deal with verifying affidavits in a different way. The Minister referred to documents in solicitors' offices being shredded when proceedings are finished. The latter is not done immediately and takes a considerable amount of time. I do not believe that defendants would be rushing to shred documents, particularly if they were representing an insurance company which would be seeking a full report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">What the Minister is doing is, in procedural terms, very cumbersome and, as he stated, it is a regression. I do not honestly believe it is proper to lumber the Courts Service with responsibility for filing and storing all the pleadings that will be made from the time the legislation comes into operation. The latter will be difficult, troublesome, cumbersome and expensive. Perhaps this highlights the difference between barristers and solicitors but when I was in practice in a legal office, I witnessed the cost and expense involved in employing staff and the importance of filing and storing documents. However, there are major costs involved in such filing and storing and we are now going to lumber a State service — which we are asking to become more efficient and cost-effective — with a system that dates from the last century.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">I do not intend to press the amendments. However, I am of the opinion that the Minister is taking the wrong course of action. There are better ways of achieving his objective without imposing this burden on the Courts Service or imposing unnecessary costs on the different parties involved in proceedings. At this stage, however, there is no time to devise a better system.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1242">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill introduced by my Green Party colleague, Deputy Sargent. From my early days in Macra na Feirme and farming organisations I have been involved in community activities. In the early 1960s, I was involved as secretary of the Aghabog pilot area development committee at a time when our parish had been devastated by the demise of the flax and linen industry which meant people had to go elsewhere for jobs. With a little financial help and, above all, good leadership from the late Mr. Hugh McKearney as our parish agent or agricultural adviser, the parish recovered and has prospered ever since. Many who had emigrated have since returned with their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">Sustainable development means people have the right to build their own homes and are encouraged to work in their own areas rather than being forced to migrate to the nearest big town or, as more often happens, to Dublin and other cities causing congestion among other problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, stated he was glad to have the opportunity to respond to the Bill and then he went on to rubbish it. I would not mind if he had made a genuine effort. The Green Party introduced the Bill to generate some realistic discussion. It is evident the Government has learnt nothing from last month's European and local elections when people made clear their feeling that in spite of all the strategies made and promises given, things have not been delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">All parties in the House supported better local government and structures were put in place with some community involvement. Benchmarking was agreed yet the Government failed to provide the funding for this which resulted in local councils having to use stealth taxes instead of increasing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">I agree with Deputy Sargent that there is a need to involve local government in sustainable development. However, as one who served in local government for 30 years, unless proper funding and structures are provided as well as means of raising funds, it will not be possible to achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">The Government has done everything to remove power from local government and done nothing to provide the funding it requires. At present, many local authorities do not even have sufficient funding for disabled person's grants, let alone funding for development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, listed the various strategies, guidelines, tax reliefs and plans put in place by the Government in recent years. The initial urban renewal scheme was beneficial. My county town of Monaghan, among others, benefited from that. However, the more recent tax relief schemes have not worked because of the amount of red tape and the problems associated with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">Many development groups, especially in rural Ireland, have done great work in conjunction with FÁS, yet the Government has cut back on the availability of personnel for community employment schemes. Such groups did much good work and they enjoyed working and helping their communities. Government cutbacks have resulted in some of these groups ceasing to operate while others operate in a reduced capacity. Much cross-Border funding was invested in the Patrick Kavanagh visitor centre which depends on community work schemes to maintain it. There are many people aged 55 and over who could work in such schemes if the rules were changed. People with disabilities could also work on these schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">Recently, somebody came to my office who was forced into employment with an advice group. It was clear that while he is capable of working in a community group, he is not capable of holding down a full-time job but, under the new rules, he is obliged to do so. A major improvement could be brought about if changes were made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">The national spatial strategy was announced with great fanfare. Certain towns were awarded gateway and hub status. An integrated structure was promised to ensure roads and other forms of infrastructure would be put in place. However, when the budget was announced, the national spatial strategy was simply forgotten about. Towns were selected for decentralisation with no reference to the spatial strategy that had been announced only a short time previously. It is difficult to understand how the Government can work in that manner. It is no wonder the public was disenchanted, to put it mildly. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, claimed to be delivering for his own area and signs were evident with directions to "Parlon country".</p>

          <p eId="para_1253">If the people who received those promises were excited by them, why did they not deliver in votes in the local elections? We must put in place a long-term strategy if we are to have a proper spatial strategy and sustainable development as is sought in the Bill. It should not be a case of, as the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, made clear, it being his decision to decide the night before the budget what each town should get.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">I am delighted my home town of Monaghan is classified as a hub and that there is some progress on the M2 roadway going through the area. Although little progress has been made in regard to broadband, I hope that will come in time. Other towns that did not have hub status were chosen for significant decentralisation. I am not complaining that my area has not benefited from decentralisation, rather I am complaining from the point of view of planning about the decentralisation decisions taken. How can they be justified?</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, referred to the importance of tidy town and tidy village groups. They have been brilliant, have improved the appearance and brought about a new community involvement not only in towns and villages but also, importantly, in housing estates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Rural housing was announced by the Taoiseach as an issue of major importance. It was then mentioned by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. The bottom line is that nothing has yet happened. Those who thought they would be guaranteed a rural house no longer have that option. There is no point in talking about these issues. If we do not have sustainable building for single houses in parishes like mine in Aghabog, no sustainable rural development will take place anywhere in the country to provide the football teams, the people for the churches and schools that are already in place, and save us having to build others.</p>

In Dublin we can see Luas and other developments around the city. What is happening in rural Ireland? People are leaving in droves. Rural housing is an impossibility. As mentioned earlier, the Taoiseach highlighted rural housing as one of the biggest issues affecting those in rural communities and he was 100% right. However, since then nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">The Government's White Paper on Rural Development promised a huge amount but nothing came of it. The White Paper is a shambles when it comes to tackling the problems of rural Ireland. In all counties rural schools are closing down due to dwindling numbers in our rural communities and still the Government sits idly by. This is why I commend the Green Party on introducing this Bill to bring to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas the importance of rural communities and the importance of considering where rural communities should be located. As Deputy Batt O'Keeffe knows, the Government has reneged on rural communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1263">As stated in the explanatory memorandum, the Bill takes a bottom up rather than a top down approach. I was involved in a project in a village in north Kerry, Ballylongford, which showed how this could be put into action. Kerry County Council established an integrated services committee that comprised officials from the county council, local elected representatives and the local community. We considered the four aspects mentioned in the Bill. In the area of local environmental protection, already the derelict sites have been cleaned out in the village. On recycling, we introduced bottle banks and bring banks and we are considering a different treatment system using the local environment. On local services and jobs, there is now a chance of an enterprise unit being built in the town. The local authority came together with local people and elected representatives. I believe the Ballylongford project should form a blueprint for other communities across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">I say to Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who is a great defender of Government policy, that communities throughout the country are falling apart. He should knock on the doors in villages in Kerry like Brosna and Knocknagoshel, which are only one third full. While those on the Government benches are all good friends of mine, the Government has no policy on rural Ireland. A White Paper was initiated before we left office in 1997.</p>

          <p eId="para_1294">I listened to part of the contribution by Deputy Gogarty last night, in which he stated that many of the planning decisions in the past have now been shown to be unsustainable. He is right. He referred loosely to his constituency and the part where he resides in the Lucan area and that part of west Dublin which is growing rapidly. Major housing developments have been built but now the council is struggling to provide all the other services to make it work. I agree with him on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">Where I fundamentally disagreed with Deputy Gogarty was when we had an opportunity to create a balanced development in Adamstown. Before Deputy Gogarty or I were elected, the lands in Adamstown were zoned residential, so the option facing Deputy Gogarty and me as local councillors at that time, was whether we would do more of what we did wrong in the past or whether we chose a better way forward. The better way was to consider individual planning applications in a strategic manner and in the context of the entirety of the scheme, to carry them out in a phased way and to provide the infrastructure such as roads, schools and public transport.</p>

I was disappointed that the members of the Green Party, who subscribe to sustainable development, would not support this initiative when it was a better way of going forward. The Adamstown development was a new way forward supported by every major party except the Green Party. It may not be perfect, there may be individual issues but the options were to go with a strategic development zone or with more of the same. I regret to say that the Green Party would not support a new way forward and that flies in the face of the Bill before us.</p>

The Green Party sits with Sinn Féin, a party with a one size fits all approach to issues. Whatever it is, it is against it. It is natural that the Green Party sits comfortably with this.

It is worthwhile having the debate and fair play to the Green Party for introducing Private Members' Bills. However, in practice, the business must be done. There was an example in the centre of Dún Laoghaire of a rezoning application in connection with an 18-hole golf course. In terms of sustainability, it could not have been a better example of where to rezone for housing. There could not have been a more obvious example of sustainability.

          <p eId="para_1335">Like Deputy Curran, I was somewhat confused as to what this Bill was about. Sometimes we legislate when we do not really need to and when there is enough legislation already. The basic criteria for the adjudication of planning permission is proper planning and sustainable development. That is the single guiding principle to determine a planning application. The term "sustainable development" has been in and out of the courts for the past four years, since the new Planning and Development Act. The guidelines also lay down that it must be proper planning and sustainable development of an area. We already have a strong statutory basis for sustainable development and the courts have constantly told us what the criteria should be, including the phrase, "the common good".</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">To get back to Dún Laoghaire, there was an opportunity to develop what was an 18-hole golf course and the Green Party claimed a green lung for the borough as though it were the Amazon forest. The plan was to turn it into two public parks, 1,000 housing units, crèches, shops, light industrial development to provide sustainability, and all within the vicinity of quality bus corridors, the DART and schools. The Green Party rejected that opportunity. There is sufficient legislation to ensure sustainable development. All that stands in the way of it is weak decisions by local councillors and a lack of courage, at times, to take the tough decisions. The presence of Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Partnership, along with the county and city development boards provides enough forums already for these issues to be debated. This Private Members' Bill will only add another layer of bureaucracy that is unnecessary at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1337">I am only going to take about four and a half minutes, so I would appreciate if the Green Party would let me give my speech and heckle me on another day. I am especially pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this matter and I compliment Deputy Sargent and his colleagues. I do so because I was listening to the debate last night and most of the Opposition Members who claimed they would vote for the Bill actually opposed it in their speeches. I am trying to be helpful and am aware of Green Party sensitivities in that regard. Like Deputy Curran, I am sorry Deputy Gogarty is not here. I hope the party has given him time off for his honeymoon because he certainly deserves it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">Reference has been made by colleagues to their constituencies. We often talk about Tallaght and sustainable development. When I moved there first, with an employer, in 1969, it was still a village. For many years we talked about Tallaght, as it developed, having the population of a city but still retaining the status of a village. Happily, many years later it is a city in its own right. It has its own town centre, civic headquarters, hospital and all the facilities one might expect in what is the country's third largest population centre. At the end of August the Luas will come to town at last and we will be delighted to use it. I use that as an example, to show where I am coming from as far as these issues are concerned. It is important to support the concept of sustainable development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">Like other colleagues, I remind the House that sustainable development is best described as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable development concepts and objectives are not always straightforward either to grasp or communicate and we can easily lose the public support that is essential for achieving practical results, whether in areas of environment, waste, housing or the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">In the past decade sustainable development has moved from pioneering aspiration to the centre of political debate. That is good and it is true both throughout Europe and here at home. No one questions our continuing need for growth and social progress. More importantly, no one takes the view that these needs override our responsibility to protect the natural environment and the natural resource space of the future. Every morning I leave the house I am able to look up towards the mountains. I can be at the Blessington lakes within a few minutes. I am clear about the need to protect the environment for the good of people living in built-up communities. In that regard, striking the right balance between environmental, economic and social areas of development will be a core concern for us all for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">On an issue such as this, there is much to be said. However, I am conscious of the time and I am particularly anxious that the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, should have the opportunity to say a few words. I look forward to voting on the Bill and wish the Green Party well.</p>

Given the high levels of economic growth over the past decade, it is clear that Ireland has improved the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of its economy more than any other EU member state. National emission levels have largely been stabilised for the rest of the decade on the basis of measures that have already been put in place. They will be reduced further as the implementation of the national climate change strategy is intensified.</p>

          <p eId="para_1360">An important element of the strategy is participation in emissions trading. I am pleased that the Commission today unconditionally approved the Irish national allocation plan. Irish industry has a target level of reduction in emissions between 2005 and 2007 — the run-up to the Kyoto deadline — and a means to achieve the target in the most cost-effective manner. Environmental targets and the protection of competitiveness are balanced by the use of this instrument. Emissions trading for industry and Government purchases of Kyoto credits for the non-emissions trading sector are part of a coherent programme to ensure that Ireland meets its Kyoto target. The other key element is the implementation of domestic reduction strategies, as set out in the Government's national climate change strategy. We will vigorously pursue the implementation of further key elements of the national strategy. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, is bringing forward a review of the strategy to ensure that all cost-effective measures to reduce emissions are implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_1376">I welcome the Sustainable Communities Bill 2004, generally speaking, and I thank the Green Party for introducing it. One of the problems with the legislation, which is worthy if a little threadbare, is its failure to define precisely what the Green Party means when it refers to sustainable communities. Building sustainable communities involves a significant number of factors and embraces many different issues. We all aspire to be more eco-friendly, we all want the quality of our natural environment to be maintained or improved and we all want more people to play a more active role in local communities. If that is to happen, as some speakers said during the debate, we must give local representatives and the councils and authorities on which they sit more power to make the necessary changes to transform our environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">During the local government election campaign which concluded some weeks ago, the Labour Party sought to initiate a debate on the purpose and role of local government. We produced an extensive policy document advocating the most radical reform of local government in this country for more than a century. As soon as we took up office in towns, cities and counties throughout Ireland, we began to attempt to put our policies into action. For example, we took part in negotiations and reached agreement on the democratic charter for change in Dublin, which we made a priority before we reached consensus with Fine Gael, the Green Party and a number of other city councillors. The charter speaks of sustainable communities in a different manner to how they have been described by speakers in this debate so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">The Labour Party was the first party to identify the housing crisis, produce an analysis and policy to solve it, propose affordable housing, propose rights for tenants, argue that there should be a constitutional right to housing and propose controls on the price of building land. Labour Party councillors can be trusted to make decisions in favour of social and affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">In the charter for change in Dublin we specifically highlighted access to housing as the key to building sustainable communities. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1380">Many young Dubliners cannot afford to buy a home in their own neighbourhood and many have to leave the city to find an affordable home. We will work to improve the quality and affordability of Dublin housing. We will strive to provide more social and affordable homes for those left out of the housing market. We will work to eliminate homelessness and we will establish local structures to prevent homelessness at its source. We will seek to protect those in rented accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">The policies being adopted in Dublin will be pursued in Cork, Galway, Waterford or any other part of the country. If we are to talk about creating sustainable communities, Members of the House must agree that access to adequate and affordable housing is a key issue. The Government has steadfastly refused to act on the price of building land. Private developers continue to hoard land banks which contributes to an escalation in house prices that is almost unmatched anywhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">Housing is one of the many issues that need to be addressed. Despite the growth and prosperity that is visible throughout Ireland, a lack of adequate planning has given rise to sprawling development, creating increasingly isolated communities and neighbourhoods and immense and unmanageable traffic jams. This version of Ireland is unrecognisable from the type of society the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wants to produce, according to its strategy on sustainable development, Making Ireland's Development Sustainable. The priorities emphasised in the strategy document are worthy and cannot be faulted. From seeking to break the link between economic growth and damage to the environment to working for the closure of the Sellafield nuclear plant, a list of honourable and worthwhile targets are set out to marry economic progress with environmental protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">However, when we review the record of this Government over recent years it is clear that this document is not grounded in reality. Investment in public transport, for example, has been so badly managed that it has created chaos in our towns and cities, especially in Dublin. New transport systems are delivered way over budget and existing ones are badly integrated. Accident and emergency departments are under strain, classrooms are overcrowded and neighbourhoods are inadequately policed. Many housing estates are tortured by anti-social activity. So-called joyriding continues to present a major threat to law-abiding citizens. Elderly people live in fear. Drug abuse is rife. To deal adequately with vandalism, additional resources are required in this area of crime where convictions are most difficult to obtain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">Local stakeholders must be given more of a say in the way their communities function. That is the key to creating more sustainable communities. To achieve that, local councils and authorities must also be overhauled to allow public representatives lead their communities imaginatively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">As such, the aim of the Bill presented by the Green Party is welcome. Giving local authorities the power to draft and implement local sustainable strategies should see the delivery of better services. Protecting the environment, generating a dynamic economy, ensuring nobody suffers poverty and involving as many people as possible in this process are aims to which we should aspire. Introducing legislation to ensure the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government actively promotes better, sustainable communities should be supported. The key to all this, however, must be the empowerment of local government and not just the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">We fully recognise that local government, regardless of how well it is equipped, cannot accomplish everything on its own, but Labour wants councillors to be able to give a lead to determine the real priorities and to be in a strong position to advance the cause of their local communities. The Labour Party wants a new and modern allocation of responsibilities to local authorities, redesigned to meet modern needs. That means setting up regional authorities to deal with issues like health and transport with other more local functions being assigned to local councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">Ireland has the weakest system of local government in the European Union. At best, we have a system of local administration through which unelected managers make the executive decisions for our cities, towns and counties. We all want to influence what happens to our localities and neighbourhoods. Our vision of a sustainable community, therefore, addresses the following issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">Labour is the only party to publish a fully costed alternative to the Government's failed anti-environment waste policies. That gives the Labour Party the authority to explain how recycling and composting can become a reality, waste can be treated as a new resource, waste management should remain a public service, private waste operators should be regulated and the reason households with low income or little waste should not pay bin charges. The Labour Party stands for public services. That is the reason we will promote public libraries, develop parks, provide public playgrounds and public recreation facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">When a choice must be made in council chambers between public amenity and private development, Labour will always choose the public good. We are also the only party to have published a national document on planning, Visions of Ireland, which integrates spatial strategy with transport, infrastructure and the protection of the environment. We have contributed to town and county development plans based on the principles of good planning and the needs of local communities. These are but a few of the issues we see as informing sustainable communities. Traffic management, poverty and health care are other examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">The public wants an influence over its local environment, the way neighbourhoods are planned and developed, the amenities that make local communities work, the schools which can teach children, the hospital and local health services, transport and traffic matters, policing and care of the young and the elderly. These are the everyday issues that shape the quality of our lives. Any legislation that allows local communities to have more of a say in shaping their local areas merits the support of all the parties in the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_714">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1391">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and thank the Green Party for tabling it. The concept of sustainability is a relatively new one and is largely seen as relating to protection of the natural environment. I prefer the holistic definition that encompasses social as well as environmental sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">Many speakers in the debate spoke about the need to support disadvantaged communities, and I agree with them. Too many people are suffering from the effects of Government policies that are designed to serve commercial interests rather than the interests of communities. Inequality has now become the hallmark of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">Against that background, setting out a framework to create a community-based response to the environmental challenge, as this Bill does, makes sense, as does making local authorities central to that process. One of the most disturbing features of a dominance for so long of the agenda of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is the general run-down of local democracy and local services. The position in regard to waste management is a case in point. Powers are being removed from local representatives rather than returned to them and local authorities are becoming less relevant, particularly with the creeping privatisation of services and the loss of local control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">Nowhere is this more evident than in the area of health care. One only has to look at the record. To develop a good quality, accessible health service it is vital that accountability is guaranteed by law. We have a Government that talks about health reform but all that has changed so far is that local accountability has effectively been dismantled. With the abolition of the health boards we have seen the biggest grab for executive power in the history of local administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">It is interesting to note that where such an experiment at centralisation was tried elsewhere, as in New Zealand, it failed. That country is now making amends by setting up more health boards than ever before to bring its health service into line with the needs of local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396">Here we have a Government that talks about decentralisation while planning to centralise health services to an extraordinary and unhealthy degree. The good health of individuals and communities is at the core of sustainability, yet in Ireland we do not have a healthy society. We come top or near the top of too many leagues. Cardiovascular disease and lung diseases are two cases in point. We have the highest death rate from lung diseases in Europe, higher even than the old Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. The cost of treating these diseases is phenomenal. Estimates indicate that respiratory diseases cost Europe nearly €102 billion per year. That is apart from the human cost which is inestimable. Smoking, environmental factors, climate and poverty are all blamed for this high death rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">Sustainability is the key to much more than simply recycling our waste. It is about creating the kind of environment whereby our population no longer suffers, for example, a level of lung disease that is more than twice the EU average and that ensures health promotion is an essential part of health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398">Raising environmental standards is an important measure but there is a clear class dimension to disease and ill-health that we ignore at our peril. People living in poverty tend to be sicker and die younger than the affluent. When it comes to tackling this health challenge, what is most telling is that factual research shows us that in countries where the gap between rich and poor is small, the overall health of the community is best. That presents us with a challenge that transcends health reform <i>per se</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399">This is about social and economic change and narrowing the gap that has opened up in society between the wealthy and the poor. Ireland is now one of the most unequal societies in the world and the health of our people is suffering as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">In tackling this unhealthy state we need to listen to communities and their needs and empower those without power. However, Government policy is directed to exacerbating the problem. This Bill, small as it is, will ameliorate the effects of social and environmental factors that harm rather than heal.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_715">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1401">I support this Bill that seeks to promote local sustainable development. Such development has not yet happened in this State. Housing schemes are designed without safe pathways or cycle-ways to schools or even shops and little or no green areas or playgrounds are provided. Development has occurred with no thought for the welfare of communities, much less for sustainable communities. Local authorities are allowed to get away with carelessness when each official should be clued in to what is really needed. There is the mess of waste management. Token bottle banks scattered around communities to create an illusion of action by a Government that pays nothing more than lip service to waste management. On average, only 50% of the waste management plans created five years ago have been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">This will not change until real consultative structures are put in place. The main plank of consultation at local authority level is the strategic policy committee. A majority of Members will have served on these while on local authorities. My experience of the committees is of a chair and officials struggling to simply get through the meeting. Rarely have I seen a strategic policy committee examine an issue critically, let alone set objectives and devise a strategy to achieve them. Yet this is what these key bodies were established to achieve five years ago. They have failed because in the minds of some local authority officials, it is seen as interference by civil society in their domain. These officials are not solely to blame for this elitist attitude as the Government, if it has not encouraged them, has allowed them to develop it. The introduction of the strategic policy committees was a typical move by this Government in bringing forward commendable legislation but simply not implementing it. Again, it has created an illusion of movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">Though I support the provision for consultation in local areas, it should be broadened. Local fora can be established at a tier below that of local councillors. Though success would depend on the efforts of specific individuals, it would go some way in reinvigorating local communities. An integrated and participatory approach must be built since many communities were turned off the political system by the legacy of local authority corruption in the 1970s and 1980s. The cross-Border element of the Bill is most welcome and essential for local sustainable development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404">The bottom line rests with real reform of local government as the current structure cannot deliver the local sustainable strategy referred to in the Bill. Local government needs to be empowered and accountable. If a county manager is wayward, a local authority representative cannot raise the issue. Even Members cannot raise such a matter in the House as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not accountable for a county manager's actions. Adequately financed local government is another key element to ensuring sustainable development. Only then will people expect adequate services from their local authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1407">The search for a sustainable and humane model of development has gathered momentum. This search means attaining economic prosperity, social justice and ecological health with the highest possible quality of life in the best possible environment. This Bill is to be welcomed as it aims to enable local people and communities to achieve such a sustainable community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">Local Agenda 21, the global action plan agreed at the 1992 UN conference on the environment and development stressed the enabling role of local authorities in transforming unsustainable patterns of development and empowering local communities. Toward the close of the last millennium, Ireland has woken up to the challenges inherent in this agenda. Only now have we detected an undercurrent of change driven by EU legislation and the demand for goods and services produced with equity and environmental impact in mind. The response of numerous local authorities to Local Agenda 21 varied. In some cases, they merely engaged in a repackaging of existing environmental responsibilities. To address the most important elements of sustainability, local communities must strive for efficient use of resources, waste minimisation, limitation of pollution to manageable levels, valuing the diversity of nature and local needs to be met locally. Local communities must also strive to ensure that people live without fear of violence and crime or persecution of race, beliefs, gender or sexuality. All sections of the community must be empowered to participate in decision-making processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409">How far has Ireland progressed in achieving these laudable aims? The report card will indicate "a little done, a lot more to do or could do better". The development of a sustainable community would entail the establishment of a core group of enthusiastic volunteers and organisations as a steering committee to help the community and environment. This core group would be open to the public, meeting regularly and forming task forces to develop and implement specific projects. This Bill is the first real attempt to empower local government and its citizens to develop sustainable community strategies.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_719">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_1410">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Sustainability covers social and quality of life issues as well as environmental protection. Those very issues have not been properly addressed by the Government. For sustainability to succeed it is important that local services are provided. The Government's proposals for the administrative and hospital levels of the health service are an attempt to take resources, such as accident and emergency, maternity and paediatric services, from local communities. This is also detrimental to their sustainability. Local authority and working class housing estates have been built without proper open areas, playing fields, community centres or Garda protection for local people. Serious incidents of anti-social activity now occur throughout the country. The Government has abandoned many estates and left them without the services of community gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_1411">Regarding rural communities, the trend in recent years has been one of closure of local post offices, Garda stations, banks and co-op branches, along with the decimation by the Government of the local community employment schemes which look after playing fields, parishes, the tidy towns projects and a host of local matters. These issues are important in the sustainability debate. I welcome this Bill as an opening to the discussions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_720">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_1412">Sustainability is something we often discuss but rarely if ever define or put into practice. It first came to prominence in Rio de Janeiro and subsequently in Johannesburg where I attended the summit on sustainable development. We all need to define sustainability and put it in perspective. The Bruntland report defined sustainable development as development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising those of future generations. It is about defining quality of life rather than standard of living. This Government may be quite good in terms of maintaining standards of living as we define them but its record on quality of life is not good. We have seen that. Quality of life has deteriorated during this Government's reign.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413">In the area of holistic and joined-up thinking, the Government is remiss. The Green Party has a "join the dots" campaign to promote joined-up thinking. When it comes to public transport for example it is clear the Government has not got its act together. When we talk of sustainable communities, we are talking of joined-up thinking, of local communities having schools and facilities, and of walking and cycling to school. That is becoming rarer. I recently pointed out in a letter to <i>The Irish Times </i>that there are now more girls being driven to secondary school than cycling there. That is depressing and the situation needs to be tackled quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">Local communities do not have any input. This is what agenda 21 was all about. It wanted local communities and representatives to have an input into sustainable communities. This is happening to an increasingly lesser degree. Within my constituency, Terenure has recently drawn up a sustainable plan for the area which includes underground recycling. This is done in Holland and works well there. It means that one can locate recycling banks in the centre of an area without people objecting on the grounds of unsightliness and noise. One can then get a lorry to remove the materials. Dublin City Council's response however is that hiring the lorry is too expensive. That is short-term thinking because, if we do not take such an approach we will not get the level of recycling which we all want. Local community representatives went to Sintra in Portugal to find out how it could be done, so they have expertise developed at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415">Instead of local government, what we have is local administration. During the period this Government has ruled, an increasing number of powers have been taken from local representatives. There was a time when there were reserved functions in the environment area. They included the making of management plans for air and water quality and waste along with the making of a development plan. All this has been diluted over a period. One can look in particular at the powers taken away with regard to waste. Despite that an increasing number of councillors are opposed to waste incineration and have put forward plans for zero waste, they are not being listened to. Incinerators are being imposed on local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416">Councillors have an input into the development plan and can make zoning decisions, but in many cases their input is ignored by city managers. I will give a pertinent example in my constituency. As far back as the early 1980s, Dublin Corporation clearly wanted to develop Scully's Field, a green space in the middle of my constituency. In 1998, Dublin City Council in its draft development plan recommended that the land at Scully's Field be rezoned to Z1 status. That would have allowed for residential development. The councillors in the area and all the residents were opposed to this. They objected, and the lands were zoned back to Z9 status. That status is the one which applies to St. Stephen's Green and Merrion Square, green open spaces which are what we require in the city if it is to be fit not only for children to play in but also for adults. It is about quality of life, not about making a quick buck on a five-storey development. Unfortunately this has been ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417">I have asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to consider this serious problem because it is now quite clear that the Dublin City Council manager has made yet another proposal to build accommodation on the site in question. That is unacceptable. On 11 March 2002 a presentation was made by the campaign committee which received unanimous support from the councillors. It is quite clear that all this has been ignored. If one has a situation in which councillors, local representatives and all the residents of an area are asking that it would be zoned in a certain way and that request is ignored, it means we do not have sustainable development. That is something the Government needs to examine.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_721">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1418">If the Fianna Fáil Deputies from the boroughs of Dún Laoghaire and Dublin Mid-West were present I would tend to respond to them. Their discussion of planning issues in those areas is remarkable, but throwing dirt at another party with regard to planning and zoning in those two areas was an interesting tactic to which we might return another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">I have been trying to think of examples of targets or measurements we could use when looking to assess sustainability on a local level. I prefer the most local means, if possible at parish or street level. That is when targets really hit home. I recall as a child in Dublin seeing in a monthly parish newsletter the amounts being given by the different city parishes to the general diocesan collection. It has a strange effect. One was always measuring one's own parish to see how it was doing in comparison with others. We have seen other targets and measures recently, not all positive or beneficial. We now have an example in our education system whereby we are shown the lists of schools feeding students to the various universities, as if that is an accurate measure. It nevertheless has a major effect. The newspapers would not be giving it such coverage if people were not paying such attention to it, although I fundamentally disagree with that particular measure as a narrow reduction of what education should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">Regarding local authorities and local council areas, there are a few areas where we can specifically target development and measure how we are doing. Waste management and measurement is a topical issue. We know we will move to this system which will target waste almost down to household level. We will measure the weight and how much is recycled, and use this to work out how much we must pay for waste. While on Dublin City Council I came across a slightly different approach which may provide a solution. Bin lorries, which fill up with the waste of two or three streets, would be weighed before and after filling up. This would make it easy to measure how much waste is coming from each two or three streets. It would also be easy to measure the waste management and recycling in those streets just by carrying out a random sample test.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">In this regard, the quality of what goes into the green bins is more important than the quantity, and there is nothing worse than trying to take glass out of paper packing. If we set street by street performance measurement as a target, I am sure, due to our collective spirit to work together to achieve targets, every green bin would be out on the streets and roads at the right time, full of recycled materials. There would be community spirit and a sustainability target behind it. Such a street level example could then be used on a broader basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">Deputy Gormley referred to school transport. There is a concept known as "safe routes to schools" through which very easy targets can be set, such as to find how many children are walking or cycling to school or where safety problems such as a lack of bus services may occur. It is very easy on a yearly basis to measure these and to aggregate the figures into a collective figure for an area or county.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423">Targets are possible and they help. They make us concentrate on what exactly is sustainability. It can be difficult to understand because it is a word that has been so abused it is hard to fully appreciate. However, it is not getting easier to appreciate as examples of its abuse become more flagrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">One example comes from the new regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. Goal five of the guidelines was that we would have sustainable infrastructure corridors, which I initially welcomed. However, the definition of this in the report is: "The organisation of settlements and new economic developments within a system of transport corridors may provide a basic pattern which infrastructure will find a sound basis for long-term planning of economically viable primary infrastructure systems." It is a difficult sentence but having read it perhaps a dozen times, I translate it to mean that if we can plan so that development pays for toll roads, it will be sustainable. It is an economic view only, which is too narrow a definition. We need to move beyond that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_722">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1425">Among the abuses of the definition of sustainability is that the word is commonly used in public discourse to mean it is somehow about sustaining our current level of progress. It is the basis on which the current partnership agreement exists. That definition of the word "sustaining" is not in any way related to the term "sustainability", which, as my colleagues have described, is about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">It is interesting that today has seen the release of the enterprise strategy statement. The Bill seeks to discuss sustainability in its widest sense, economic as well as environmental and in terms of social inclusion and local democracy. The centrepiece of the enterprise strategy statement is for a sustainable economy into the future. We must build upon, foster and generate an indigenous local economy and support locally owned industries. This is something the Green Party has said for many years and has taken abuse from the other side of the House for doing so. Foreign direct investment was and is welcome. However, in the long term, it is not sustainable in a globalised economy when that investment can go to another country in the blink of an eye.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">Today's statement is at least an indication of how sustainability should be built into future economic policy. I hope the Government takes this lesson on board because we have many other ideas we would like to share with it. What the Green Party says will eventually be adopted not only by the Government but by other political parties — that has been our history. The philosophy we believe in has already brought about significant changes in public policy and we are proud of that role. We look to presently having the opportunity in government to implement what we believe to be sustainable Government policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">International definitions of sustainability were agreed at the Rio de Janeiro conference on economic and environmental development in 1992, at which the Government as a signatory promised to set up Local Agenda 21 groups but did precisely nothing. The conference was followed by a similar conference in Johannesburg where such groups were meant to become local groups, yet the Government did precisely nothing. This is because the political culture in this country is top down rather than bottom up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429">The nature of the Bill is to introduce a bottom up culture. It seeks to put in place means by which consultation becomes real — not the definition of consultation which has come from the Government and many State agencies, where people are told what will happen before it happens, yet it happens anyway, regardless of what they think or how they can contribute to the process. A sustainable society uses as its resource the people themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">The nature of the contribution made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, was sad in its emptiness. He talked about infrastructure and tax concessions but made no reference whatsoever to people or local communities. I noted particularly the reference he made to tax incentives which applied to urban development. Deputy Gallagher made his contribution following that of Deputy Cowley, who talked about the need for sustainability in rural communities. Deputy Cowley was right to say that many urban settlements are unsustainable. The existence of urban sprawl creates an environment where people live in impersonal settings that are recipes for social strife. On the other hand, the Government has no policy in regard to the sustainability of rural communities, to make sure that populations are maintained in towns and villages that protect the existing infrastructure and that there are no closures of schools, post offices and Garda stations. In a sense, settlements, whether urban or rural, are critical mass. Despite this, the Government twists and turns and chooses to make its own definition in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">The contributions of many Fianna Fáil Members were nothing other than abuse. They did not address the nature of the Bill in any way. I am disappointed that even though two of the members of the Progressive Democrats are present, the Ministers, Deputies McDowell and Tim O'Malley, that party has chosen not to say anything in this debate on sustainability. However, we know that the Progressive Democrats' philosophy is that the needs of society and communities can be met by the market. They argue the alternative is to have those needs met by the State. This is wrong. Neither the State nor the market can define the needs or provide the resources for those needs to be met. Ultimately, it is local communities which will define their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">However, a political system and approach that can be adopted exists through legislation such as this. It has been moved in other Parliaments and has been put into practice in other jurisdictions, and we would like to put it in place here. We regard the Bill as a cornerstone of any legislative programme the Green Party would be involved in. The likelihood is that, following the sneers and derision, a time will come when the Progressive Democrats and Governments think the same way because the options will have run out. The emptiness of the Progressive Democrats' approach in regard to the sustainability of future generations will be found wanting, as it already is in terms of the type of society being created, particularly in terms of social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433">Ultimately, after economics, environmental protection and social inclusion, we are talking about the fourth cornerstone of local democracy. It is opportune to introduce this Bill now given that local elections have been held recently. It is worth noting that those elections saw the first increase in turnout in local elections in over 50 years. We believe this is an opportunity to engage with people rather than to continue the top down system of governing that has alienated so many in our society. This Bill, flawed as it is, is a mechanism or vehicle which, if it passed Committee and Remaining Stages, would assist many communities in improving the lives of people where they live.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1546">This amendment seems desirable because it would reduce administration and costs. I would have thought an amendment of that nature would be very attractive to the Minister. Why should the Courts Service have a new tier of administrative filing of documents if that can be avoided? Currently all the pleadings will now be lodged in the central office at the High Court, the Circuit Court office for the county in which the action is brought and the District Court office for the district in which the action is brought. There will be a significant scattering of pleadings filed all over the place. Could we not wait until the proceedings are set down for trial as is currently done and retain the current system which I understand works perfectly well? If that is the wish of the practitioners and the Courts Service, who will be directly affected, some consideration should be given to their views.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_724">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1547">I have been considering how we could deal with the situation. It is accepted that my proposed amendment is sensible, that it is cost effective, that it will avoid a cumbersome accumulation of paper in court offices, that it is supported by the legal profession and is to the advantage of plaintiffs and defendants, and that it is of particular advantage to the Courts Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1548">What the Minister has in mind is that evidence should be available in case of an allegation of perjury against a plaintiff. This could also apply to a defendant. Is it possible that if we retain the provision whereby an affidavit must be filed in the court office, the Minister would ensure that the original document on which a charge under the section would be based would be available, but that court offices would not be encumbered with all the paperwork involved in the pleadings?</p>
          <p eId="para_1549">Is the Minister prepared to operate on that basis and effectively agree to my amendment to delete sections 13(3), (4) and (5)? That would remove the requirement to file the pleadings on delivery. The situation regarding pleadings could then be covered by the rules of court and the pleadings would be filed if the action were set down. At the same time we could continue to provide in section 14 for an affidavit to be lodged in court. The original evidence, the sworn affidavit, would be available if required for subsequent proceedings. It is the only shortcut I can find in the time available to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550">If the Minister and his officials believe it could resolve the problem, it would save the Courts Service enormous sums of money. It would also save the Courts Service a fair amount of staffing and enable the Minister to achieve the objectives of having the original primary document, the sworn affidavit, available if required for proceedings. It is the best I can do to provide an answer at this stage in light of the fact that we have not enough time to devise any other solution. If that were agreeable to the Minister, I would be prepared to ask him to accept my amendment to section 13 and withdraw my amendment to section 14.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_725">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1551">I support what Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Costello have said so far on this. If this is to remain, as they have stated, it will be an additional cost on the Courts Service. Usually, when we table amendments, we are not allowed to impose a cost on the Exchequer. I do not know whether the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, knows whether the Minister is imposing an additional cost on the Courts Service in the extra work that it will have to do in dealing with the extra caseload at the various courts. Perhaps the Courts Service will come looking for an extra grant from the Minister to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552">The proposal is essentially that we delete everything from line 36 to line 44. That would allow for the rules of the court to decide how such pleadings are lodged and enable the rules to be changed if the system were not working, were overburdened or required tweaking. It is much easier to change or tweak the rules of the court regarding certain circumstances than, if the place is inundated and the system is breaking down, to have to return here with additional legislation because we have tied the hands of the Courts Service by saying that things must be done in a certain way. The Courts Service would prefer the system to be left as it currently stands and that it could regulate or change it through the rules of court in future.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1553">There is no doubt that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is persistent. He has persuaded me that I should get rid of section 13(3) to (5), inclusive. I intend that the rules of court will specify that the affidavit to be lodged under section 14 have annexed to it or exhibited in it the pleading being verified.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>

If the Minister looks at the reference to the affidavit in section 14(4) the requirement is that it "shall be lodged in court". That expression is commonly used for the purpose of filing documents in the court office. When we talk about making a lodgement on behalf of the defence we make a lodgement in court. There is a slight problem about changing the terminology in this case because there is an old rule to the effect that when there is express mention of certain things, anything not mentioned is excluded. It could cause problems because if we change it here and refer to lodging in an office in the court we are not so providing in all the other parts of the Bill. Anything else is merely being lodged in court as in the example of section 14(4). From a technical point of view this change could cause problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_1597">As I explained on Committee Stage last night, the Minister is in a peculiar position in respect of most rules of court which are decided autonomously by a rules committee, and the Minister's function is to say "Yes" or "No". He or she does not have the power of initiative. I cannot direct a rules committee to propose a rule I think sensible. Giving me this power, however, does not prevent the rules committee from making a similar proposal were I never to commence the section or exercise the power, as long as that proposal was consistent with the Act. It is intended to give me the right to ensure it does happen rather than that it is put on the long finger.</p>

There is a rules making committee but this specifically excludes it, or states categorically that the Minister makes the order. It says nothing about the present system whereby the rules of court prescribe and the Minister approves. If that was intended it should say so. This is not a Humpty Dumpty situation in which words mean what one wants them to mean. It is either prescribed by order of the Minister or not.

          <p eId="para_1604">Much will depend on the court but the date will be fixed by reference to the trial of an action, depending on the advice I receive, and I will confer with the Courts Service on this issue. The decision may be that someone must make a final offer within ten, 14 or 21 days before the trial of an action, or within some period proximate to it. This will depend on a number of factors, including the degree of case management the courts undertake. Case management in the District Court and case management in the High Court are different propositions. However, I envisage that the pre-trial conferences provided for under the legislation will take place and that the parties will not be in a position to follow what has been the classical habit in Irish personal injuries litigation, namely, trial by ambush with nobody knowing what witnesses will be called by the other side or what issues will be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1605">I expect the Judiciary to take these pre-trial conferences seriously to the extent that it is reasonable to do so. If a case in the District Court involved an argument over €300, a pre-trial conference might be a complete waste of time. However, if it is a substantial case involving, for example, medical negligence, I expect that the Judiciary would, under the legislation, hold a conference well in advance of such a case being tried. It would be made clear to both sides at such a conference the witnesses to be called and the sequence of events to be followed. In addition, there would be a discussion as to whether all pre-trial procedures have been complied with, whether both sides are in a position to proceed, the evidence that is agreed and the evidence on affidavit that will be accepted under the provisions of the legislation. If a case is managed to that extent, it would be reasonable to say to the parties that they must make their final offers to each other 14 days prior to the date fixed for trial.</p>

          <p eId="para_1613">I hope my colleagues in the Law Library and the solicitors' profession will not be too upset to hear me say that the new regime, which will involve case management, working out in advance the shape of a trial, bringing in evidence on affidavit, permitting people to testify effectively by affidavit and resolving conflicts of testimony between expert witnesses by means of the courts appointing their own experts who might swear affidavits and bring matters to a conclusion, will bring about an entirely new culture in the disposal of civil litigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1614">I accept the implication made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe that if the current system continues to obtain, final offers might not be final offers because people would continue to be unsure as to when their cases would be taken. I am optimistic enough to believe that, when the Bill becomes law, the Judiciary will be in a position to structure the entire trial process in a way which will give rise to the setting of definite dates on which trials will commence.</p>

          <p eId="para_1628">When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage, the Minister stated that he would contemplate whether details of the register should be placed on the Internet and come back to us on it. While we understand the need for a register, making it available on the Internet would seem to imply that those who have taken or are bringing personal injuries actions are somehow acting improperly or fraudulently. I accept that fraudulent claims have been made and it is my view that the names of those who are found guilty of making such claims should be placed on a register that is available to all. However, the majority of personal injury claims are brought for legitimate reasons. On some occasions these claims fail, while on others they are successful. The implication in section 30 is that people are engaging in something improper by taking personal injury claims. People should be allowed to take such actions without fear of any damage to their reputations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1629">The Internet gives rise to a major problem in that it is available to all and sundry. As stated on Committee Stage, the name, address and occupation of a person taking a claim will be listed on the Internet and they might then receive all types of spam and unsolicited mail. I am not an expert in computers but I am aware that the term "Intranet" usually refers to an internal network. If such a network could be made available only to those who operate within the courts system and if a company wished to check whether someone had made numerous claims, they could do so through their solicitors or barristers. That might be a way to make the material listed in the section available to those who are legal practitioners rather than to the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1630">If awards are made in cases, they become public knowledge. That is not the position in this instance, however, because the details of those who have made claims of any sort, regardless of whether they were successful, withdrawn or whatever, will be listed on the register.

          <p eId="para_1651">This is another issue which we dealt with in some depth on Committee Stage. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure client confidentiality, which is a basic principle of law recognised by the Irish courts. It is also part of European Community law and the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, it is a long established principle of common law. The principle is justified because it ensures clients are able to consult solicitors without fear that their communication will be disclosed to third parties or used as evidence in court. It is vital that nothing compromises client confidentiality. There is a danger that pressure would be brought to bear on clients and their solicitors to disclose information, which up to now would not have been required, in the way the legislation is currently drafted. The amendment would ensure solicitors would not be in breach of their professional duties to keep the relationship between solicitors and clients private.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_784">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1652">What we are talking about here is a requirement by certain persons to provide information to the new PIAB. We discussed this at length on Committee Stage and I had hoped the Minister would consider the points raised. There are serious problems with the requirement to furnish information which might breach solicitor and client confidentiality. To a large degree, our system has been based on such confidentiality, going back to the first establishment of attorneys some 100 years ago. Client confidentiality is recognised in the Irish courts and the law of the European Community. It would also contravene the European Convention on Human Rights. However, I accept that the matter is subject to all the requirements of justice. If there were matters of a criminal nature, perhaps confidentiality would be capable of being breached but in normal civil matters it has been recognised at all times that a solicitor has a professional duty to keep confidential all matters coming within the solicitor and client relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1653">To require solicitors to disclose records of documents to the PIAB would be a significant encroachment on the principle of client confidentiality. We should not do so without examining the proposal with great care. Solicitor and client confidentiality should not be breached except by order of a court or by a tribunal. The notion that a board could, of its own volition, require the production of documents or information from solicitors, which could lead to an encroachment on the principle of solicitor and client confidentiality, is something I find very difficult to accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_1654">Although I am a non-practising member of the legal profession I am not here to defend the interests of the legal profession. The intention is to seek to defend the interests of those who rely on the legal profession. I am seeking to defend the client's interest. This could lead to unwelcome consequences. I urge the Minister to reflect on the background to this and accept that this principle should not be breached in this fashion. Client confidentiality could probably be regarded as a constitutional right. A person should be able to have confidence in his or her relationship with a lawyer. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights relates to the right to privacy. I feel very strongly that this fundamental change should not be introduced in this fashion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_785">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1655">I understood the Minister had agreed to reflect on the matter overnight. Something of this nature should not be put into legislation. The principle of client-lawyer confidentiality is contained within existing legislation. It is a bit like the confessional where anybody going to priests in the confessional can disclose information, or be asked to disclose it, but the exchange is conducted in a confidential and private fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1656">Section 54A requires:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1657">The Board may require any person (including a Minister of the Government or a body established by or under any enactment) to provide it with such records, documents or information as it may reasonably require for the purposes of the performance of its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1658">If the board can require the client to provide all the documents it requires for the purpose of the performance of its function it does not need to interfere with the client-lawyer relationship. Any documents that are relevant can be got from the other source. I do not see why the legislation should intrude on that particular confidentiality and privacy. This provision will cause considerable difficulties among the legal profession in terms of its code of conduct. It should not come as any surprise to the Minister that the Law Society is not happy with the provision. The Law Society's guide to professional conduct for solicitors states that a solicitor has a professional duty to keep confidential all matters coming within the solicitor-client relationship, including the existence of that relationship. All of that would be breached straight away by this provision. The guidelines also state that these matters can only be disclosed with the consent of the client or by direction of a court. If we put this provision in legislation it would be difficult to maintain it on a constitutional basis and in terms of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is not worth going down that road for the difficulty it would cause in terms of being questioned by the legal profession and civil liberty bodies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_786">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1659">Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Costello have put their fingers on the matter. The legal professional privilege is a constitutional matter. Confidentiality in these matters is probably guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights. This has two consequences, first, any statute must be construed in a constitutional manner and, second, as a matter of statute law, this Bill, when it becomes law, must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1660">It is worth considering the purposes for which this information may be sought. The new section 54A states: "The Board [the Personal Injuries Assessment Board] may require any person (including a Minister of the Government or a body established by or under any enactment) to provide it with such records, documents or information as it may reasonably [the word "reasonably" must also be put into the balance] require for the purposes of the performance of its functions under section 54(1)(<i>c</i>).” Section 54 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 sets out the principal functions of the PIAB. Section 54(1)(<i>c</i>) states that one of the principal functions shall be “to cause a cost benefit analysis to be made of the legal procedures and the associated processes (including those provided for by this Act) that are currently employed in the State for the purpose of awarding compensation for personal injuries”. This means the PIAB has power to require persons to give it records from time to time to calculate the cost benefit analysis of one system versus another.</p>
          <p eId="para_1661">In that context, I can say as a matter of certainty, as a matter of constitutional construction, that it could not possibly be used as an attempt to breach lawyer-client privilege. This is because it would have to be reasonably required for a cost benefit analysis and I cannot imagine any circumstance in which in any individual case the information exchange between a solicitor and his client under privilege would be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1662">In addition, in any event this section must be constitutionally construed. I agree with Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Costello that this measure is one which cannot trench on a constitutional right and therefore it could not be applied in a circumstance which would seem to authorise a breach of a constitutional right. Even if somebody were disposed to baldly interpret it in that way and ignore the Constitution, which I reject as a hypothesis, it would have to be reasonably done. In those circumstances, clearly, a solicitor who refused access to a privileged confidential file on the basis that it could not possibly be reasonably necessary for a cost benefit analysis of the State's personal injuries system could claim in any event on a reasonable construction that it would not be reasonable to breach privilege for that purpose. On all those grounds the notion that the constitutional right could be infringed by a statute in these circumstances is misguided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1663">The other problem I have in accepting the amendment would be that it would be too particular. Earlier Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to <i>“expressio unius est exclusio alterius”.</i> Based on that maxim, to say that it does not apply to the disclosure by a solicitor of records, which would fall into either of those categories, would tend to imply that it would apply to virtually everybody else. It would apply to plaintiffs who had documents in their possession, doctors’ medical records of their patients and insurance companies that might have copies of these files in filing cabinets, which is not what this is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1664">I again refer to the original section in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act, in which the PIAB is given powers to conduct these cost benefit analyses. The purpose of this section is to require people to assist it in carrying out those investigations by producing records in their possession. For instance, it would apply to the Master of the High Court, who, as an officeholder, is not in a position to refuse to show documents in his possession to the PIAB on the basis that it is not entitled to know what happens in his court. It is no application for documents which are secret any more than the Master of the High Court could direct somebody to hand up a privileged opinion. The same applies to the PIAB. It cannot request solicitors to hand over privileged documentation. On any rule or cannon of construction of a statute, it could not be interpreted as authorising the PIAB to breach lawyer-client confidentiality because that is constitutionally guaranteed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1665">In the circumstances the Deputies might ask why I would not accept the amendment if this is the case. If I were to accept it, it would imply that it was necessary to accept it and that this kind of document or person must be protected from this measure. If I accept that, I am stuck with the problem that it does not even refer to barristers, insurance companies, claims managers, loss adjusters, doctors, psychiatrists and many others who could not reasonably be required by the PIAB to hand over personal confidential material to it in these circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1666">There may be a problem in introducing a reference in a Bill to another Act, on which most of us are not focused. This section is solely concerned with cost benefit analyses of our system of law. It has nothing to do with arguing about whether an individual case was rightly or wrongly decided or whether the plaintiff got €3,000 or €4,000 in any individual case. It is to do with the broader question of information flows, which should be made available to the PIAB so that it can carry out cost benefit analyses of the present system of personal injuries compensation law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1667">Having thought about it overnight, I believe it would be retrograde to accept the amendment as it would imply that, but for the amendment, this power could have had the effect of allowing the PIAB to attempt to breach lawyer-client privilege, which is not the case. This section could not be construed in that way because to allow it to be construed in that way or to admit that otherwise it could be construed in that way would suggest that it could be construed in a manner which is unconstitutional, and I cannot accept that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1672">The Minister is correct, we are really dealing with another Act altogether. Having this type of debate in the context of another Act is difficult for a start. What the PIAB would do under section 54(1)(<i>c</i>) would be a cost benefit analysis of legal procedures and surely there would be no better place to start than in solicitors’ offices looking for files to see how effective the system is. The intent may be right, the approach may be not in any way to invade the privacy of individual clients but, in effect, that would be the consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1673">The second point of the Minister, of including one and excluding another is possibly a stronger argument. If we had time for more considered debate on the issue, I would like to see that section amended in a way that would exclude any documents or records held on a confidential basis by anybody. That obviously would include people, such as doctors and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1674">I am concerned about the issue. For the Minister to merely say that there is an implication that it would be unconstitutional and in breach of the European Convention to require documentation from solicitors is not a very strong answer to the case made.</p>

          <p eId="para_1675">If there is a chance that the privilege aspect will be breached under this section, we should accept the amendment. If a solicitor or a body refuses to comply with this requirement, what is the penalty? None, as far as I can see, is mentioned in the legislation, which makes the requirement seem strange. A question has been raised. I know we can all say certain matters will be subject to a constitutional challenge, but in this case professional confidentiality is a long-standing tradition and has been upheld by the European Court of Human Rights to be part of the rights of privacy. Client confidentiality has been part of common law for the past 150 years and we should ensure that remains the case. A major crisis or events as mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe might persuade a solicitor to break that confidentiality, but if client-solicitor confidentiality was breached it would bring a solicitor's professional standing into question. Will the Minister respond to the question of penalties, if there are penalties?</p>

          <p eId="para_1676">It is a strange power the Minister is giving to the PIAB that documents, records and information must be disclosed even though it is within the ambit of section 54 (1)(<i>c</i>). The purpose of a cost benefit analysis is one matter but the substance of the information, documents and records is another matter. While they may provide information in regard to a cost benefit analysis, they might also provide information on other confidential matters. One will not necessarily get unadulterated cost benefit documentation that has no relation to the lawyer-client relationship. I do not know of any other situation where a private firm can be compelled to give details of its business operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1677">The ESRI and NESC operates on material that is voluntarily provided by the business sector on their audits and end of term published documents on their business. This provision seems to be a trawl of each individual firm or individuals as the case may be to provide documents. What will happen to the documents? How will they know what documents will be provided? As Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked, what penalties will apply, will there be officers similar to glimmer men checking to see whether the exact document was supplied? Rather than delving into the internal documents of professional people, in this case lawyers and clients, would it not be better to establish a mechanism for an end of year statement that would be part of a code of conduct rather than a statutory requirement?</p>
          <p eId="para_1678">I think the Minister will run into difficult issues on confidentiality and privacy because one cannot separate documents in a clear-cut black and white fashion. It may be simpler to accept what is being proposed by Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Jim O'Keeffe, if disclosure will be unconstitutional if the documents are in breach of privilege. That is what is stated in the amendment and it would be a clear statement of intent.</p>

That would cover all professions and would make it explicit and clear that it is not envisaged that professional privilege would be breached by anybody.

If one interprets it as saying that the PIAB can invade the constitutional rights of people, the Deputy is missing the point. The PIAB will be entitled to get records relating to taxation of costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1683">As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe knows well, a Bill of taxation does not contain legal professional privilege matters. It might be something which, in the ordinary course of events, a solicitor would be obliged by professional rules to keep confidential. However, I want to make it clear that it is not necessary to provide in respect of the exercise of any statutory power that it cannot be done in an unconstitutional manner. There is a fundamental rule of construction that no statute of this House may be interpreted in a way which apparently authorises an unconstitutional act. The provisions of every Bill passed, when they become law, must be construed in a manner that is compatible with the Constitution. I am quite happy that it is not necessary to provide this measure and it would tend to suggest, if such a provision were not made, that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board could behave in an unconstitutional manner. I am unhappy with that whole vista.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_805">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1706">I am grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle because recommittal to Committee Stage makes it easier to range across the series of amendments tabled. Amendment No. 34 in the name of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is not really necessary as regards the <i>in camera</i> rule because there is nothing in that which affects the publication of aggregate data. For example the Courts Service publishes the numbers of various orders sought, the numbers granted and the like in family law matters which are <i>in camera</i>. The <i>in camera</i> rule is not seen to prevent aggregate data of that nature from being published, as matters stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707">Another feature of the Deputy's amendment is that if it was to be inserted as a new sub-paragraph (<i>a</i>) in subsection (2), the proviso would not quite make sense because it would refer to “the disclosure or publication of data or results of research conducted relating to proceedings” and then one would say, “provided that the report or judgment does not contain any information which would enable the parties to the proceedings, or any child to which the proceedings relate, to be identified”. There would be a technical problem, even if it was necessary to have an authorisation for aggregate research data of that kind to be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1708">Regarding the amendments in my name, it is unclear from the section as it stands who may attend and report these proceedings. Amendment No. 35 in my name provides that it is to be either a barrister or a solicitor, and I am not trying to create a monopoly for lawyers, "or a person falling within any other class of persons specified in regulations made by the Minister". What I have in mind is that having consulted with the Courts Service and interested parties, I would be in a position to identify by class types of people who should be entitled to carry out this function of preparing reports or recording judgments which are appropriate and sustainable. I do not feel this should be confined to practising or even non-practising lawyers. It should be capable of being extended to other categories in the community, but I do not at this stage have an explicit list in my head that I can commit to. Therefore I believe it is better to leave it to be decided by regulations which I would have to table before this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1709">Amendment No. 36 provides that rules of court are to be made to regulate the reporting process. It inserts the term, "in accordance with the rules of court". To go back to the point Deputy Costello was making about me arrogating powers to myself, I believe on this occasion that it is appropriate for the Judiciary, which runs courts, to operate in accordance with the rules of court established by rules committees. Anybody who exercises the function of attending at and reporting on family law cases should in that capacity be capable of being made subject to rules of court. It is not satisfactory that people should decide in favour of that function being carried out in a manner that is not capable of being regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1710">Amendment No. 37 provides that a person of the class referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>), a solicitor or barrister or a person of the class specified in regulations can attend the court for the purpose of reporting. The amendment also gives the court a measure of control over the attendance of the reporter at the proceedings. I do not want to get into too much detail about this, but I can imagine, for instance, very intimate details of a sexual relationship being discussed in the context of a matrimonial case. It might well be that the presiding judge would decide that it was not acceptable in such circumstances for somebody to be present, listening to the proceedings and seriously inhibiting or embarrassing the parties involved. That is just an example. In cases of great privacy, the presiding judge should be given some leeway to ensure that witnesses can give evidence without undue intrusion from others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1711">The acceptance of amendment No. 39, in the name of Deputy Ó Snodaigh, would make the process of reporting subject to a great deal of bureaucracy, such as ministerial regulations and accreditation by the Courts Service. My approach, which has roughly the same aim, achieves the desired result in a slightly more flexible manner. I am opposed to giving "bona fide academic researchers", as they are called in the amendment, access to court files on the basis that anything published would not contain information that would identify people, as the amendment suggests. It is proposed that the identity of the parties would be known to so-called bona fide researchers but they would not be allowed to publish the details.</p>
          <p eId="para_1712">Frankly, private information can be a problem. For example, the intimate details of the private life of a well-known celebrity — a politician or somebody else — and his or her spouse may be written down in documentary form. It is no great comfort to somebody in such circumstances to know that researchers can rifle through the relevant documents but cannot publish anything that identifies him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713">If researchers are writing a biography of the well-known person, they can use the material indirectly to influence the picture the public has of him or her. It is possible that the permitted access to such documents would be abused in that way. I do not favour giving "bona fide academic researchers" access to <i>in camera</i> proceedings <i>per se</i>. Instead, we should aim to put in place a system whereby relevant material can be placed in the public domain, allowing all potential users — researchers, students or departmental officials — access to it on the same basis. I do not think people should have a total right to sit on a case because they have branded themselves “bona fide academic researchers”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714">I understand the objective of amendment No. 43. The provision proposed in the amendment will be included in the Bill, in effect, if my amendments are accepted. News reports of family cases which identify parties are not permitted at present. Given that family law judgments in the superior courts often appear in law reports with the identities of the parties concealed, it is clear that nothing prohibits such material from appearing in the news media. No such prohibition should exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715">The approach in this section is to permit certain actions which are currently prohibited. If my amendments are accepted, the attendance in court of a barrister, solicitor or member of such class of persons as prescribed in ministerial regulations will be permitted for the purpose of preparing a report. The attendance of other persons such as journalists will not be permitted unless they are prescribed persons. I do not intend to prescribe persons by category. While I understand the thinking behind amendment No. 43, I am of the view that the approach I am adopting will adequately take care of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1716">The proposal in amendment No. 46 to prescribe by regulation persons who can publish reports is adequately taken care of in amendment No. 35. If we follow the line I am suggesting, it is probably unnecessary to prescribe the categories of person who may publish reports. If the category of reporters has been established and the relevant ground rule has been set down, the question of what category of person goes on to publish the material seems to me to be of little importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1717">It could be argued that amendment No. 49, in the name of Deputy Ó Snodaigh, proposes a somewhat over-regulatory approach. The Deputy is calling for guidelines to be prescribed "on venues and times for hearings, and the persons permitted to attend". My amendment takes care of the part of the amendment relating to "the persons permitted to attend". I am worried that the suggested approach is too heavy-handed and would involve too much preliminary work. If it is adopted, we will never get around to making information available about what is actually happening in the family courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1718">The amendment also calls on the Minister to ensure by regulation that "the provisions under this section operate consistently in all family courts established in the State". I have to say that the Minister could not do that very well. It is not the type of provision we should pursue lightly. We all agree that provisions should be made to allow the use of the material in question in other tribunals. There is no major problem in that regard.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1719">We have to take the Minister on trust to a certain degree because we have not really had a chance to assess fully the effect of his amendments. We all agree on the common objective of ensuring that we cater for the provision of responsible reports for the purpose of building a body of jurisprudence for appropriate purposes. We are trying to ensure that the sensitivities of family law cases are not subject to day-to-day reporting. They should certainly not be the subject of sensationalism or intrusion of any kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1720">The amendment I proposed represented an attempt to achieve a delicate balance. I will bow to the Minister's comment that he and his officials are trying to achieve the same objective, by taking on board the various representations made and concerns expressed about this area. I hope the new provisions will achieve the balance we are aiming for. On that basis, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment and to agree to the amendments proposed by the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_807">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1721">I wish to speak on the general thrust of the Minister's amendments which have given us a great deal to think about. He is proposing to expand the Bill's original provisions by focusing on various areas, such as how reportage can take place. I did not know that data can be compiled at present and I do not think many people are aware of it. I understand there have been difficulties with the compilation of data by researchers because it had been done on a pilot basis in the family courts, but that has been stopped to some extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1722">I am not sure whether a particular process or code of conduct operates in that regard or whether the courts have been feeling their way in that regard, but we need to be clear on that aspect of it if we are seeking to put in place a corpus of jurisprudence in respect of sensitive court matters, such as family law, domestic violence and rape cases, which have not been reported in any significant way until now. I would like to see a clearer mechanism in respect of the co-operation of the courts in this regard. How will judges respond? How will the Courts Service deal with the matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_1723">I would have thought a better approach could have been adopted. The Minister is arrogating some areas to himself by way of amendment No. 38 which provides that one of the Minister's functions will be to prohibit a party to proceedings, "from supplying copies of, or extracts from, orders made in the proceedings".</p>
          <p eId="para_1724">The Minister will proscribe the conditions, therefore. In section 36 the Minister will allow the matter to be dealt with in accordance with the rules of court. Would it not be better for a code of conduct in this area to be developed under the auspices of the Courts Service, which the Minister would then approve? There are many elements in this. We are talking about the research and data side, how the reporting will take place and the people who will do the reporting. Will it be academics on the one hand authorised by the Minister or barristers and solicitors on the other, or perhaps the two will be the same in many areas? We are talking also about those who will attend the court, the way people will be accompanied in court and the extent to which the material that is obtained will be used in terms of who can and cannot be identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1725">There is need for a broad code of conduct in this area that is wider than the statutory provision determination. It should be the remit of the Courts Service to provide that code of conduct, which the Minister would then approve. That might be changed from time to time because this has not been done before and it is an extraordinarily sensitive area. Whereas it is easy for us to say that individual persons should not be identified in this legislation, we are talking about a very small country. It is difficult to keep matters private in many cases and details may emerge that will enable identification to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1726">From time to time the principles of a code of conduct might need to be changed or indeed the practicalities of it. I am not saying anything against the Minister's proposal, which is a good one although I see a certain dichotomy in that the Minister is allowing the rules of court to prevail in one instance while arrogating approval to himself in another. It might be better for the Minister to stand back and allow the courts determine the code of procedure and behaviour, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would approve, and that could be changed from time to time as circumstances would require.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">We are travelling untilled ground in this respect and we are not sure how these provisions will work in practice. They may work well but they may need to be changed, and that could be more easily done if there was a sufficiently broad provision to allow a mechanism be put in place for doing it.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1728">Having listened to the Minister I understand some of the problems with the amendments I have submitted. As I said earlier, they were prepared in a rush. If I had the time I would have tidied them up somewhat and they would not be so bureaucratic. The reference to bona fide academic research does not necessarily mean that somebody can declare themselves as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_1729">The material I have listed in amendment No. 40 must be gathered to allow the judgments, so to speak, to be made on how the system is working and ensure we have proper statistics on that area. It is to allow the profession to extrapolate, collate and make sense of statistics, which we need from the courts system. I am not saying barristers or solicitors cannot do that but sometimes it is done by researchers, statisticians and so on. Perhaps that is covered by the Minister's inclusion of "any other class of persons".</p>
          <p eId="para_1730">The person who should be mainly responsible for the collating and processing of all this material should be an officer of the court, somebody from the Courts Service. I am not saying a barrister at law or solicitor cannot do it but it should be somebody who is accountable to the Minister or, at the very least, to the Courts Service in light of what other speakers and the Minister raised in regard to personal details being used or abused in different circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">On the second reading of my amendment No. 49 I admit it is slightly convoluted, so to speak, but the intention was that family courts should sit in courts, not in hotels, backrooms or whatever, and that the same type of facilities should be available in all of them. This is in line with my other amendment but the main point is that the same facilities should be available in every family court. The courts should sit at a time which is conducive to their working properly and we do not have criminal courts sitting for two hours in the morning and then the family courts sitting in the afternoon. A different time should be allocated to family courts. That was the intention behind my amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted in amendment No. 39 that parties to proceedings can make use of the reports, or extracts, for other proceedings only. I welcome the approach of the Minister. For once he is sticking to the programme for Government which stated that changes would be made to the <i>in camera</i> rule. That is to be welcomed. Time does not allow us to debate that aspect fully but in general I take the Minister at his word on this one.</p>

          <p eId="para_1733">I have sympathy for the approach Deputy Costello suggested, namely, that I should ask the Courts Service to devise guidelines, consent to them and then they would be effective. My problem is that some of the people who are complaining about the <i>in camera</i> rule — I do not want to exaggerate their position — appear to think the Courts Service is against them and that if I simply surrendered to the Courts Service all these functions and they did not like the result they would say, “Isn’t that typical? We complain about the Courts Service and the Minister asks the Courts Service to address the problem but it does nothing”. They then see it as an Establishment conspiracy against which they rage and say we are not doing the right thing.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1738">There is a problem in maintaining the confidence of all the people who are subject to family law. Like many litigants in family law I would love to know the track record of individual judges — is this a judge who always holds for the father or never holds for the father? There is a lot of information that one would, in theory, like to know. Would it be fair, for instance, to say of a particular judge that in 83% of domestic violence cases he had held for the mother? Is that the kind of information we really want to know? At one level many people would say they want it clearly known that a certain judge is pro-wife or whatever. The problem with that kind of evaluation system is that it would give rise to the worst kind of pressures on judges. It would be like school league tables and would give rise to all manner of unintended consequences. Transparency gives rise to considerable pressure on people to conform to public expectations. Do we need to know if a judge, softer than others on a particular aspect of family law, gives out larger shares of a spouse's property to the other in divorce proceedings? Do we want comparative tables in our newspapers stating that judge X is soft while judge Y is as hard as nails? I do not know if that it is a positive development. I need to be convinced that this type of research is positive rather than negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1739">This is a first step that may well be revisited by the House. However, we live in a world where, to quote the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the goddess OTA — openness, transparency and accountability — is worshipped in many quarters. By the same token, the consumers of family law services, as provided by the Judiciary as part of the administration of justice, must have a sense of confidence that openness, transparency and accountability will not destroy their lives. While a delicate balance must be achieved, I will concede we are groping in the dark.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740">The changes made during the passage of the Bill may not be perfect and may create problems in future. However, I do not want an unintended consequence where people lose faith in their capacity to go to court. For example, husbands and wives with matrimonial problems must not feel they cannot go to court because the issue will end up in the public domain. That would be the worst of the outcomes. Bad and all as matrimonial breakdown is, believing that one could not invoke the courts to help out would be ten times worse. I prefer to guarantee the House that this legislation will be revisited in two years' time. There are always courts Bills going through the Oireachtas, such as those to increase the number of judges. If this needs to be fine-tuned in the light of experience, there will be opportunities to do so.</p>

            <from>Dr. Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_1767">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the many innovations that have occurred recently in food processing and development, and particularly in packaging. The consumer clearly stands to benefit very significantly from these developments but there is a need for caution in their application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">One must ensure that while valuable information is provided to consumers, they are protected against any potential risk that might arise from the innovations. I speak in particular of what are called active and intelligent packaging developments. These are just two of the innovations. Active packaging allows the release of approved additives into a foodstuff to control the growth of pathogens and of soilage bacteria. This prolongs the shelf life of the food and makes it safe. However, it also allows one to know the food is safe or spoiled, so that in the latter case the consumer is unlikely to eat it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">Intelligent packaging makes use of specific indicators which will allow consumers to determine, for example, the freshness of a food by means of a colour change in the packaging. Such changes in the packaging would be reversible and would let the consumer know that the product was not suitable for consumption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">The real issue is that the consumer must be assured that the innovative development is also safe. The safety of the indicators, whether they are called active or intelligent packaging or anything else, must be guaranteed. Recent EU regulations allow the use of such systems. This issue is primarily one of food safety and consumer protection. When I put the question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food this week in order to ascertain his views, I was told it was a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is correct. It is, however, an anomalous situation whereby packaging of food, which has implications for consumer safety and food protection, is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is not a trade issue but one of health and food safety. I am asking that the Food Safety Authority be charged with responsibility for ensuring the safety of food, specifically with regard to active and intelligent packaging. That authority should be given a pro-active role in policing and enforcing that legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">The substantial matter is the responsibility for food packaging and it is inappropriate that it rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We are talking of plastic materials in contact with foodstuffs and the possibility of migration of those materials into the food. The food industry and researchers will clearly have a significant responsibility and will undoubtedly take it seriously in ensuring that any materials in contact with the food are safe for human consumption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">This involves a policing and enforcement issue. The responsibility must change. Plastic materials in contact with food with the possible risk of migration should be rigorously policed. It is illogical and inappropriate that this responsibility now rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Department has no role, nor should it have, in food safety responsibility. That should be transferred to the Food Safety Authority which reports to the Department of Health and Children, or alternatively to a Department of food with full responsibility for all food related matters, including food safety.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1773">I thank Deputy Upton for raising this important matter. Food contact materials are all materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, including packaging materials but also cutlery, dishes, processing machines, containers and so on. All food contact materials can potentially transfer some of their constituents into the food they contact, a phenomenon called migration. To protect consumers' health, food contact materials should be safe and should not transfer their components into the foodstuff in unacceptable quantities. In recognition of this potential risk, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998 establishes controls on the use of food contact materials. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for enforcement of the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">The potential contamination of food arising from food contact materials is an area where continual industry diligence and official controls are essential to minimise the threat to public health and confidence in the safety of the food we eat. Recent incidents such as the contamination of baby food with substances migrating from packaging materials highlight the potentially serious nature of the problem. The FSAI has requested the European Food Safety Authority to ensure that rigorous toxicological assessments are carried out on substances used to manufacture food contact materials including consideration of their degradation qualities. The laboratory facilities for testing food contact materials for compliance with this regulation have improved in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">At European level there is an existing Council Directive 89/109/EEC, termed the framework directive, which established general principles relating to materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, such as the principle of inertness of the materials. It also established that specific directives would be introduced for certain groups of materials such as plastics, paper and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">In November 2003 the European Commission introduced a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council to replace the framework directive. This new regulation is intended to take account of substantial technological developments in the area of food packaging in the past number of years. The regulation is intended as a general framework for food contact materials and sets out the general principles that should apply to all packaging. The regulation establishes some general rules of traceability for food contact materials in line with similar provisions for food and feed set out in Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002, though there is a two-year delay before these provisions apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">The regulation also establishes a more detailed, transparent procedure for the safety assessment by the European Food Safety Authority and authorisation by the Commission of substances to be used in the manufacture of food contact materials. The regulation extended the list of materials that could be subject to specific controls, adding active materials and intelligent packaging that can give consumers information on the condition of the food, ionexchange resins, adhesives and printing inks, as well as food contact materials made from recycled materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">The regulation also seeks to support member states' enforcement of the rules on food contact materials through the Community reference laboratory and the national reference laboratories established by the Regulation (EC) No. 88/2004 on official controls that are performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules. The proposal was actively promoted by the Irish EU Presidency and a compromise text reflecting intensive discussions in the early part of this year was approved by the European Parliament on 31 March 2004. It is expected that the regulation will be formally adopted by the Council of Ministers very soon when the text is available in all the official languages of the EU. At that stage it will be published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> and will come into force 20 days later. From then on the measure will apply in all member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">The main concern over the proposal in the European Parliament and among member states was over the introduction into the scope of the regulation of certain active packaging systems that are designed to release substances such as food additives into packaged food after it has left the food factory. At present this packaging cannot be introduced into the EU because the packaging must be inert. Amendments were agreed to specify some general principles that should apply to active packaging. For example, the food industry must be informed of substances deliberately released from active packaging, and these must be identified on the label as if they were food ingredients. These should ensure that consumers are not misled about either the packaging or the condition of the packaged food they purchase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">Active packaging would only be permitted to release substances already authorised as food additives. Further requirements will be detailed in the specific legislation to be drafted by the Commission. Public health will be a primary concern in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">The new regulation provides for technological developments in regard to manufacturing of food contact materials that have taken place such as the development of active and intelligent packaging. It also introduces traceability requirements in regard to food contact materials. The enhanced role given to EFSA should increase consumer protection and confidence in food safety. It will be necessary to amend the European Communities (Materials and Articles Intended to Come into Contact with Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1991 to 2003. This would be to provide that non-compliance with the new Regulation would be an offence under Irish regulations, and to establish sanctions for non-compliance.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_834">
            <from>Mr. Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_1782">I welcome the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. I wish to highlight a situation which has developed in Roscommon but which I am sure is applicable in some other areas where there are outbreaks of brucellosis and TB. The motion is that the Minister review upwards the reference prices compiled by the Department of Agriculture and Food on the live valuation for suckler cows under the disease eradication scheme. Reference prices compiled weekly by the Department of Agriculture and Food and issued to valuers are not reflected in the prices being achieved in the market for quality suckler cows in particular. Farmers having suckler cows removed under the disease eradication scheme are losing between €300 and €400 per head on good quality cows. It could be argued that this is in direct contravention of what was agreed under the PPF in regard to the on-farm valuation scheme. It is important that the spirit of this scheme be honoured in full and that market prices are paid for all animals removed under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">While cattle prices in general have increased since 1 January, the reference price index has not increased. The Minister could and should intervene. In some cases, the value of an inferior suckler cow can be obtained but to replace good quality cows often comes at a cost of €300 to €400 per head to farmers, who should get a realistic market value for their cows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">County Roscommon is unfortunate in that the south part of the county had a major outbreak of brucellosis, particularly in the moor area. Just two weeks ago, a farmer told me that eight of his cows had been removed. He believed he would have to substitute the replacement to the tune of perhaps €2,000 to €2,500, which he could not afford. Farming is important in County Roscommon, which has more than 8,000 farmers and many full-time farmers with suckler cow herds. It is unfortunate that there are two disease outbreaks at present, of brucellosis in one part of the county and TB in another.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">There is serious resulting hardship among farmers. I have discussed the matter at length with IFA officials and other farming organisations. They asked me to bring the matter to the House to ascertain whether we could improve the lot of the farmers. Will the Minister look sympathetically at the situation of County Roscommon? While this may also be applicable to other counties, it is a matter of concern to my constituents and the farmers of Roscommon.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeWalsh" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_835">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
            <p eId="para_1786">By way of background, I should explain that in the context of negotiations leading to the agreement on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it was agreed to introduce an on-farm market valuation scheme for cattle removed under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes. This was agreed with the farming organisations, including the IFA. In subsequent negotiations with the farming bodies, it was agreed that for the purposes of valuations, "market value" would be the price which might reasonably have been obtained for the animal at the time of determination of compensation from a purchaser in the open market. If there is a problem with on-farm valuation, there is also an appeals system and, if there is a problem with an appeal, there is an arbitration system. There are three tiers to the system in the interests of fairness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">The scheme was phased in during 2001 and was fully rolled out from April 2002 in respect of all reactor cattle disclosed at a test on or after that date. From that date, the flat reactor grant arrangements ceased to apply. However, in addition to the market valuation element, farmers whose herds are affected by these diseases may, subject to certain conditions, also qualify for assistance under the income supplement, hardship or depopulation grant schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">Accordingly, since April 2002, compensation for all reactors disclosed under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes is determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the on-farm market valuation scheme as agreed by the IFA and other farming organisations in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. All valuations are carried out by a cadre of independent valuers who value animals in accordance with the agreed market price definition. The summary of market prices document is revised each week to take account of available data on market prices. This updated document is sent each week to each valuer to assist them in their valuation work. Farmers who are not satisfied with initial valuations can appeal them and if still not satisfied after the appeal valuation, they can go to arbitration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">The valuation system is working well and there are no plans at present to make any changes to the basis on which it operates. In support of this, I would point out that more than 20,000 separate valuations have been undertaken since April 2002 and there have been very few appeals against first valuations, not to mention those referred to arbitration. For example, during 2003, some 8,585 separate valuations were completed by independent valuers in respect of some 45,000 cattle, with only 1.6% of first valuations appealed and less that 0.2% of valuations going to arbitration. The figures indicate a significant satisfaction level with the way the on-farm market valuation system operates. I will continue to keep the scheme under review but, as indicated, I believe it is working satisfactorily.</p>

          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_836">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_1790">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter. It seems extraordinary that North West Radio should have its right to broadcast removed. This decision of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland seems particularly perverse and unfair considering that North West Radio had possession of its licence for the past 14 years and has given sterling and dedicated service over this time to the general community. Were proof needed of the excellence of North West Radio, it has consistently been seen as one of the top radio stations in Ireland and winning "local radio station of the year" in 2003 speaks volumes for its content and performance. Were proof of its value to virtually every man, woman and child in the area needed, then the out-pouring of grief on its possible demise is akin to the impending death of a highly respected friend or a close relative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">The high standing and global respect that North West Radio commands across the community among all age groups is a result of good and faithful service to the community. It has given everything one would expect from a true friend and more. What friend would be there to entertain, inform, console and advise at all hours of the day and night? Who else was there to help faithful listeners through the night when calamities, such as storms, raged? Many older people regard North West Radio as their only true friend. It was a constant companion to those who were otherwise alone. It was a lifeline and a bridge from their isolation and loneliness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">The most disturbing aspect of this saga is the manner in which it happened. How could such a decision, which would have such sad and major implications for dedicated staff and avid NWR listeners, be decided almost on a whim? This was a borderline decision of the six BCI members present at a meeting. It was a 3:3 split decision, with the second and deciding vote of the BCI chairman putting an end to an extraordinary public service and epic performance by a gifted and dedicated team. Where were the other members of the BCI when such an important decision was being made? They should have been there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">This is an amazing situation, a borderline decision in favour of an unknown quantity on grounds which are far from convincing. This has totally undermined public confidence in the BCI. Surely a station which holds the broadcasting rights for so many years should have an automatic entitlement to retain that licence to broadcast indefinitely, except in the most exceptional circumstances. Surely this is logical and necessary, given the considerable investment required in blood, sweat and tears as well as hard cash to sustain such a high class and effective radio station. If broadcasters have no certainty about the future of their operation and have to depend on a wing and a prayer as to whether they will be able to continue to broadcast, the result will be lower standards and mediocre radio stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">The overwhelming feeling is that the BCI has done a gross disservice to the people who listen to North West Radio. There should be a review process with strictly outlined rules. Anything less is arbitrary and unfair. The lack of an appeal system against decisions of the BCI is a travesty of justice. The limitations of any recourse to the legal route are, unfortunately, only too obvious. It is up to public representatives to demand a solution to this situation by seeking changes in the legislation, if that is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">I am seeking answers from the Minister as to what will be done about the injustice visited on North West Radio, the reform of the BCI and the steps being taken to provide a proper appeal system against BCI decisions. The powers of the Ombudsman should be extended to cover BCI decisions. One stated reason for the loss of the licence is shared programming. These shared programmes are the most popular radio programmes in Ireland. Tommy Marren, Paul Claffey and Gerry Glennon are bigger stars than Gay Byrne ever was. More people listen to them and one cannot get more local than that. The chairman of the BCI's reason for opting for the other crowd was that they had a vision for the needs of a greater number of listeners in the area over the next ten years. That vision is a case of the blind leading the blind. The reality is that everybody listens to North West Radio.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">The system is there, or should be there, to serve the people. If the system is deficient and does not serve the people, it should be scrapped. Justice demands that North West Radio should retain its broadcast licence. What will the Minister do to ensure justice and fair play for North West Radio? The people of the north-west demand that the Minister act on this. I demand it too, as their elected representative.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_837" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food">
            <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
            <p eId="para_1797">I thank Deputy Cowley for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is an independent statutory body and the Minister has no role in its licensing decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">Last year, the Minister announced his intention to carry out a fundamental review of radio licensing in Ireland. The purpose of the review is to examine all aspects of radio licensing, including what is licensed and the processes through which licences are awarded, and to make recommendations for the future. Within this context, the workings of the commission and issues concerning appeals procedures in radio licensing decisions are being considered. The first stage of the review process was a comprehensive study of radio licensing in Ireland carried out by industry experts. That report is now completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">The Minister now intends to hold a public consultation process on the full range of issues <i>vis-à-vis</i> radio licensing in Ireland. The purpose of this public consultation is to seek the views of stakeholders. The consultants’ report will be released as part of the public consultation. The public consultation process will commence within a few days. After completion of this process, the Minister will develop proposals on how the radio licensing regime in Ireland can be improved. Such changes will be considered in the context of proposals to establish the broadcasting authority of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">The consultants' report examines an extensive range of topics in the context of radio licensing in Ireland. These include the Irish radio broadcasting market, media policy issues, radio broadcasting economics and radio licensing procedures. The consultants also include detail on licensing procedures in other jurisdictions. Drawing on the consultants' report, the public consultation will seek views on all the key issues. These include overall policy objectives for the independent sector, issues around diversity and plurality, the citizen's voice, all aspects of the licensing process, enforcement of licence conditions, financial returns to the State and the possibilities available from digital radio. All aspects of the licensing process are key topics for consultation. The Minister will seek views on the different components of the licensing process, including the application procedures and the evaluation procedures, and on the options for future appeals procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">With regard to the specific issue of appeals, the Minister recognises that at present there is no opportunity for appeal against a decision by the commission to award a licence, other than an appeal through the courts on grounds of process. While the Minister wishes to avoid the creation of a second tier of decision making in the licence award process, he recognises that the importance of the licence award decision may merit some form of appeals outlet. The Minister will seek opinions from interested parties on the options for the development of a suitable appeals process through the public consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">It is appropriate to mention at this juncture that a radio licensing appeals process, if developed, would be available to all applicants for radio licences. It would be the case, therefore, that proposed new entrants to radio who did not win licences may be entitled to appeal the granting of a new licence to the incumbent. As such, an appeals process would not be confined to existing licence holders only.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">The licensing of local radio services is obviously a sensitive matter. This is particularly so where an existing local radio station fails to win a new licence. The only way to avoid hard decisions and controversy would be to grant licences in perpetuity. While licence holders might welcome this, it would obviously not be in the public interest. It follows that there will inevitably be cases where licensees who have provided a high-quality service will still lose out where there is strong competition for a new licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">In summary, the Minister intends that the comprehensive review he is undertaking will fully examine both the licensing role of the commission and the options for licensing appeals procedures. The public consultation planned in this regard will allow for a wide range of proposals to be considered. I believe local radio is providing a superb service. It has filled a gap, particularly in rural and peripheral areas, that is not covered by the national broadcasting service. The listenership figures prove that it is providing an essential service. The stations also provide a service for our democracy. It is difficult for people in rural areas to get issues of concern raised and heard through the national broadcasting service but that facility is available through the local radio service. I am a great admirer of the service throughout the country and strongly support the concept that a formal appeals system be put in place. That is the intention of the Minister.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_838">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_1805">I am grateful for the opportunity to present this case again in the House. It is ironic that the Ceann Comhairle, as a medical practitioner, should be present for this debate as well as the Minister of State with whom I worked for a considerable time on the premier health board in the country at the time, the Eastern Health Board. There we dealt with the same issues that are before the House tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">I raise this matter not for political reasons but out of a sense of alarm. It has come to my attention that there appears to be nobody in control at Naas, James Connolly and Peamount hospitals. Let us take the example of Naas General Hospital. A major refurbishment and expansion initiative was undertaken at Naas General Hospital by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and subsequently advanced by the present Minister. The Taoiseach said this morning that the Government built the hospitals. In this case the money was provided by the previous Government. It is sad that everything seems to have ended with the expansion. The Minister of State is shaking his head. The original cost was €21 million. The project was delayed for two years by the subsequent Government and costs escalated and are escalating daily. The Government seems to believe that once the building is in place nothing else needs to be done, that there is no need for staff. A state-of-the-art operating theatre is unused. Orthopaedic facilities paid for by the State cannot be provided. Naas hospital is underutilised — 75% of the development plan for Naas hospital has been agreed but the hospital is running at only about 10% efficiency simply because of lack of direction, lack of resources and lack of intent on the part of the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">Let me turn to Peamount Hospital. Some bureaucrat somewhere decided to phase the respiratory and TB section of the hospital. That decision was made by administrators, not clinicians. That decision was wrong. This was subsequently proved when a patient was referred to the hospital from the Mater Hospital to be turned away by administrators. This has happened in other parts of the country as well. It is a disgrace that decisions are being made purely on administrative grounds. It is a dangerous precedent and should not be allowed to happen. The Minister should address the issue and ensure that the respiratory and TB section of Peamount Hospital continues in existence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">There was massive investment by the State in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. It was much needed and was supported by everybody. However, the back-up and ancillary services were not provided. It is a sad day for health services. It seems administrators now run the service and clinicians have a secondary role. They are required only when there is an emergency or a disaster. We are on a dangerous road and there will be serious consequences if something goes wrong. There have been a number of instances in hospitals in the Minister's constituency already and I do not want to see these repeated all over the country. However, unless a decision is taken to ensure that the three hospitals in question are given a firm footing on which to operate and a clear vision for their operation in the future, the service will collapse.</p>

Phase 3A, which includes accommodation and enabling works for future phases 3B and 3C, commenced on site in April 2002. All the departments constructed in phases 2 and 3A are now in operation, and it is a mistake to send out a message that units are built but not in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">Additional revenue and staffing are required to fully commission this development and these are the subject of ongoing discussion between the authority and the Department. If Deputy Durkan can suggest any other mechanism for arriving at a satisfactory conclusion that ensures value for money, appropriate placement of skilled personnel and so on without negotiation, he should tell us about it. I am sure he appreciates that negotiation is necessary and that sometimes that is difficult. I have been involved in negotiations regarding a community nursing unit in the Deputy's catchment area. There has been a huge amount of discussion on it and I cannot understand why progress has not been made.</p>

            <p eId="para_1837">I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 to 17, inclusive, 19 and 20 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">There are no proposals to decentralise my Department or any of the agencies or bodies under its aegis. Since 12 May this year, all staff wishing to decentralise must use the central application facility, CAF, regardless as to whether their name is already on any other existing transfer list, departmental or external.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">The CAF will remain open throughout the duration of the decentralisation programme. Those who apply prior to 7 September 2004 will be given priority in the case of locations that are over-subscribed. Information gathered through the CAF will be analysed by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission, which will inform Departments of the numbers of their staff applying for transfer to other organisations. Once I have this information, I will be in a position to respond to requests for information on the numbers of officials from my Department who have applied to relocate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">The report of the decentralisation implementation group, chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn — March 2004 — recommends that a system similar to CAF be developed to facilitate the reassignment of staff remaining in Dublin to other organisations. As information becomes available from the CAF, it will be possible to identify vacancies which will arise in organisations remaining in Dublin, as a result of individuals from those organisations applying for decentralised posts. The Dublin CAF will allow staff being reassigned within Dublin to apply for these vacancies. The modalities of this will be discussed between public service management and staff interests.</p>

In all, this and the previous Government have brought forward 10 referenda. The Government will avail of appropriate opportunities to take forward further recommendations of the all-party committee. The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question. The all-party committee published its ninth progress report on private property on 7 April 2004. All relevant Departments are considering its recommendations, with a view to further consideration by Government in due course. There are no plans at present to hold any referenda during the term of the current Dáil but this matter will be kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1932">I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">Agreement was reached on the terms of the core pay element of the review on Friday, 18 June, while the text recording agreement on a number of workplace related issues was finalised early in the following week. The agreement provides for a general round of pay increases in the private sector, totalling 5.5%, over 18 months with an additional half per cent increase for workers earning less than €9 per hour or €351 per week. The same increases will apply to the public service commencing on 1 June 2005. There is also a commitment to review the national minimum wage and provision for an increase in the weekly ceiling for the calculation of redundancy payments of nearly €100 to €600 with effect from 1 January 2005. At all times during the negotiation process, I remained in contact with my officials and was available, as required, for discussions with the social partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">Among the workplace related elements covered in the agreement are: an increase in maternity benefit from its current level of 70% of earnings to 80%, over the lifetime of the agreement; co-operation between the parties to the agreement, to address concerns relating to pensions provision, in particular, the need to increase the take-up of pensions across the economy; a recognition of the importance of a balanced approach to public procurement, based on clear and consistent guidelines; the principles governing our approach to policy in relation to public enterprise; the further development of partnership and learning in the workplace; recognition of the objectives of the Lisbon strategy; a continuing focus on inflation and excessive prices; ongoing consultation on the development of workplace legislation and codes; the appointment of four additional labour inspectors; and policies on the training and employment of people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">This agreement represents a fair deal for all concerned and I am hopeful that it will be ratified by the parties' respective memberships. If it is ratified, the agreement will serve to underpin our model of social cohesion, facilitate economic growth and maintain the industrial relations stability of recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">In reaching this agreement on pay and related matters, both the employer bodies and the trade unions had to overcome the difficulty of reconciling the needs of their members with the needs of our society and an uncertain economy. Such a task is only possible through a willingness on all sides to compromise in search of an agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1937">I believe that the parties have demonstrated this willingness and struck the right balance with regard to our national prosperity. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the positive contributions made by those on all sides who worked tirelessly to bring this agreement about. I would also like to take this opportunity to emphasise, with my colleagues, the Government's continued commitment to pursuing our nation's well-being and prosperity, through the process of social dialogue and I look forward to this ongoing dialogue on items of mutual interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1938">This completed review of pay and related matters in part two of Sustaining Progress complements the mid-term assessment of the ten special initiatives contained in part one, which is due to be addressed at the next quarterly plenary meeting with the social partners on 13 July 2004. As has been the case in previous years, it is my intention to attend that meeting along with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">Formal meetings such as these complement the meetings which I hold with representatives of the social partners on a regular basis. I will continue to meet with the social partners regularly, and as required, over the remainder of the lifetime of Sustaining Progress.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1956">I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 53, 74, 95, 104, 106, 128, 129, 132, 264, 269, 270, 271 and 272 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">The work which has been done by my Department's advisers in co-operation with Aer Rianta management and their advisers has underscored the fact that there are some major challenges facing the State airports and these challenges need to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">In the context of the proposed amending legislation to give effect to the restructuring of Aer Rianta currently before the Dáil, I have had numerous Government discussions informing my Cabinet colleagues on the background issues relating to the restructuring as well as the broad financial projections for each of the airports which were compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I have in the last week received a ten year business plan prepared by Aer Rianta. While there are some differences between the plan and the PricewaterhouseCoopers projections the broad thrust is consistent and it confirms that there are significant pre-existing financial challenges facing the State airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">My view is that the restructuring offers the best means of addressing these challenges. Under the State Airports Bill, it will be a matter for the new authorities, when established, to prepare and submit for approval detailed business plans for approval by myself and the Minister for Finance. These plans will be a basis for assessing the operational and financial readiness of each airport before any transfer of assets. Issues relating to Aer Rianta's main subsidiaries such as Great Southern Hotels group will be carefully considered in the course of the restructuring process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">The restructuring is designed to strengthen and expand each of three airports and to give both Shannon and Cork a fresh start. Through more focused commercial operation, all three airports can perform better and each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional and national economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry. It is general policy that the three State airports should be in a position to provide cost competitive and appropriate infrastructure and to operate on a sustainable commercial basis in meeting the current and future needs of users.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">I have already announced the board-designate for the Dublin Airport Authority which brings together people of the highest calibre who, in combination, possess considerable international and national aviation expertise and proven financial and business acumen. The Dublin Airport Authority will include worker directors and as such will represent all employees, including those at Cork and Shannon airports in advance of asset and staff transfers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">In the case of Dublin Airport, passenger traffic is forecast to grow to 30 million passengers per annum by around 2020. The Dublin Airport Authority must ensure the provision of adequate and cost effective infrastructure capacity to cater for this growth and make the appropriate case to the independent aviation regulator for the financing of this investment in the context of the next determination of airport charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">Shannon Development is the State agency charged with regional and economic development in the mid-west region. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been in discussions with the chairman and board members of Shannon Development to explore how best Shannon Development and the proposed Shannon Airport Authority can contribute to furthering the interests of the mid-west region. One of the options under consideration is the transfer of the assets of the Shannon Free Zone to the new airport authority. I understand that other options have emerged in the course of the Tánaiste's discussions with the board and that these are also being considered. Accordingly, a final decision on the most appropriate option has not been made as yet. In reaching a decision on this issue, it is the intention to put in place the most sensible and efficient structures and to manage the region's most valuable and strategic assets so as to optimise their benefits to the entire region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">As regards the naming of the new airport authorities, the State Airports Bill names the airport authorities in Irish and English and there is no intention to give the English titles undue priority over the Irish. In practical terms, it is reasonable to expect that the new airport authorities will market themselves internationally using the English title. As I indicated in the Dáil yesterday evening on Report Stage of the State Airports Bill 2004, I will ask the new boards to adopt a bilingual policy when using their respective titles particularly in the vicinity of each airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">The assets of Aer Rianta comprise the three State airports and its subsidiaries such as Great Southern Hotels and Aer Rianta International. At end 2003, the Aer Rianta annual accounts indicate that the net book value of Aer Rianta's tangible fixed assets amounted to €706.9 million and the value of financial fixed assets was €175.9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">As regards the future operation of the State and regional airports, it is the policy of the Government to encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive air services to and from Ireland. The central tenet of this policy is the belief that a strong, competitive and efficient network of air links are vitally important for developing our trade and tourism sectors, particularly having regard to our island status and peripheral location.</p>

            <p eId="para_1970">The programme for Government contains a commitment relating to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps. As I have already indicated in this House, I support the implementation of this proposal through the formation of a corps that will be separately identifiable and visible. A consultation process involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána in relation to the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps is being progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">Discussions to date have included the question of the relationship that a dedicated traffic corps will have with the gardaí and in particular whether it will be under the overall control of the commissioner. This issue is central to the development of this proposal. The establishment of a dedicated traffic corps which is independent of the gardaí, would require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish powers and functions of the corps and its accountability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">In addition, the establishment of a corps that is wholly independent of the gardaí would face formidable hurdles. The powers available to members of such an independent force would need very careful consideration and there is the overriding issue of the capacity of such individuals to engage in more general police work. The need for consideration of this issue has also been central to the discussions in relation to this proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">A working group has been established to urgently consider the options available in terms of progressing this proposal. This group comprises representatives from the Department of Transport, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Office of the Director of Traffic. I will be chairing a meeting of this group shortly.</p>

A quotation has been received from the contractors and is currently under consideration with a view to making a final decision as soon as possible. I will bring this matter to a conclusion by the end of this month and place the relevant documentation in the public arena.

            <p eId="para_1985">I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 118, 122, and 124 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1986">The Dublin Port tunnel, which I understand from the NRA and Dublin City Council is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005, will significantly improve access to Dublin Port in addition to providing relief to the city centre, environmental and safety benefits and relief from congestion for freight distributors and other port-related traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">A key mechanism to ensure that the tunnel meets its primary objective of providing easy access to Dublin Port for HGV traffic will be the implementation of a differentiated tolling system applicable to private cars. This tolling regime, under which HGVs will not be liable for tolls, and implementation of a HGV management strategy was always envisaged as part of the overall transport strategy underpinning the construction of the port tunnel in order to ensure that port freight traffic utilises the tunnel to the maximum extent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">Traffic management, including HGV traffic management, in the city centre and in the vicinity of the port is a matter primarily for Dublin City Council. I understand that Dublin City Council propose to address this in a HGV management plan currently being prepared, which will also address non-port related HGV traffic movements. Currently, all truck journeys in and out of Dublin Port pass through the city centre streets and adjacent residential areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">I understand from Dublin City Council that this plan will have three objectives: to ensure the optimal use by HGVs of the port tunnel; to minimise adverse effects of remaining HGV movements in the city; and to manage the movement of vehicles not within permitted dimensions, for example, through permit systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">Dublin City Council has published a report on HGV management as a basis for a widespread public consultation exercise. The public consultation period is now concluded and the responses received are being evaluated within Dublin City Council. I am informed by Dublin City Council that the HGV management plan, revised to take account of the submissions received, will be published in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1991">In addition, a regional freight of goods distribution study, commissioned by the DTO to determine the origin and destination patterns of HGVs in the greater Dublin area and to forecast future demand, is due to be completed shortly. I understand that it will identify obstacles to general goods distribution and for freight trips to and from Dublin Port, Dún Laoghaire Port and Dublin Airport. It will also review the scope for improved goods distribution strategies. I have not been directly involved in discussions with Dublin Port regarding improved access to the port.</p>

            <p eId="para_1995">The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has statutory responsibility for the implementation of an integrated ticketing system, based on smartcard technologies, for initial deployment in the Dublin area. The contactless smartcard-based integrated ticketing system will enable a passenger to use a single ticket on one or more public transport services, by road and/or by rail, irrespective of the transport operator involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">The RPA has set a target date of end 2005 for the launch of the full smartcard-based integrated ticketing system in Dublin. It is currently engaged in an open and competitive procurement process with a view to selecting a supplier and operator of the fully integrated ticketing system. The RPA continues to examine options to expedite the delivery of integrated ticketing with a view to bringing forward the proposed launch date. A first step was the launch in April of this year, in conjunction with the RPA, of a smartcard ticketing system by a private operator, Morton's, on its services. Another important step will be the launch later this year of smartcards on Luas services, followed by Dublin Bus in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1997">In the meantime, integrated tickets, based on magnet strip technology, are available for travel on Dublin Bus and Irish Rail services, and I understand that the RPA has concluded a similar arrangement with Dublin Bus in respect of Luas services. The allocation for integrated ticketing in the 2004 Estimates for my Department is €9.5 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_2000">I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 138 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">The content of the driving test is set out in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU directives. As in other EU countries, there are variations in the pass rate among test centres. The pass rate may be influenced by a number of factors, including the number of lessons taken by the candidate, the standard of instruction available and demographic factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2002">In relation to consistency in the standard of the driving test, my Department undertook a comprehensive training programme for all driver testers in 2002 covering procedures for carrying out the test, guidelines to assess faults and training to enhance customer service in the delivery of the driving test. The work of each individual tester is monitored on an ongoing basis by his or her supervisor and remedial action is taken where this is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2003">Following the Comptroller and Auditor General's report a review of the driver testing service was carried out by consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers whose recommendation was that a separate public sector agency be established to deliver the driver testing service. Such an agency would have more flexibility to respond to variations in demand. The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill which will establish such an agency was published on 6 July 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">The pass rate for 2003 for each driving test centre is set out in the following table.</p>

            <p eId="para_2116">I am informed by the NRA that since the 1999-2000 period, it has strengthened its cost estimation, control and procurement procedures so as to have more accurate cost estimates from the earliest stages of a project and to ensure greater certainty of outturn costs between tender stage and completion date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2117">Measures taken include: greater use of design and build lump sum fixed price contracts offering cost efficiencies, greater certainty of outturn costs and reduced scope for claims; standardisation of economic designs for high cost items such as bridges and other structures; securing greater involvement by foreign contractors; buyout of price variation clause and risk — traditional procurement — where this gives good value; and further attention to improving quality of site investigations and acceptance of such investigations by contractors as agreed basis for pricing. These measures are bearing fruit in more accurate initial estimates and less divergence between final outturn costs and costs at tender stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_2123">By letter dated 24 February 2004 the advisory council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation provided advice to me on a number of matters relevant to small public service vehicles and their drivers. The council recommended the removal of the exemption on the wearing of seat belts by the drivers of small public service vehicles, the early commencement of section 37 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 which requires small public service vehicle and driving licence holders and applicants to hold a current tax clearance certificate, and the introduction of a new identification badge for all drivers of small public service vehicles to replace the existing metal badge. I advised the council on 31 March 2004 that I had accepted its advice on these matters and had asked my Department to proceed with the consideration of the proposals in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">On 22 May 2004, I made regulations to remove, with effect from 1 July 2004, the exemption whereby the driver of a taxi, hackney or limousine is not required to wear a seat belt while driving such a vehicle. I also signed an order on 1 June 2004 to commence section 37(1) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 with effect from 2 August 2004. From that date a taxi, wheelchair accessible taxi, hackney or limousine licence will not be granted or renewed unless the applicant produces to the licensing authority, that is, the local authority or the gardaí as appropriate, a tax clearance certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners under section 1095 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">The proposals in relation to driver identification have been the subject of correspondence with the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The question of colour coding according to whether a taxi, hackney or limousine service is being provided, however, raises some wider issues as the present driver licensing system does not differentiate between drivers of different vehicle categories. I have suggested to the council that this aspect merits further consideration by it and, ultimately, by the Commission for Taxi Regulation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2127">I am anxious to ensure that as many practical measures as possible are taken to improve the movement of buses on the road network and thereby reduce journey times and congestion. In that regard, my Department is engaged in discussions with Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus, Dublin Transportation Office, the quality bus network project office and the National Roads Authority regarding the use of the hard shoulder on roads for bus lanes, particularly in and around the Dublin area. This will include the introduction of bus lanes on motorways in that area. Necessary changes to traffic signs and parking regulations to support this initiative are being prepared at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">Separately, the application of a separate speed limit to vehicles using a reserved hard shoulder may be required in certain circumstances and this is not currently provided for in primary legislation. To deal with this, the Road Traffic Bill 2004, published on 11 June, proposes to provide a legal basis for the introduction of a separate special speed limit on a hard shoulder <i>in lieu</i> of the speed limit that normally applies to that road. The Bill is currently awaiting a timetable for its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Pending the enactment of the necessary legislation, the NRA and the quality bus network project office are identifying locations and making the necessary preparations at those locations where buses will be permitted to use the hard shoulder. Details will be announced in due course.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2130">I have previously indicated to the House that last March I advised my Cabinet colleagues of the state of my deliberations concerning the future of Aer Lingus. I also advised that I would be reverting to Government on specific options for the company in the near future. Those deliberations involved consideration of the reports from the chairman of Aer Lingus and an independent corporate finance consultant whom I commissioned to look at the sale options for the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_2131">However, the House will be aware of recent developments concerning a request from Aer Lingus senior management for permission to develop an investment proposal for the Company. In response to that request, my Department immediately requested that no further activity take place in relation to any proposal until the matter had been considered from a corporate governance, process and policy perspective. Appropriate legal and financial advice was then sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_2132">My primary concern since then has been to protect the shareholders' interest and to guard against conflicts of interest. In that context, on 3 July last, I announced the appointment of Mr. John Sharman, an existing director, as acting chairman pending the appointment of a replacement for the previous chairman. The acting chairman and company secretary have since sought legal advice on the appropriateness of the current corporate governance arrangements and are acting on that advice. I have also been advised that a board meeting has been arranged for Thursday, 8 July 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">The acting chairman and board are, of course, charged with ensuring the ongoing orderly management of the business, particularly in relation to the finalising of the business plan which is critical to the successful implementation of the strategy adopted for the airline. My Department and the Department of Finance, which met the chairman, company secretary and their legal advisors on 5 July 2004, are liaising closely with the chairman so as to ensure that the governance arrangements put in place by the board are robust.</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">The Government considered the matter at its meeting yesterday and decided: to establish a Cabinet sub-committee, consisting of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers for Finance, Transport and Arts, Sport and Tourism, to examine all of the issues involved and report back to the Government as soon as possible; to advise senior management in Aer Lingus that in the interim there was to be no further activity as regards the request for consent to develop a proposal until such time as the Government has time to consider the matter in detail; and the Government will respond in due course to the request in the context of the Government's ongoing consideration of the ownership issue which has been underway for several months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2135">The Government will also consider the request in the context of the need for openness and transparency, the avoidance of conflicts of interest, reduction in risk, maximisation of value and consultation with stakeholders. I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the Government's consideration in this matter. However, I assure the Deputy that if the Government decides to embark on a sale of all or part of Aer Lingus, I will be consulting with the appropriate interests, including unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2136">In addition, in such an eventuality, I will set out for the House, in accordance with the provisions of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, the general principles of the proposed sale as well as the basis for the Government's decision and the arguments for and against such a sale. I will also set out how the Government proposes to deal with important strategic issues such as slots at Heathrow.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">There is no doubt that under the current management, the airline has made enormous progress in the past two years. However, that work must continue in order to ensure the ongoing viability of the company. In that context, it is vital that the new business plan is finalised in the near future and considered by the Aer Lingus board. I, therefore, do not wish to speculate on its contents at this stage. I want to make it clear, however, that the plan is essential, irrespective of any decision on ownership, as the challenging and difficult external environment facing the airline remains the same.</p>

            <p eId="para_2143">I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 85 and 255 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">The average waiting times and numbers waiting for a driving test as at 5 July 2004 are set out in the table below. Driver testers continue to deliver additional tests by working overtime on Saturdays and at lunchtime. I have also asked my officials to explore the possibility of recruiting additional testers. Contracts have been extended for three retired driver testers and my Department is in the process of renewing contracts with another four retired testers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">Following a comprehensive review of the driver testing service, the Government approved the establishment of a driver testing and standards authority to deliver the driver testing service in accordance with pre-set performance standards. The proposed authority will also promote improved driving standards generally. The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004, which will provide the statutory basis for the new authority, was published on 6 July 2004.</p>

The independent report evaluates the first three years of the safety camera scheme and also shows that there was a 33% fall in injury accidents — 4,030 fewer per year; a 35% reduction in pedestrians killed or seriously injured; average speeds at new sites fell by around 7% or 2.4 mph and the number of vehicles speeding at new camera sites dropped by 71%. Other notable findings of the report state that some 79% of people asked support the use of cameras to reduce casualties and the benefit to society through casualties saved is about £221 million sterling per year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2318">The road safety strategy 1998-2002 set a target of a 20% reduction in both road deaths and serious injuries by the end of 2002 based on 1997 figures. This target was achieved in the case of road deaths and significantly surpassed in the case of serious injuries. While the number of road deaths continued to decrease in 2003, figures relating to serious injuries are not yet available for that year. In the 20 month period since penalty points have been in operation, the number of road deaths is 108 fewer than the number of deaths during the preceding 20 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2319">At a recent road safety conference organised by the National Safety Council, a speaker representing the National Roads Authority stated that road collisions are rare and that one in six drivers can expect to be involved in an injury accident in their life. This means that almost 85% of drivers can expect never to be involved in a collision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2320">The number of road deaths at 5 July 2004 is 19 higher than for the same period last year, representing a 10% increase on the number of road deaths this time last year. While the increase in road deaths so far this year is a cause of immediate concern, it should be looked at against the background of the significant progress achieved, especially over recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">The programme for Government states that a three year road safety strategy will be developed and will target speeding, drink-driving, seat-belt wearing and pedestrian safety in order to reduce deaths and injuries. At my request, the high level group on road safety has prepared a draft new strategy for the period 2004-06 and following approval from Government to publish the strategy, arrangements have been put in place to provide for printing and publishing of the document, including its translation into Irish. I hope to publish the new strategy shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">The preparation of the new strategy has taken account of the achievements in meeting the targets set out in the road to safety strategy 1998-2002, a comprehensive review of that strategy and further positive trends established in 2003, and the evolving developments in relation to the EU third road safety action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">The strategy, which includes a report on progress achieved during the term of the previous strategy, will outline a range of issues that it is intended will be pursued over the period in question. In overall terms, measures will focus on the areas of education, enforcement, engineering and legislation and will target the key areas of speeding, driving while intoxicated and seat-belt wearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">The difficult start to 2004 will be given particular consideration by the high level group to ensure that the measures recommended in the new strategy will be implemented as quickly as possible. In addition, the group will monitor the ongoing effects of those measures and recommend adjustment to the focus of the strategy as necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_2331">Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding, seat belt wearing and insurance offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the gardaí in the case of speeding and seat belt wearing offences in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">Penalty points for careless driving were introduced with effect from 4 June 2004. This measure should have a further positive influence on the driving behaviour of those who have little regard for their own safety and the safety of other road users.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">The full application of the penalty points system will be achieved when the relevant IT systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are completed. I am assured by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that the systems in question will be operational by the end of this year. The question of reviewing the system will be considered against the background of its full operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">It is now one year and eight months since penalty points were first introduced. At 30 June 2004, more than 153,000 drivers had received penalty points since the introduction of the system in October 2002, including three drivers who have reached the 12 point threshold which leads to automatic disqualification.</p>

            <p eId="para_2344">I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 84 and 140 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">The programme for Government provides for the continued support of our six regional airports in Kerry, Waterford, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Donegal. My Department provides a range of financial mechanisms in support of this objective, but it is important to note that the regional airports are not in receipt of state subsidies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">With regard to capital funding, grant-aid of approximately €9 million has already been paid to the regional airports under first round allocations of the regional airports measure of the NDP. The primary objective of this measure is to facilitate continued safe and viable operations at the regional airports. A further round of projects will be considered for funding under the measure later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">My Department also administers a grant scheme to assist the regional airports with marketing, safety and security related current expenditure. The total amount provisionally allocated in the Estimates for 2004 is €2.24 million and the individual amounts for each airport will be determined shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">My Department provides subvention to contracted regional air carriers for the operation of essential air services under the public service obligation, PSO, regime. EU Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2408/92 allows member states to establish a PSO in respect of scheduled air services to an airport serving a peripheral or development region where such air services are considered essential for the economic development of the regions concerned and where air carriers are not prepared to provide such air services on a commercial basis. In accordance with this EU regulation, the Government has established PSOs on routes linking Dublin Airport with the airports in Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo, Donegal and Derry.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">The total cost of air service subvention to PSO carriers amounts to over €20 million per annum. The subvention level per trip per passenger for the past five years is as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_2405">I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 282, 283, 284, 285 and 286 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">The power to determine the locations for the provision of bus stops is vested in the Garda Commissioner under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. Under that section, the commissioner may issue a direction to a bus operator identifying the specific location of bus stops in respect of any bus route. I understand that the gardaí engage in a consultation process with both the local authority and the bus service provider before issuing a direction under section 85. The review of the location of bus stops following the Dublin Bus tragedy is ongoing by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann and any concerns in that regard are raised with the local authorities and Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">In regard to the safety of bus services, all bus operators are required to demonstrate to my Department that all their vehicles are taxed, insured, roadworthy and approved as public service vehicles. Safety on our railway systems is the legal responsibility of the operator. Iarnród Éireann has responsibility for safety on the heavy rail network while Connex Ireland Limited has responsibility for the Sandyford Luas line. The Railway Procurement Agency has responsibility for safety on the Tallaght Luas line while construction work continues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2408">Iarnród Éireann has assured me that all railway operations on its network operate to strict standards, to ensure the highest level of safety for its customers and staff. The Sandyford Luas line is being managed in accordance with the safety case approved by the interim railway safety commission. The same safety case will apply in respect of the Tallaght line once passenger operations commence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">In addition, the Railway Safety Bill, when enacted, will provide an up to date framework within which railway undertakings must demonstrate safety adequacy and provides for the establishment of a railway safety commission, which will have the necessary powers to monitor and enforce compliance. The Bill also places duties on railway undertakings, their staff and third parties and requires railway undertakings to put in place formal safety management systems and to submit a safety case to the commission for approval.</p>

          <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_884">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2414">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 96, 136 and 142 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">I set out my policy proposals for public transport reform in statements to the Public Transport Partnership Forum in November 2002 and the Oireachtas Committee on Transport in June 2003. My objectives in proposing reform of the 70 year old legislation which regulates the public transport sector are: to use competition in the provision of bus services to stimulate better performance, improved efficiency and cost effectiveness; to ensure that the taxpayer and the public transport user get better value for money; and to show clearly how funding for public transport is being spent to deliver service, and to establish a clear link between payments and performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2416">The principal elements of my proposals are: the establishment of an independent procurement and regulatory authority for transport, on a national basis; and the introduction of controlled competition into the bus market in the Dublin area in the form of franchising as the primary means of procuring bus services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2417">I am firmly of the view that creating genuine opportunities for other bus companies to enter the bus market in Dublin is in the best interests of both the taxpayer and the customers of public transport. I am also firmly of the view that these opportunities can be created without adversely impacting on the pay and conditions of existing Dublin Bus employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">Officials of my Department have held a number of meetings with the CIE unions since February this year. On 12 May, my Department put detailed proposals on reform of the bus market in Dublin to the CIE unions. On 18 May, the CIE unions presented a substantive response paper through the independent chair. This paper included proposals which would have significant implications for the industrial relations structure of the bus industry, and which in turn would have potentially significant ramifications for the wider economy and the general approach to industrial relations in this country. When the discussions resumed on 8 June, my officials gave an initial response to the union paper but advised the unions that, given the implications of these proposals, there was a need for detailed consultations with other Departments and for the issue to be discussed at Cabinet. Unfortunately, despite this need to consider the proposals more fully, the NBRU decided to ballot on industrial action.</p>
            <p eId="para_2419">I regret the recent announcement by the NBRU that it plans to go ahead with industrial action which will seriously inconvenience the travelling public, have negative impacts on business and tourism and damage the reputation of public transport as a viable alternative to private car commuting. There is no need for this industrial action. The talks, under the skilled chairmanship of Kevin Foley, have been making progress. There has been real engagement in identifying and solving the core issues. I remain personally committed to the current talks process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2420">As regards the bus licensing issue, my Department issued two licences in early June to enable the provision of morning and evening services for workers in the Citywest Business Park. In processing the licence applications, my Department followed its normal procedure which included an assessment of the public interest as narrowly defined by the Road Transport Act 1932. During the course of its assessment, my Department was advised by Citywest that Dublin Bus had first been requested to provide services into the business campus, but had expressed no interest in doing so. The background to this licensing decision has been fully explained to the trade unions. I have repeatedly made it clear that the Road Transport Act 1932 no longer provides a satisfactory basis for regulating the bus market and that I plan to replace it as part of my regulatory reform programme. The sooner we find a basis in the talks process for moving forward in the reform programme, the sooner the 1932 Act will be replaced.</p>

            <p eId="para_2426">The working group will examine and evaluate all aspects of the western rail corridor proposal, including the costs and benefits of the proposal; the travel demand that gives rise to the proposal; how such a project might be funded, and where the proposal stands in the context of the findings of the national spatial strategy, the strategic rail review, the regional planning guidelines, relevant county and city development and land use plans, the submissions put forward in relation to the proposal and the current and proposed road investment programmes in the vicinity of the line.</p>
            <p eId="para_2427">In my address to the group in its inaugural meeting, I specifically made the point that, while I would wish it to conclude its deliberations as quickly as possible, I was not going to put a time limit on how long this might be.

            <p eId="para_2433">A design manual for cycle facilities entitled, Provision of Cycle Facilities — National Manual for Urban Areas, was published in March 1998 by the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, in association with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The manual comprises a comprehensive set of guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities and is intended to be of assistance to local authorities in ensuring that such facilities are provided to a uniform and high standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2434">The safety of cyclists was one of the principle considerations behind the development of the cycle facilities design manual and the regulations covering the use of such facilities. To this end, international practice as applied in the Netherlands and the UK was brought to bear on these developments. This 1998 manual is currently being reviewed by the DTO and the review is expected to be finalised later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2435">The National Safety Council is mandated with responsibility for road safety advertising and education.

            <p eId="para_2439">As I have not seen the Dublin Bus report and as the full details of the arrangements for the introduction of franchising in Dublin have not yet been published, I do not know the basis for the figures quoted by the Deputy but I believe that they are greatly inflated. It remains my intention to proceed with legislation on public transport reform in 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_2443">I am aware that consultants have estimated the cost of congestion to Dublin Bus as €49 million per annum. The plans to tackle congestion in Dublin are being dealt with at two levels: increasing the supply of public transport, strategic road construction and traffic management, and reducing the growth in travel through complementary land use and other policies which is designed to encourage a transfer of journeys, especially at peak periods, from private car to sustainable modes of transport such as public transport, cycling and walking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2444">Significant progress has been made in recent years in this regard. There have been major increases in the capacity of the public transport system: the capacity of the DART system has been increased by over 50% since 2000 and further increases are being implemented which will mean that by the end of next year, the capacity of the DART will have increased by over 100% since 2000; 80 new diesel railcars were introduced earlier this year on suburban commuter services and a further 36 are to be delivered next year; the capacity of Dublin Bus has been increased with over 25% increase in capacity at peak times; Bus Éireann has increased its services by around 40% from commuter towns, such as Drogheda Navan and Naas, to the city centre; to facilitate buses, my Department is funding a major programme to expand the quality bus network and improve traffic management at a cost of €40 million per annum; the Luas is now in operation on the Sandyford line and services will commence on the Tallaght line at the end of August; and major road improvements are also under way in the greater Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2445">In addition, the Dublin Transportation Office is also working closely with the planning authorities to influence land use policies in the greater Dublin area to favour more sustainable forms of transport at the planning stage. This is being achieved through integrated land use and transportation plans at local level and commenting on major planning applications and appeals which are of strategic transport importance. There is expected to be a sustained increase in the population of the greater Dublin area over the coming years and increasing levels of car ownership. Good progress has been made to date in that public transport-walking-cycling has increased its share of all journeys in the city centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_2446">I am confident that measures, such as those I have mentioned, together with the opening of the port tunnel and the completion of the M50 in 2005, will go a long way towards addressing Dublin's congestion problems.</p>

            <p eId="para_2448">The taxi hardship panel was an independent three person panel established in February 2002 to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime, including an estimate of the numbers of individual licence holders involved, the likely financial implications and the recommended criteria for assessment of extreme personal financial hardship under any subsequent proposed response by Government. Some 2,000 submissions were received by the panel and the panel also met taxi representative groups and some individuals who made submissions before finalising its report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2449">The report of the panel recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. The payments range from €3,000 to €15,000 depending on the category of hardship involved. The Government approved the implementation on a phased basis of these recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2450">Area Development Management Limited, ADM, has been engaged to administer the taxi hardship payments scheme which is implementing the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report in accordance with the relevant Government decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2451">The taxi hardship payments scheme was formally launched in November 2003 with application forms being issued to all persons who made submissions to the taxi hardship panel. In addition, newspaper advertisements were placed in the national newspapers on 6 November 2003 and 27 February 2004 inviting applications under the scheme from individual taxi licence holders at 21 November 2000 who could demonstrate that they have suffered extreme personal financial hardship following loss of income arising from the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime, who fall into one of the six categories in which payment was recommended by the taxi hardship panel report, and who are tax compliant. The closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme was 30 April 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2452">A total of 1,860 applications have been received by ADM under the scheme with a significant number, approximately 500, being received in the week immediately prior to the closing date. Hardship payments totalling €9,516,000 have been made to 791 qualifying persons under the scheme to date. To date, 19 applicants have not qualified for a hardship payment. The remaining applications are under consideration. The time taken to process applications and to make payments depends on the completeness of the information and supporting documentation in each individual application.</p>

            <p eId="para_2457">As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 188 of 16 June 2004, the issuing of driving licences is a matter for each licensing authority in accordance with the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts and regulations made thereunder. Records of licences issued are held on the national driver file which is a central record held by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Computer databases and records of licences issued were held by each licensing authority until they were transferred to the National Driver File two years ago. It remains the responsibility of the licensing authorities to ensure that the licence record is updated when new licences are issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">A person who has lost a driving licence may apply for a duplicate licence by completing statutory form D 800 which is available at licensing authorities. Where the licensing authority are satisfied that the driving licence has been lost, destroyed or mutilated they may, on payment of a fee of €5 issue a duplicate licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2459">A licensing authority may only issue a driving licence if it receives, <i> inter alia</i>, a certificate of competency from an individual or proof that that individual was already entitled to a driving licence. In the absence of such documentation, the law precludes the licensing authority from issuing a driving licence or a duplicate driving licence. Where a licensing authority has no record of a person having held a licence, a person may submit to the licensing authority, in support of their application for a further licence, any evidence they might have that they held a driving licence and the vehicle categories in respect of which they held the licence.</p>

            <p eId="para_2461">Under the Road Traffic Acts, a default maximum speed limit of 30 miles per hour applies to roads in urban areas, including Dublin city centre, unless the local authority intervenes by way of making speed limit by-laws to apply a special limit in lieu of this default built up area speed limit. Under the present speed limit structures the speed limit of 30 mph is the lowest maximum value that can be applied on a public road.</p>
            <p eId="para_2462">A broadly based working group established last year to review speed limit policies, against the backdrop of the adoption of metric values for speed limits, has presented a comprehensive report that incorporates a wide range of recommendations. The report is available on my Department's website and copies have been forwarded to the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_2463">The working group recommended that a default speed limit of 50 km/h should apply in built up areas — this value is very similar to the current default speed limit of 30 km/h in built up areas. In addition, a particular recommendation has been made in relation to the introduction of a special low speed limit of 30 kph for residential areas that meet certain criteria, in particular where appropriate traffic calming measures are provided. The working group envisaged that the application by local authorities of this special low speed limit would be subject to guidelines to be issued by my Department. I have given very careful consideration to the working group's recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2472">The National Roads Authority, NRA, has published the results of national speed surveys which have been carried out in 1997, 1999 and 2002. The most recent survey was carried out in 2003, the results of which have not yet been published. Preliminary indications are however that the proportion of cars exceeding the speed limit on urban arterial and residential roads fell sharply between summer 2002 and summer 2003. The fall in the percentage of free speeding cars exceeding the speed limit was most dramatic in urban residential areas. The percentage of cars violating posted 30 mph limits on these roads fell by 25% in 2003. These reductions coincide with the introduction of penalty points for speeding in October 2002. The free speeding — rural — survey also showed sizeable improvements in car speeding rates on dual carriageways and two lane national primary roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_2473">The figures to which the Deputy refers relate to the percentage of cars and articulate vehicles exceeding the 30 mph speed limit on entering a 30 mph zone. The significant improvements to which I have referred related to speeding rates within the 30 and 40 mph zones. Despite the improvements outlined in the report, the percentage of cars speeding in 30 and 40 mph zones, particularly when entering these zones, is a worrying trend and I will shortly be publishing a new three year road safety strategy which will include measures targeted at the key areas relating to road collisions, including speeding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2474">The effectiveness of the penalty points system can be judged primarily on the basis of the contribution it has made to road safety since its introduction. In the 20 months since October 2002, the number of deaths as a result of road collisions has fallen by 108 by comparison to the previous 20 month period. Penalty points now operate in respect of speeding, seat belt wearing, driving without insurance and careless driving. Since the introduction of the system over 153,000 drivers have incurred penalty points. In overall terms, the introduction of penalty points has had a very positive effect on road safety and I am confident that the full roll out of the system will further enhance that effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_2480">The Irish Aviation Authority has statutory responsibility for regulating the technical and safety aspects of civil aviation and for the provision of air traffic services. The authority's role as safety regulator includes the approval of all new air traffic control systems and equipment in line with international standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2481">I am advised by the authority that a new air traffic management system was installed at Dublin Airport as part of a national air traffic management upgrade programme. This was introduced into operational service, following extensive testing and evaluation, on 22 April 2004 and initially operated in dual operational mode, that is, with both new and old systems operating in parallel. This was in accordance with the transition plan to migrate from the old to the new system, which called for a gradual increase in the use of the new system, with the old system in standby mode.</p>
            <p eId="para_2482">The authority further advised that on 22 May, the new system was brought into operation in Dublin on a stand-alone basis with its predecessor held in hot standby mode. On 23 May, a software problem developed in one of the 24 main servers providing data to the system. This of itself would not have caused a major difficulty but as a precaution an operational decision was taken to revert to the old system while the server problem was being addressed, as was provided for in the transition plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2483">The problem was then identified and a solution found, tested, installed and validated. Operations using the new system recommenced on 26 May and have continued satisfactorily since that date. No other problems of operational significance have occurred. The authority has assured me of its confidence in the safety and reliability of the new air traffic control system.</p>

I await such a plan and, if approved, it would be followed by a formal application to me for a railway order that would trigger the statutory procedures, including a public inquiry, provided for in the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001. In the absence of a business plan it would be premature to comment on the costings of such an extension. It is also premature to speculate on a completion date for the extension.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">The Dublin Transportation Office strategy, A Platform for Change, provides for a Luas line to Lucan. The RPA, as part of its forward planning, has reviewed possible alignments, approaches to implementation and projected patronage.

I understand from the RPA that the planning of the line is not sufficiently advanced to provide either an estimate of cost or a timescale for implementation.</p>

It proposed the establishment of a new strategic land use and transportation planning authority for the greater Dublin area. Developments since have caused me to review its proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2505">Recently the regional authorities finalised regional planning guidelines under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000.

A package of further safety measures includes emergency telephones, lay-bys, pedestrian and vehicular cross passages, continuous CCTV coverage of the tunnel, a 24 hour manned control room, fire detection equipment and incident detection equipment. The ventilation system, along with the safety measures, represents a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safe passage of vehicles through the port tunnel. It is in line with the best international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">My Department appointed consultants to review the feasibility, safety implications and cost of raising the height of the Dublin Port tunnel. They were requested to review a range of options for increasing the operational height of the tunnel.

            <p eId="para_2513">Having reviewed the findings of the report further information was sought from the NRA pertaining to its conclusions in particular relation to the costs should the tunnel height be increased.

            <p eId="para_2525">The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the outturn costs of individual road projects, is a matter for the NRA and the local authorities concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">The national development plan mid-term target of 30% completion of the major inter-urban routes by the end of 2003 was largely met with 29% of the programme completed on schedule. Since 2000 a total of 41 projects or over 277 km were completed. Work is in progress on 18 projects or 199 km and another 12 projects or 88 km are at tender stage. The estimated cost of delivering the programme was €16.4 billion using prices from the end of 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">I understand from the NRA that the current position in relation to the upgrading of the five major inter-urban routes to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard is that the M1 is expected to be complete by the end of 2006. Work is under way on the following major projects: the N7 Monasterevin bypass, which is expected to be opened later this year; the N8 Cashel bypass; the N4-N6 Kilcock-Kinnegad; the N8 Fermoy bypass; and the Dundalk western bypass. Work is expected to start this year on the Dundalk to Newry road on the M1, the Waterford City bypass and the Naas Road widening. Completion of these projects will eliminate many of the major bottlenecks on these routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">In addition, it is expected that compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact statements for the remaining projects for these routes will either be approved by or be lodged with An Bord Pleanála by the end of 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">In order to provide greater certainty about resources that facilitate a more cost effective implementation of the programme I have secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance for the introduction of a multi-annual funding framework for national road investment. It provides for a total national road development investment of €8.2 billion, of which €6.9 billion is Exchequer funding and €1.3 billion will be invested by the private sector in public private partnerships, over the period 2004-2008. I have asked the NRA to submit a five year plan to ensure that the resources being made available under the capital envelope are utilised to best effect. The envelope will be underpinned by an agreement between my Department and the Department of Finance. It will incorporate provisions relating to, <i>inter alia</i>, the annual funding levels, contractual commitments and reporting and monitoring arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2537">The NDP provides for significant private sector investment in the national roads development programme. In line with this policy, a number of major road upgrade projects throughout the country are being implemented by the NRA by means of PPPs, with the private sector being remunerated, in part, by user tolls. This will ensure earlier delivery of vital national road infrastructure. Private sector innovation will be harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance through PPPs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2538">The NRA's current PPP programme comprises ten projects. In selecting them the authority had regard to a number of factors including the following: a geographical spread of tolls across the network; the extent of service improvement to be provided by the improved route; the availability of sufficiently high traffic volumes to ensure commercial viability; and the setting of tolls at an affordable and acceptable level in order to reduce diversion and gain public acceptance. It is clear that there is limited capacity, over and above the projects already identified by the NRA, across the national road network to support viable tolling arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2539">Nevertheless the increased cost of the national roads programme, combined with the demands of the other sectors that limit the capacity to allocate more Exchequer funding, require that all possibilities for generating additional funding to accelerate the implementation of the national roads programme be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2540">In this context and that of a broader review of the arrangements for the delivery of the programme, the NRA recently identified a number of options for the development of tolling policy to enable it to raise additional funding for the national roads programme. My Department is considering its proposals. Any decisions on the extension of tolling beyond the current PPP programme would be considered by the Government.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2562">I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 259, 273 and 274 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2563">Procurement arrangements, contracts and the delivery of capital infrastructure are primarily the responsibility of the State bodies under the aegis of my Department. They comply with the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, including conformity with the guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure in the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2564">Good progress was made in the implementation of the overall national roads upgrade programme provided for in the NDP. To date 41 projects, a total of 278 km, including 76 km of motorway and 62 km of dual carriageway standard, have been completed. In addition, work is under way on 18 projects totalling 199 km, including 175 km to motorway-dual carriageway standard and another 12 projects, or 88 km, are at tender stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2565">In relation to the five major inter-urban routes, the key NDP mid-term, end of 2003, target of 30% completion of the five MIUs was substantially met with 29% achieved and work under way on approximately another 12%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2566">Following publication of the NDP in 1999, at a time of high construction sector inflation due to constrained capacity in the construction industry, the cost of the national roads programme mandated in the NDP increased substantially from €6.96 million, early 1999 prices, to €15.8 billion, early 2002 prices. The increase was attributable to: exceptional items such as the additional land-archeological costs on the south eastern motorway and the Dublin Port tunnel. There were also add-ons such as a reduction in timescale, higher road standards, upgrading of routes such as the N9 — 31%; construction cost inflation and initial underestimation — 49%; and scheme refinement as design process proceeded — 18%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2567">Since 2001 construction cost inflation has moderated from an annual average of 12% to less than 5%. Given the lower level of construction inflation and improvements in cost estimation and control, it is likely that the overall cost of the NDP mandated programme will not have changed significantly from the 2002 figure of €15.8 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2568">In considering the national roads programme and its development and management in recent years, it is important to bear in mind the major expansion in the scale of the programme over the period since 2000. The level of activity on the programme was increased very significantly in this period. Initial costing of the programme of work proved difficult due to the limited information available from the smaller preceding programme and the preliminary scheme outlines available as a basis for costing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">The NRA made significant efforts to strengthen programming, project management systems and cost estimation and control. A number of independent evaluation reports, such as C.F. Fitzpatrick and Indecon, acknowledged that the national roads investment programme is, in general, well managed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">My Department continues to support the NRA in the strengthening of its cost estimation, control and procurement procedures. This is being done in order to have more accurate cost estimates from the earliest stages of a project and to ensure greater certainty of outturn costs between tender stage and completion date. The measures taken include: a greater use of design and build lump sum fixed price contracts offering cost efficiencies; greater certainty of outturn costs and reduced scope for claims; standardisation of economic designs for high cost items such as bridges and other structures; the buy out of price variation, clause and risk, or traditional procurement, where this gives good value; the further attention to improving the quality of site investigations; and the acceptance of such investigations by contractors as an agreed basis for pricing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2571">The mid-term evaluation of the economic and social infrastructure programme recognised that, as result of NDP investment since 2000, significant increases in public transport capacity were achieved in a number of areas, including the DART, suburban rail, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. The full impact of public transport investment will be evident over the next two years. There will be further additions to capacity with the coming into operation of the Luas lines, the upgrading of the DART system, the placing into service of additional rolling stock and the expansion of the quality bus corridor network in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">The NDP's public transport priority performed positively in terms of physical output, financial absorption and good management. As a result the Department of Finance and the European Commission have recommended that it be allocated a proportion of a performance reserve allocation from the EU Structural Funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">There have been increases in the cost of public transport projects since the NDP was published due to the cost of inflation. There have also been improvements in cost estimation, project management and monitoring and in general projects are being completed in line with tender prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2574">One of the objectives of the NDP in relation to mainline rail includes completion of the Railway Safety Programme 1999-2003 at a cost of €546 million using 1998 prices. Another objective was the reconstitution of the rail safety task force to prepare recommendations for a second five year safety programme before the end of 2003. Both objectives were met. Some individual infrastructural renewal targets were not achieved such as level crossings. However, other significant and essential renewal works, such as cuttings, embankment and coastal protection, not envisaged in the original safety programme were completed instead.</p>
            <p eId="para_2575">Approximately €571 million was invested under the safety programme during the course of the NDP. Over €660 million will be invested over the full five year programme. The task force completed its work and will shortly submit its recommendations to Government for a new safety programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2576">On 30 June the opening ceremony of the first Sandyford Luas line took place. Passenger services on the Tallaght line will commence at the end of August.</p>
            <p eId="para_2577">In 2000 the Government approved the capital cost of €466 million for the Luas project. It consisted of €265 million for the Sandyford line and €201 million for the Tallaght line. The sum was based on preliminary estimates, using 1999 prices, submitted by CIE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2578">In February 2001 the budget was revised and increased to €675 million. As much as €480 million was allocated for the Tallaght line and €295 million was allocated for the Sandyford line. There was also a risk provision of €89 million to take account of actual competitive tender prices received. The revised allocation reflected high inflation in the construction sector, higher than anticipated property acquisition costs and changes to the scope of the project mainly related to the provision for upgrading the Sandyford line to metro status.</p>
            <p eId="para_2579">In December 2002 the Government noted the increase in the budget to €691 million, composed of €501 million for the Tallaght line, €290 million for the Sandyford line and a risk provision of €84 million. The reasons for the increase of €16 million is accounted for by the higher than anticipated costs associated with the demolition of the Connolly ramp and increases in the costs of utilities and enabling works. The RPA has informed me that the project is within the €691 million budget and risk provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2580">Responsibility for the completion of projects within the targeted timescale rests with the regional airports.

            <p eId="para_2583">On 29 June, I received a report from Judge Barron on a number of events. These included Dublin bombings in the Film Centre cinema in November 1972, Eden Quay and Sackville Place in December 1972 and Sackville Place in January 1973. Appendices to this report, received from Judge Barron on 5 July, included the murder of Bríd Carr, the murders of Oliver Boyce and Bríd Porter, the bombings in Clones, Belturbet and Pettigo, along with other bombing incidents in the State between 1970 and 1974. Consideration is now underway by relevant Departments and the Attorney General. The report will then be considered by the Government. It is the intention that the report be then considered by the Oireachtas and published.</p>
            <p eId="para_2584">Judge Barron is expected to report on the case of Seamus Ludlow towards the end of the year. He will then report on other cases including the Dundalk bombing of 1975 and in the context of that report, he will report on a number of other bombings that took place after May 1974 including the Castleblaney bombing.</p>

            <p eId="para_2586">Some 4,000 enumerators were employed by the Central Statistics Office to conduct the fieldwork for the 2002 census of population. The enumerators delivered blank census forms to all households in the State in the five week period before census day, 28 April 2002. In the five weeks after census day, they collected the completed forms and subsequently returned them to CSO. A total of 1.29 million households were covered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2587">The majority of householders co-operated fully with the enumerators in ensuring that their completed census forms were ready for collection after census day. In a number of cases where the householder was not initially convinced of the necessity of returning their completed census form, a further visit by the enumerator or the relevant field supervisor usually resulted in the satisfactory completion of the form.</p>
            <p eId="para_2588">The estimated number of persons who failed to respond to the census is not precisely known. However, every attempt was made at local level to keep the number of such cases to an absolute minimum. The enumerator and her supervisor highlighted the importance of the census operation to the non-compliant householder and the obligation under law to complete the census form. Where a refusal resulted from this procedure, the enumerator using his or her local knowledge was normally in a position to provide the relevant details. While it would not have been practical to prosecute all of the non-repondents it was decided to take proceedings against three individuals who failed to comply. Two of these resulted in successful prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2589">The CSO policy is to emphasise the importance of 100% compliance with the census in order to ensure up to date and comprehensive information on the population at local, regional and national level. A public awareness campaign is mounted around the time of the census to get this message across to the public. However, through the prosecutions it has taken to date, CSO will make it clear in future censuses that it will have no hesitation in prosecuting non-respondents.</p>

            <p eId="para_2705">In recent months, I have met with delegations from the Donegal County Development Board and from IBEC north-west to discuss employment and related issues in Donegal and the north-west region in general. As a result, I have arranged for the expert skills group in Forfas to carry out research on the labour market needs of the area. The research work began last month and I expect that a report will be available in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_2706">Over the last few years, IDA Ireland has secured new investment for the north-west, including Donegal from companies such as Abbott Laboratories, MBNA, Prumerica, PacifiCare and Keith Prowse in Buncrana. All of these companies are recruiting at present. Enterprise Ireland has been very active in supporting the development of enterprise space in the north-west. A total of 24 Community Enterprise Centres have been funded in the region including ten in Donegal. In addition, ten companies in the north-west region, including five in Donegal, have been approved for funding under Enterprise Ireland's competitiveness fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_2707">The development agencies continue to try to source new investment for Donegal and are committed to playing their part in the development of the north-west region by maintaining the maximum number of existing jobs and by attracting new investment into the region. The recently announced decentralisation programme will also facilitate economic development in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2712">The monitoring and implementation of the recommendations of the Donegal task force report have been allocated to the Donegal County Development Board. The county development board completed a ten year strategy for the development of the county and this was launched in 2002. The current focus of the county development board is on progressing a number of key economic infrastructure projects in the county. The priority action areas are roads, water, telecoms including broadband, air access and energy, both electricity and gas. Progress in these areas is important in attracting further new investment into the county. All of these issues were discussed at my last meeting with the Donegal County Development Board and I am continuing to keep in touch with developments in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2713">The industrial development agencies continue to try and secure new investment for Donegal and are committed to playing their part in the future development of the county by attracting new investment into Donegal. These agencies, together with FÁS, are all represented on the county development board. Finally, the Government and the development agencies are committed to ensuring balanced regional development particularly through the implementation of the national spatial strategy and the recently announced decentralisation programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2717">According to the latest quarterly national household survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 16 June 2004, unemployment in the border area is at 5.4%. The corresponding figure this time last year was 6.2%. The live register figures for June 2004 show that in the north-west region, numbers decreased by more than 7% against a national average decrease of 5%. The Donegal live register rate decreased by 5% between June 2003 and June 2004, down from 10,680 to 10,146. Although the live register is not a true record of the level of unemployment, as it includes people who are not available for work, it is a useful indicator of current employment trends. These statistics indicate that the actions being taken by the industrial development agencies are impacting positively on Donegal and the north-west region in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_2718">Support for job creation is a day to day operational matter for the industrial development agencies. Job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development worldwide as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change. In the case of redundancies or lay-offs the employment services division of FÁS provides a full service to the unemployed job seeker. This service is offered by FÁS through its network of employment services offices and clinics. It consists of matching suitable people to job vacancies, providing guidance interviews and placement on suitable training courses. In addition, FÁS north-west region has two training centres in Donegal, located in Letterkenny and Gweedore, delivering apprenticeship and specific skills courses. The expert skills group in Forfas is currently engaged in carrying out research on the labour market needs of the north-west. In addition, the enterprise strategy group, which I established in July, 2003, was given the task of developing strategic policy recommendations for enterprise in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2719">I am satisfied that a combined agency approach, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards, together with the involvement of local business communities, will address the job creation needs.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_934">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2834">A key element of the insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October 2002 is to implement the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan. Significant progress has been made in implementing the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and I am confident that these implementing measures will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. The key measures include the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act was signed into law on 28 December 2003. The board was established and members appointed on 13 April 2004. The PIAB commenced dealing with employer liability cases from 1 June 2004 and it is my intention that it will commence dealing with motor and public liability claims from autumn 2004 or earlier. A book of quantum, an aid for assessing the level of compensation based on the type of injury involved and which is essential for the successful operation of the PIAB, was published by PIAB on 2 June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2835">Other measures include the undertaking by my Department and the Competition Authority of a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. The bulk of the study was completed in 2003 and a preliminary report and consultation document on competition issues in the non-life insurance market was published on 18 February 2004. Following consultation, a final report will be published later in the year which will contain recommendations based on the findings. Significant progress has been made by the Department of Transport on the implementation of the road safety strategy. For example, the introduction of the penalty points system has already reduced the number of accidents on our roads, which has benefits far beyond the cost of insurance. The Road Traffic Bill 2004 was published on 22 June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the Civil Liability and Courts Bill on 11 February 2004. It is expected that this Bill will have passed all stages of the Dáil and Seanad this week and enactment will take place at the earliest date possible. This Bill contains measures to streamline the law on personal injury claims including measures to deal with fraudulent and exaggerated claims. The MIAB recommended that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority is charged with progressing, deal with issues relating to public information, promotion of competition, transparency and consumer protection. Recommendations implemented since it began operations on 1 May 2003 include a one stop website went live on 26 November 2003; an IFSRA code of practice published during December 2003; and comparative tables showing motor insurance quotations published on a quarterly basis since 10 December 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">The Irish Insurance Federation has incorporated a number of the MIAB recommendations on insurance providers in a code of practice. These recommendations deal with issues such as equality, transparency and information issues for consumers. While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance, I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses. Indications to date are that the insurance reform programme is having its desired effect. The CSO publishes monthly indices of costs for a number of classes of insurance. These statistics show that there was a reduction of 12.9 index points, or 12.1%, in motor car insurance between the months of October 2002, when the programme was launched and April 2004, which is the latest figure available. Reductions are also beginning to occur in the cost of employers' liability and public liability insurance premia, which represent a significant burden for businesses. As implementation of the reform programme continues, I expect further reductions to occur. I am also confident that the measures the Government is putting in place to reform the Irish insurance market will attract new players into the market leading to further downward pressure on premia.</p>

            <p eId="para_2839">IDA Ireland is actively marketing Cavan for potential foreign inward investment. The IDA has recently completed a €1 million upgrading of Cavan business park to raise its profile and increase its attractiveness for inward investment. The former Teradyne building on the park is currently available for occupation by investors. In addition, IDA Ireland received planning permission for two further 25,000 square feet advance technology buildings on Cavan business park at the end of 2002. IDA is also cognisant of the range of smaller buildings provided through private developers in Cavan and through bodies associated with Cavan County Enterprise Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_2840">Construction of the new Abbott Laboratories facility at Cootehill, which was announced by the healthcare company as part of an €88 million investment plan in December 2002 and was supported by Enterprise Ireland, is nearing completion. Currently approximately 50 of the proposed 100 new jobs have been created with recruitment for the remaining jobs ongoing. Enterprise Ireland provides preferential funding for companies, with detailed export plans, who are expanding or establishing a business in the County. In 2004 to date, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of €611,426 to eight companies in County Cavan. Enterprise Ireland's strategy is to further develop the building and construction materials sector in County Cavan, as well as a number of food companies. Enterprise Ireland has also approved funding for community enterprise centres in Cavan, Kingscourt, Bailieboro, Cootehill, and Killeshandra. Enterprise Ireland also works with companies to assist them in improving competitiveness. Enterprise Ireland's €10 million competitiveness fund, which I announced in May 2003, was set up to help small and medium enterprises overcome distinctive competitiveness difficulties. Under this fund three applications in County Cavan were successful in competing for funding to the amount of €448,380.</p>
            <p eId="para_2841">I am confident that the efforts of the industrial development agencies in partnership with other local organisations as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development, which will see some 380 further civil servants transferred to Cavan under the decentralisation programme, will bring positive results to Cavan.</p>

            <p eId="para_2943">The roles of the Defence Forces as assigned by Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in February 2000. To aid the civil power, which means in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, is among the assigned roles. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assisted the gardaí as required in duties, which included the security operation surrounding the ceremonies marking the accession of new member states to the EU on 1 May 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2944">I am advised that over 2,500 personnel were deployed in various roles in connection with the security operation. In addition, the Naval Service was on patrol in the Irish Sea and the Air Corps provided air traffic control capability and support to operations both at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel and in the Phoenix Park. The additional costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of assistance to the Garda Síochána on 1 May amounted to approximately €872,650. A breakdown of these costs is shown on the attached schedule.</p>

Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.</p>
            <p eId="para_2994">The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are the following. Persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>

Although the details of the person seeking access to the scheme is not clear, there are a number of tax reliefs which may be of benefit.

            <p eId="para_2997">I am taking it that the Deputy is referring in the first instance to farmers' markets that have become increasingly popular venues for local producers of foodstuffs to promote and sell their produce. I have been informed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food that Bord Bia, the food State agency, is active in promoting and encouraging this route to market for small producers. In 2002, Bord Bia was instrumental in promoting this concept when it staged Ireland's largest ever outdoor foodmarket on the farmers market style for 110 small food producers at its international food symposium in Kinsale. Since then and in partnership with the OPW, Bord Bia has run a farmers' market in Farmleigh for nine weeks from September to October 2003 attracting more than 35,000 visitors who bought produce direct from stallholders. I have been informed that Bord Bia is planning a further Farmleigh market later this year and is in discussion with the OPW about appropriate expansion of farmers markets on OPW sites. Bord Bia has also dedicated a section of its website to the promotion of the farmers markets concept which includes a list of farmers markets in Ireland and a online leaflet offering practical advice on setting up such markets. It is my view that this approach, which involves the promotion of farmers' markets through the dissemination of information and practical advice rather than the introduction of tax incentives, is a more appropriate and effective measure in promoting the development of this route to market for such producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2998">With regard to the request for tax incentives to encourage the production, distribution and sale of food certified under the Fairtrade mark it should be pointed out that the sale of such food like all food attracts a zero rate of VAT. While the Deputy has not made it clear what type of tax incentives he is seeking, it should be borne in mind that foodstuffs certified under the Fairtrade mark are increasingly sold and distributed by a wide range of enterprises rather than speciality shops and enterprises that deal exclusively in Fairtrade mark products. The introduction of a separate tax treatment on the profits accruing from the sale and distribution of such goods would introduce an inordinate level of complexity into the tax code for the taxation of profits of retail and food distribution undertakings and inevitably lead to calls for similar treatment from other sectors. In addition, this would amount to a lower rate of tax on such profits and would thus not be allowed under EU State aid rules. For all these reasons there are no plans to change the tax treatment of profits accruing from the production, distribution or sale of such goods.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_950">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
            <p eId="para_3039">The following 26 OPW managed properties have been used for non-Government organised events in 2004: Dublin Castle; Royal Hospital Kilmainham; Farmleigh; 51-52 St. Stephen's Green; the Atrium Altamont Gardens, County Carlow; Donegal Castle, County Donegal; Phoenix Park, Dublin 8; Garden of Remembrance, Dublin 1; St. Stephen's Green Park, Dublin 2; Iveagh Gardens, Dublin 2; National War Memorial Gardens, Dublin 8; Rathfarnham Castle, Dublin 14; St. Enda's Park, Dublin 16; National Botanic Gardens, Dublin 9; Athenry Castle, County Galway; Castletown, County Kildare; Kilkenny Castle, Kilkenny; Emo Court, County Laois; Desmond Hall, County Limerick; Bru na Boinne, County Meath; Hill of Tara, County Meath; Boyle Abbey, County Roscommon; Mainguard, Clonmel, County Tipperary; Roscrea Castle, County Tipperary; Dungarvan Castle, County Waterford; Tintern Abbey, County Wexford. The arrangements made for the use of the properties may vary depending on the property concerned and the nature of the event.</p>
            <p eId="para_3040">Dublin Castle is the main OPW property in which non-Government events are held. For the first six months of 2004, Dublin Castle was not available for private hire because it was being used exclusively for meetings and events of the Irish EU Presidency. To date in 2004 only two non-Government organised events have been held there. Application to use Dublin Castle is made through local management and, if agreed, is subject to a standard hiring contract. The majority of such events would be conferences, seminars, exhibitions or receptions and would have no impact on local communities. However, for the past number of years outdoor public concerts have been held in Dublin Castle on the May bank holiday weekend. These concerts were held under planning permission granted by Dublin City Council to the organisers and this permission contained conditions designed to minimise impact on the surrounding community. In 2004 these concerts were held on the June bank holiday weekend and were subject to recent regulations governing the holding of certain outdoor events. These regulations require that certain outdoor events must have an event plan drawn up by the organisers and agreed with the statutory authorities such the gardaí, emergency services, planning authority and so on. Apart from ensuring the health and safety of attendees the purpose of this agreed plan is to minimise disruption to local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3041">The hiring contract to which I referred provides that the person organising the event must provide evidence of adequate public and employer liability insurance. Fees are charged for the use of the properties within Dublin Castle. There is a number of different event venues within the Dublin Castle complex and each has different capacities. Hire charges range from €1,460 to €12,700 per day depending on the venue chosen. There is no formal set of criteria drawn up to assess the suitability of events. In deciding whether to allow use of the property local management has regard to the nature of the event, its appropriateness in terms of form and content and its potential impact on both the image and fabric of Dublin Castle.</p>
            <p eId="para_3042">The OPW manages the north range of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham as an event venue on behalf of the Irish Museum of Modern Art which is a tenant of that property. As with Dublin Castle, the RHK was not available for private hire in the first six months of 2004 due to the EU Presidency. Only two non-Government events have been held in this property to date in 2004. The same provisions governing the use of Dublin Castle apply at this property also.</p>
            <p eId="para_3043">Farmleigh is not available for non-Government organised use. However, from 24 July 2004 to 30 July 2004, as part of the Farmleigh public access events programme, RTE, in conjunction with OPW, will present the RTE Farmleigh proms- a week long series of concerts free to the public. The proms were held in 2003 also. RTE will be required to produce evidence of insurance for this event. There is no charge for use of Farmleigh for this event. Planning permission has been granted for use of Farmleigh for public events such as the proms. A detailed traffic management plan formed part of the planning application.</p>
            <p eId="para_3044">Most of the events held at the other 23 properties on the above list, with the exception of the recent large concert in the Phoenix Park and the national country fair at Emo Court, have been on a small scale ranging from poetry and musical recitals, launches and receptions to sporting events. They were predominantly organised by local community groups or charitable and sporting organisations, and local communities were consulted as appropriate. All such events organised at heritage properties are covered by public liability insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3045">Each application to stage an event is examined on its merits with reference to the nature and purpose of the event, to the social and cultural benefits obtaining, the infrastructure and conservation needs of the site and the integrity of the property in question. I refer the Deputy to the replies given to Questions No. 502 of 7 October 2003, No. 53 of 16 October 2003 and No. 146 of 1 June 2004 on events held in the Phoenix Park.</p>
            <p eId="para_3046">A fee was charged for the holding of the national country fair in Emo Court. The site and facilities were particularly appropriate for such an event but the main consideration was to raise the profile of and to publicise, and disseminate information about this magnificent but relatively unknown property nationally.</p>

            <p eId="para_3050">Fees payable to legal personnel acting on behalf of the State in tribunals of inquiry are subject to my sanction after obtaining the advice of the Attorney General and the views of the sponsoring Department of the respective tribunal. There have been no increases in <i>per diem</i> rates for counsel in ongoing tribunals of inquiry since July 2002. The increase in 2002 was the only increase since the establishment of the Flood and Moriarty tribunals — see table below.</p>
            <p eId="para_3051">I have a number of proposals under consideration aimed at reducing the legal costs of tribunals and other forms of inquiry. I am liaising with the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard. These proposals will require the approval of Government and I am not therefore at liberty at this juncture to go into individual detail of these proposals but broadly they are aimed at addressing a number of issues including the following; review of basis of payment for legal representatives; tightening and better focusing of the terms of reference of future tribunals with a view to minimising duration and costs and, streamlining the operation of tribunals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3052">I understand that recent legislation introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides for competitive tendering in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3097">The Deputy is presumably referring to the impact of the new rules arising from the introduction of the recent EU savings directive on new prize bonds. This directive was implemented in Irish law by section 90 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Finance Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3098">The directive provides for most EU member states to exchange information on the cross-Border payment of interest to individuals resident in another member state. Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg will instead impose a withholding tax on such interest payments. The directive applies only to the savings income of individuals. For the purposes of the directive interest payment includes prizes attaching to a security. Prize bonds are defined in Irish legislation as non-interest-bearing securities in relation to which chance may be used to select particular securities for prizes. Prize bond prizes, therefore, come within the scope of the directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3099">The directive prescribes the rules to be applied to establish the identity and country of residence of beneficial owners of an interest payment — more stringent rules apply where prize bonds are purchased by an individual for the first time from 1 January last. Where these rules show that an individual is resident in another EU member state, the directive requires that information as regards the prize and the winner be reported to the authorities of that member state. As recently agreed at EU level, the obligation to exchange information comes into operation as respects an interest payment made on or after 1 July 2005. On the application of the rules to give effect to this provision, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners are already in discussion with the National Treasury Management Agency and the prize bond operator with a view to minimising the paperwork concerned in the purchase of prize bonds.</p>

            <p eId="para_3102">It is not the practice of the Revenue Commissioners to comment on specific charities. However, on the matter of accounts and accounting practices, all tax exempted charities are required to maintain proper books of account and records as this is a condition attaching to their exemption. Bodies which are granted charitable exemption are subject to periodic review with a view to ensuring their continued compliance with the terms of the exemption. The failure to keep proper financial records by a tax exempted charity would be considered a breach of the obligations associated with the exemption.</p>

            <p eId="para_3113">An efficient, modern and inclusive education system is one of the key elements in the development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a fully functioning European state.</p>
            <p eId="para_3114">In November 2002, the OSCE, in co-operation with the Bosnian education authorities, published a comprehensive education reform strategy which included proposals for the reform of higher education. On the basis of the strategy, a draft framework law on higher education was prepared by a team of experts, including representatives of the education ministries of the Bosnian Federation and of the Republika Srpska, the mainly ethnic-Serb entity.</p>
            <p eId="para_3115">The aim of the draft framework law is to increase significantly the number of students with access to higher education and to enable the recognition of Bosnian qualifications in other European countries. It would enable the universities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to participate in the European higher education area under the Bologna process and the Lisbon recognition convention and encourage greater mobility of students and academics within Bosnia and throughout Europe. Implementation of the law would also meet an important condition of Bosnia's membership of the Council of Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_3116">I regret that the state parliament was unable to pass the framework law on higher education on 7 May as a result of the invoking by a number of deputies of the vital national interest protection procedure. The matter has now been referred to the constitutional court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a ruling on the invoking of the protection procedure. In a statement on 11 May, the Office of the High Representative for Bosnia, Lord Ashdown, and the OSCE Mission in Bosnia noted that continued failure to pass the law would contribute to an increase in the numbers of ambitious young people leaving Bosnia and Herzegovina for countries in the EU and elsewhere, where the standards proposed in the framework law are already in force. The adoption of the law had been a condition for the release of a World Bank loan, in part for investment in the education sector. The World Bank has now restructured its direct budget support for Bosnia and Herzegovina and has specifically linked the release of $24 million in structural adjustment credits to the successful completion of key reforms, including adoption of a satisfactory framework law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3117">Bosnia faces enormous challenges in overcoming the legacy of violence and division from the 1990s and working towards the goal of eventual integration into EU structures on the basis of the shared agenda agreed at the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003. In November 2003, the Commission completed a feasibility study on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina. It identified 16 major areas of reform and concluded that if significant progress were made in each of them, the Commission would hope to recommend to the Council by the end of this year that negotiations could begin. The Government has worked closely with the Commission, with the High Representative for Bosnia and with the Bosnian authorities over the past six months of Ireland's EU Presidency. There have been some very positive developments. I would like to pay tribute to the determination of the Bosnian authorities to pursue an ambitious reform agenda and to legislate for reform. The EU is encouraging them strongly to continue this progress and to focus in particular on the implementation of reforms over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3118">The European Union will continue to work closely with the Bosnian authorities, and with the High Representative for Bosnia, Lord Ashdown, in the task of consolidating peace and democracy and implementing the reforms required for Bosnia's progress towards a closer institutional relationship with the EU. Last month, the Council adopted European partnerships for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the other countries of the Western Balkans. The partnerships draw on the experience of the current enlargement process and set out specific areas of reform in which progress is required for further movement in the integration process. The June European Council also adopted a comprehensive policy on Bosnia and Herzegovina outlining the practical arrangements to strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of the EU's involvement with Bosnia. This involvement will develop significantly by the end of 2004 with the transition from the UN-mandated, NATO-led peacekeeping force, SFOR, and the launch of an EU mission, including a military component.</p>

However, the information will be compiled from the records maintained in my Department and in so far as it is available, it will be issued directly to the Deputy in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3121">On the other matters raised by the Deputy in relation to means-testing arrangements for third level grants, the position is that in accordance with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, it is my intention to introduce a unified scheme on a statutory basis. I also propose to put in place a more coherent administration system which will, I believe, facilitate the introduction of more sophisticated means testing arrangements and ensure consistency of application and client accessibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_3122">The Deputy will be aware that the report, Supporting Equity in Higher Education in 2003, identified the fairness of the means assessment on which student support is based as being a vitally important issue in promoting equity. It noted that the current system is widely regarded as being inequitable and, in line with earlier reports, concluded that the introduction of a capital test would remove a significant perceived inequity in the system. The report also concluded, in this context, that the administration of the student support schemes needs to be reformed. In this connection, the Deputy will be aware that my Department has commenced discussions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to establish the extent to which these Departments can assist in the streamlining of the administration of the single unified scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3123">It is my intention that there will be full consultation with all interested parties and that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements prior to such consultation taking place. My Department has and will be meeting with the representative groups. When these discussions are concluded, I will be in a position to make a final determination as to the most efficient and effective arrangements for the future administration of the schemes. Any review of means-testing would not target any specific sector but would aim to ensure that the grants system is fair and equitable and that the resources are allocated accordingly in a fair manner to achieve the Government's objective of supporting and facilitating greater participation in further and higher education from hitherto under-represented socio-economic groups.</p>

Aithním go bhfuil fadhbanna ann fós. Caithfear tuilleadh infheistíochta a dhéanamh i gcumasú múinteoirí sna modhanna múinte is fearr. Caithfear féachaint chuige go bhfaigheann na mic léinn sna coláistí oideachais an réamhoiliúint is fearr ní hamháin le haghaidh teagaisc i ngnáthscoileanna ach i scoileanna lánGhaeilge agus scoileanna Gaeltachta chomh maith.

The scheme provides significant improvements for schools, pupils and teachers in relation to arrangements for supervision and substitution by extending the normal substitution arrangements to cover absences on uncertified sick leave and certain other approved absences and by providing funding to schools to pay teachers already employed in the school to commit to and be paid for supervision and substitution over and above their normal class contact hours where qualified substitutes from outside the school are not available.</p>

            <p eId="para_3182">I understand that Mayo County Council has raised the issue of the construction of the Corrib gas field onshore pipeline in deep peat soil with the developers in the context of their planning application for the onshore terminal at Bellanaboy Bridge. I can inform the Deputy that up to now only a very small element of the proposed pipeline work has been commenced. No work has been completed, with the exception of some pipeline route exploration work, in relation to the onshore pipeline.</p>
            <p eId="para_3183">To date, approval to undertake pipeline works on the Corrib gas field development specifically for phase 1, nearshore trench construction, phase 2, landfall and, part of phase 3, onshore pipeline construction, has been issued to the developers. When the final application to install the onshore pipeline for phase 3 is received, the issue of deep peat soil will be examined along with all other matters such as design, trench depth and compliance with conditions attaching to pipeline consent of 15 April 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_3184">The Deputy will no doubt be aware that my Department commissioned an evaluation of the onshore pipeline design code. The report indicated that the design code has been selected in accordance with best public safety considerations and is appropriate for the pipeline operating conditions and subject to the developers undertaking to comply with a number of conditions incorporated in the consent to construct. The pipeline design is generally in accordance with best national and international industry practice and is considered to meet public safety requirements.</p>

The VHI has stated that the level of increases decided by the board is less than previous years and significantly less than the rate of increase in the cost of medical care which is currently running at over 10% per annum. VHI has stated that this increase in premiums will be applied totally to finance new benefits and services for members.</p>

            <p eId="para_3211">Persons resident in Ireland who are in receipt of a social security pension from another EU member state, including the UK, and are not in receipt of a pension from the Irish Department of Social and Family Affairs, or are not employed or self employed in Ireland, are eligible to receive medical cards under EU regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3212">As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the delivery of health services in Ireland falls to seven regional health boards and one regional health authority. These bodies are the main providers of health services at regional level. Each health board-authority has a chief executive officer, CEO, who has responsibility for day-to-day administration of the services. Eligibility for health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than payment of income tax or social insurance. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility — category 1, namely, medical card holders — or limited eligibility — namely category 2 — for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident if she-he satisfies the health board that it is his-her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3213">Income guidelines are drawn up by the CEOs to assist in determining a person's eligibility for a medical card and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. All persons aged 70 or over are automatically eligible for a medical card, irrespective of their income. Persons who receive a medical card are entitled to a full range of services free of charge, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3214">Alternatively, a person who is considered resident in Ireland may opt to take out private health insurance. The main private health insurance companies in Ireland are VHI and BUPA. Details of the health insurance schemes offered by each can be obtained by contacting the insurers directly or by contacting the Health Insurance Authority.</p>

          <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_991">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
            <p eId="para_3216">The Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science have been working together at national level to enhance the level of educational and health-related support services available to children with special educational needs, including those with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_3217">The Government has invested an additional amount of around €643 million in health funded services for people with disabilities since 1997. This includes around €388 million allocated to services for people with autism and those with an intellectual disability to provide a broad range of support services including residential, respite, day and home support services. Since 1998 approximately €16 million has been put into the system to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and multi-disciplinary support services — speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, psychology and other support services — for children with autism and those with an intellectual disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3218">Several key developments were noted in the 2003 annual report from the national intellectual disability database, including the continued expansion in the availability of residential support services, in particular service-based respite services, which had grown by 314%, with an additional 520 people reported as being in receipt of these services between 2002 and 2003 alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_3219">Notwithstanding the additional funding described above, one of the major difficulties facing the health services in delivering support services to people with disabilities is the shortage of certain professionals such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists.</p>
            <p eId="para_3220">Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of training places in line with the recommendations of the report entitled, Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, commissioned by my Department from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. In May 2002, the Minister for Health and Children announced, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, an additional 175 therapy training places in physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy to achieve the recommended increase in the number of therapists over the next decade recommended in the report. These additional places have now come on stream.</p>
            <p eId="para_3221">There has also been a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast-track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. The success of these measures is reflected in the increases in speech and language therapists and occupational therapists employed in the public health service over the last three year period to end of 2002, with a 73% increase in occupational therapists and a 33% increase in speech and language therapists.</p>
            <p eId="para_3222">In relation to legislation, the Government intends, as promised in the Agreed Programme for Government, to bring forward a disability Bill which includes provisions for rights of assessment and for appeals, provision and enforcement. The Bill is being finalised and will be published as soon as the Government has completed its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_3223">In relation to medical cards, no person or group of persons, other than those aged 70 years and over, is automatically entitled to a medical card. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In determining eligibility, the CEO has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the CEO considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</p>
            <p eId="para_3224">The provision of services to people with autism and intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities is one of the limited number of areas in which additional revenue funding has been provided by the Government in any Department over 2003 and 2004. In respect of services to persons with autism and intellectual disability, this revenue funding, amounting to €43 million up to the end of 2004, was specifically provided to meet costs associated with the provision of emergency residential placements, extra day services particularly for young adults leaving school and to enhance the health-related support services for children. This is very visible evidence of the Government's commitment in this area.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_992">
            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3226">The National Disease Surveillance Centre recently published HIV figures for 2003. There were 399 newly diagnosed cases in 2003, representing a 10% increase on 2002. This brings the total number of cases of HIV infection diagnosed to the end of 2003 to 3,408.</p>
            <p eId="para_3227">Of the 399 newly diagnosed cases where exposure category is known, 221 were heterosexually acquired. This compares to 232 in 2002 and 173 in 2001. There were 75 new diagnoses among men who have sex with men, MSM, during 2003. This compares with 46 newly diagnosed HIV infections during 2002 and 71 in 2001. There were 47 newly diagnosed among IDUs during 2003 compared to 50 in 2002 and 38 in 2001. Of the 399 newly diagnosed cases, 202, or 50.6% were male and 196, or 49.1%, were female. Information on gender is not available for one of newly diagnosed cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_3228">The report of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, NASC, which was published in 2000, makes a range of recommendations for dealing with HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, STIs. My Department through the National AIDS Strategy Committee and its sub-committees on education and prevention, surveillance and care and management is working to implement these recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">In relation to HIV and other STIs, our first line of defence must be education and awareness. In this regard the National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005 acknowledges that sexuality is an integral part of being human and healthy sexual relationships can contribute to an overall sense of well-being. A strategic aim of the Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005 is "to promote safer sexual health and safer sexual practices among the population."</p>
            <p eId="para_3230">Education and prevention measures are co-ordinated by the health promotion unit of my Department within the context of both the National Health Promotion Strategy and the report of the National AIDS Strategy Committee 2000. In fulfilment of objectives and recommendations set out in these strategies the health promotion unit is involved in and supports a range of initiatives and interventions aimed at preventing and raising awareness of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The following are some examples of the current priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3231">In the school setting, my Department is working in partnership with the Department of Education and Science and the Health Boards to support schools in the introduction and delivery of Social Personal and Health Education, SPHE, at both primary and post primary level. Relationships and sexuality education is an integral part of this curriculum and remains a key priority for this work with schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">In the out of school setting the health promotion unit of my Department works in partnership with the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland to implement the national youth health programme. The aim of the programme is to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion-education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in the non-formal education sector. Within the context of this programme, a training initiative called Too Hot to Handle is offered to youth workers which addresses the issues of relationships, sexuality and sexual health with young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_3233">A national public awareness advertising campaign has been established to promote sexual health which is aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 age group to increase awareness about safe sex, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The overall goal is to increase safe sex, reducing the incidence of HIV, other STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies among young people in Ireland. The campaign runs in third-level colleges, places of entertainment, such as pubs, clubs, discos and youth clubs. This national programme has been running for several years and a new and revised campaign is currently being implemented by the health promotion unit, which has greatly increased the number of venues targeted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3234">My Department and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency are conducting a national survey of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of adults living in Ireland. This survey is a direct response to documented rises in HIV, STIs and unwanted pregnancies in Ireland and offers the prospect of increasing our understanding of the pattern of health behaviours in the area of sexual health and their relationship to both attitudes and beliefs and socio-demographic characteristics of individuals. Such a survey will: provide robust information in the area of sexual health that will feed into the planning and development of services, sexual health policies and strategies; assist with more efficient allocation of resources; and, provide quality baseline data for future surveys of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour to monitor change over time and allow for long term planning. The collection of national information on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour is an important first step in assisting individuals, organisations and policy makers working in the area of sexual health promotion to plan and work towards meeting the sexual health needs of people living in Ireland. The health promotion unit also produces a range of awareness-raising leaflets on HIV, STIs and safe sex practices which are available through health promotion departments in each health board.</p>
            <p eId="para_3235">In addition to this ongoing work within my Department, a number of other important initiatives are underway which should go a long way to improving the overall sexual health of the population. Both statutory and non-governmental bodies are working in partnership to improve sexual health and promote safer sexual practices; a number of health boards are implementing sexual health strategies, with dedicated human and financial resources allocated regionally. Also health boards and voluntary organisations have in place targeted initiatives aimed at the drug using population and MSM.</p>
            <p eId="para_3236">Almost €5.5 million additional funding has been provided to health boards since 1997 to address the treatment of HIV-AIDS and other STIs. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the facilities in place. At present there are seven consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV-AIDS-STIs. Five of these are in Dublin — one of whom deals with children — one in Cork and a recently appointed infectious disease consultant in Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_3237">The care and management sub-committee of NASC visited hospitals and health boards involved in the provision of services to people with HIV-AIDS and STIs. The purpose of these visits was to identify gaps and make recommendations for the future direction of treatment services. The report of the sub-committee is currently being finalised. My Department will continue to closely monitor the position in relation to HIV-AIDS and other STIs.</p>

            <p eId="para_3246">I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 to 229, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3247">The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for the provision of services at Cavan General Hospital rests with the North Eastern Health Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_3248">Following the publication of the report into the circumstances surrounding the death of the person in question, I met the chief executive officer of the board last week. The report contains 22 recommendations of which eight are classified as high priority and 14 as medium priority. The board has advised me that most of the high priority recommendations have already been put in place and that it is working to ensure compliance with all of the recommendations. I have instructed the board to take steps to implement all recommendations as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_3249">With regard to some of the specific queries raised by the Deputy, I am advised by the board that the consultant in emergency medicine was not on duty in Cavan on the day in question; however there were three non-consultant hospital doctors, four nurses and a care attendant on duty in the A &amp;  E department when the patient presented. I am further advised that the referral letter from the family's general practitioner is on the child's medical file. As the Deputy is aware, a steering group for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group has been established. The group will determine the level of service to be provided at each site, taking into account available resources, quality of care and safe practice.

            <p eId="para_3253">I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 to 233, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3254">As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards-authority in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3255">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Northern Area Health Board, NAHB, area of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and on a national basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3256">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics — including five from the ERHA. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3257">Orthodontic initiative funding of €2.044 million was provided to the ERHA in 2001 and this has enabled the authority to recruit additional staff and build additional orthodontic facilities. The authority has developed additional orthodontic facilities at Loughlinstown, Ashtown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_3258">In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund towards the treatment of persons on the orthodontic waiting lists; the ERHA received €1.815 million from this fund. My Department instructed the health boards-authority that the funding was to be allocated on the basis of the following principles: first, treatment of clients longest on the waiting list in accordance with the severity of their treatment need; second, allocation to provide additional treatments over and above what was provided in the normal way; third, efficiency and value for money; and fourth, equitable delivery across health board populations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3259">The management of orthodontic staff in the Eastern Regional Health Authority is the statutory responsibility of the regional chief executive. Therefore, my Department has asked the regional chief executive to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3260">Finally, the regional chief executive of the authority has informed my Department that at the end of the March quarter 2004, there were 3,782 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service in the ERHA.</p>

            <p eId="para_3262">My Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Belfast, DHSSPS, commissioned a feasibility study and report on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical services, HEMS, for the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3263">The decision to commission the study followed a recommendation by a cross border working group on pre-hospital emergency care, one of a number of groups established under the North-South Ministerial Council to examine areas of North-South co-operation in the health field.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">The report of the consultants appointed to undertake the study was published on 30 April 2004 and is available on my Department's website. The study identifies possible roles for a helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS: primary response, which entails travelling directly to the scene of an incident to take the patient to hospital, and inter-hospital response, which entails the planned, rapid transfer between hospital of patients requiring specialist care, escorted by skilled professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">The study concludes that an inter-hospital transfer service would be the most appropriate in an all-island context. The study indicates that this would involve significant capital investment and annual operating costs. The estimated cost is €12 million capital and €4 million annual operating costs for a single helicopter. Additional helicopters could be added with an additional annual cost for each aircraft of over €3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3266">An air ambulance service is currently provided to the health boards by the air corps on a request and availability basis. The air corps provides this service subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3267">Air corps helicopters operate from airports and, where available and deemed safe, hospital helipads. Most transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance. The service is well regarded and appreciated by those in the health service who avail of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_3268">My Department is exploring options in relation to HEMS development in the light of the recent study. As part of this exercise, it has initiated discussions with the Department of Defence and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources — Irish Coast Guard.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
            <p eId="para_3270">The circular for motorised transport grant states that all health boards may pay a grant towards the purchase of a car and-or adaptions to a car being purchased by a person with a severe disability who is 17 years or older and up to 65 years of age, where such a car is essential for him-her to obtain or retain employment. Self-employed persons who satisfy the criteria of eligibility may also be considered, subject to the above age limits. In cases, where application is made on the basis of obtaining or retaining employment or self employment, the board must be satisfied that the applicant is capable of holding down a job, has the physical capacity to drive the vehicle and is qualified to hold a driver's licence, full or provisional. However, qualified persons with a disability who are incapable of driving or who have been medically advised not to drive, and who have to be driven to and from his-her place of employment will only be considered eligible for a grant provided that she-he will be driven by another named person to and from his-her place of employment. The car must be purchased in the name of the person with a disability. The grant may also be considered in exceptional circumstances for a person with a severe disability, subject to the above age limits, who lives in a very remote location and whose disability impedes him-her from using public transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3271">There are no specific disabilities which are excluded from eligibility for the motorised transport grant provided the person applying for the grant meets the eligibility criteria. The Deputy should be aware that the working group established to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment proposes to examine the scope for rationalising and streamlining the various disability support measures, with a particular focus on mitigating the additional costs of disability for a greater number of people with disabilities, particularly in the case of those who wish to move from a position of total welfare dependence to one of greater economic independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3272">It is expected that the first area the working group will examine will be all mobility-related schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_3276">My Department is involved in a wide range of partnerships with other Government Departments and bodies in an effort to tackle the issue of under age drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_3277">My Department, in partnership with the Department of Education and Science, has developed a social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme, which addresses the issue of substance misuse in the schools setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_3278">Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_3279">In accordance with action 43 of the national drugs strategy, the Department of Education and Science in partnership with the health promotion unit of my Department and the health boards, has issued guidelines for developing a school substance abuse policy to all primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3280">The national youth health promotion programme with support from the health promotion unit of my Department initiated a national project which provided opportunities for young people, 14-16 years, to explore their relationship with alcohol. Training is provided for youth leaders to ensure the implementation of this initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_3281">The health promotion unit of my Department has recently completed a three year alcohol awareness campaign entitled Think Before You Drink — Less Is More. Some phases of the campaign focused on those who buy or supply alcohol to those under age with a poster and radio messages with the theme of keeping children safe from drink.</p>
            <p eId="para_3282">The responsible serving of alcohol, RSA, programme is a training initiative which was developed by the health promotion unit in association with the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland specifically for those who work in the bar trade and hospitality sector. The aim of the programme is to limit harm in the drinking environment by not serving to intoxicated customers, encouraging the use of age cards to prevent under age people from being served and promoting alternative strategies to reduce drink driving.</p>
            <p eId="para_3283">One of the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol, which I established in 2002 to make evidenced based recommendations to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm, concerns limiting the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol advertising. The Cabinet has approved a draft general scheme for an Alcohol Products Bill for the control of advertising, sponsorship and sales promotions-marketing practices.

I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the North Western Health Board, NWHB, area and on a national basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3294">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service.

Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3295">Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on the 1 of December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</p>
            <p eId="para_3296">Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698m was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. The NWHB was allocated an additional €273,000 in 2001 for orthodontic services of which €178,000 was for the orthodontic initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_3297">In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the Treatment Purchase Fund towards the treatment of persons on the orthodontic waiting lists; the NWHB received €285,000 from this fund.

            <p eId="para_3299">Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed my Department that at the end of the March quarter 2004, there were 21,033 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are nearly twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated and almost 4,000 extra children are getting treatment from health boards-authority since the end of 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_3301">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. For those who do not qualify for a medical card there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication, including the long-term illness scheme and the drug payments scheme. Many allowances such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that any person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</p>
            <p eId="para_3302">It is open to all persons to apply to the CEO of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</p>
            <p eId="para_3303">There is no short-term plan to extend medical card income guidelines other than as provided for by the annual CPI index increase. The last such increase was notified in January 2004. However, in line with the health strategy entitled Quality and Fairness — A Health System For You, the possibility of extending medical card entitlement by statute to various groups is under ongoing review in my Department in the context of the strategy's second goal which is fair access. As the Deputy is aware the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_3304">The health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and, proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3305">In addition, my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the whole legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services.</p>

            <p eId="para_3316">The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_3317">Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3318">Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States public health service, and the United States surgeon general.</p>
            <p eId="para_3319">As the Deputy is aware, I established the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland; its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_3320">The Forum on Fluoridation made several recommendations concerning the continued use of fluoride technology in this country; re-defining the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water was one of its recommendations. This recommendation was made against a background of exposure to multiple sources of fluoride and changes in the rates of dental decay and dental fluorosis on both a population and individual level; it is part of a long-term strategy to reduce levels of mild dental fluorosis in children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3321">In all, the report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. The expert body, that was recommended by the forum, has been established; one of its terms of reference is to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Forum on Fluoridation — including that referred to by the Deputy. In addition, the expert body will advise me and evaluate ongoing research — including new emerging issues — on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required, and report to me on matters of concern at my request or on own initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_3322">The expert body has broad representation, including from the areas of public health medicine, engineering, management, environmental protection, environmental health, dentistry, and health promotion. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the body will have a strong consumer input in terms of members of the public and representatives of consumer interests, in addition to the necessary scientific, managerial and public health inputs.</p>

            <p eId="para_3324">As the Deputy is aware, I established the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum report's main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The forum also concluded that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly. The best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at 1 part per million, human health is not adversely affected. Dental fluorosis — a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel — is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3325">In all the report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation.

            <p eId="para_3333">The programme for Government provides for the continued support of the six regional airports and my Department provides a range of financial mechanisms in support of this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">Knock Airport benefits considerably through a range of direct and indirect support mechanisms, namely, capital grant assistance towards essential infrastructural improvements under the BMW regional operational programme of the NDP, the allocation of assistance towards marketing, safety and security related expenditure incurred by the airport and scheduled flights supported by the PSO programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3335">Under the NDP capital measure, my Department has provided €2.337 million in grant aid towards essential infrastructural improvements at the airport since December 2001. The primary purpose of the NDP measure is to provide grant assistance to facilitate the continued safe and viable operations at the airport. A further round of projects under the measure is currently being considered for funding by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3336">With regard to capital investment at the three State airports, I should point out that investment in infrastructure at Dublin, Shannon and Cork is funded by Aer Rianta from its own resources and financing arrangements. Non-recourse to the Exchequer will continue following the restructuring of Aer Rianta.</p>
            <p eId="para_3337">Scheduled air services linking Knock Airport with Dublin are subsidised through the public service obligation, PSO, programme. Aviation and passenger handling charges applied by Knock Airport for handling PSO flights represent a significant proportion of total operating income for the airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3338">The airport also receives approximately €400,000 from my Department each year towards marketing, safety and security related expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_3339">I am aware that, under the guidance of the new management team, the airport has enjoyed some success in recent years and I am encouraged to see the growth in passenger numbers, particularly on new non-subsidised services to the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">In recognition of the role that the airport can play in stimulating more balanced economic development for the north west, my Department will continue to assist Knock Airport as it develops into the future. However, any financial assistance would have to be carefully evaluated in line with the general scale of operations at the airport and wider transport and aviation policy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3342">I set out my policy proposals for public transport reform in statements to the Public Transport Partnership Forum in November 2002 and the Oireachtas Committee on Transport in June 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_3343">My objectives in proposing reform of the 70 year old legislation which regulates the public transport sector are: to use competition in the provision of bus services to stimulate better performance, improved efficiency and cost effectiveness; to ensure that the taxpayer and the public transport user get better value for money; and, to show clearly how funding for public transport is being spent to deliver service, and to establish a clear link between payments and performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3344">The principal elements of my proposals are: the establishment of an independent procurement and regulatory authority for transport, on a national basis; and, the introduction of controlled competition into the bus market in the Dublin area in the form of franchising as the primary means of procuring bus services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">I am firmly of the view that creating genuine opportunities for other bus companies to enter the bus market in Dublin is in the best interests of both the taxpayer and the customers of public transport. I am also firmly of the view that these opportunities can be created without adversely impacting on the pay and conditions of existing Dublin Bus employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_3346">Officials of my Department have held a number of meetings with the CIE unions since February this year. On 12 May my Department put detailed proposals on reform of the bus market in Dublin to the CIE unions. On 18 May the CIE unions presented a substantive response paper through the independent chair. This paper included proposals which would have significant implications for the industrial relations structure of the bus industry, and which in turn would have potentially significant ramifications for the wider economy and the general approach to industrial relations in this country. When the discussions resumed on 8 June, my officials gave an initial response to the union paper but advised the unions that, given the implications of these proposals, there was a need for detailed consultations with other Departments and for the issue to be discussed at Cabinet. Unfortunately, despite this need to consider the proposals more fully, the NBRU decided to ballot on industrial action.</p>
            <p eId="para_3347">I regret the recent announcement by the NBRU that it plans to go ahead with industrial action which will seriously inconvenience the travelling public, have negative impacts on business and tourism and damage the reputation of public transport as a viable alternative to private car commuting.</p>
            <p eId="para_3348">There is no need for this industrial action. The talks, under the skilled chairmanship of Kevin Foley, have been making progress. There has been real engagement in identifying and solving the core issues. I remain personally committed to the current talks process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3349">As regards the bus licensing issue, my Department issued two licences in early June to enable the provision of morning and evening services for workers in the Citywest Business Park. In processing the licence applications, my Department followed its normal procedure which included an assessment of the public interest as narrowly defined by the Road Transport Act 1932. During the course of its assessment my Department was advised by Citywest that Dublin Bus had first been requested to provide services into the business campus, but the company did not take up the request. The background to this licensing decision has been fully explained to the trade unions. I have repeatedly made it clear that the Road Transport Act 1932 no longer provides a satisfactory basis for regulating the bus market and that I plan to replace it as part of my regulatory reform programme. The sooner we find a basis in the talks process for moving forward in the reform programme, the sooner the 1932 Act will be replaced.</p>

            <p eId="para_3353">Last October, I approved a proposal from Aer Lingus to upgrade and standardise its European fleet. This will see the airline transition to a single short-fleet aircraft for its European operations with the acquisition of 17 Airbus A320 aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_3354">The new aircraft will be on stream by 2005, maintaining the short-haul fleet at 27 but with increased capacity and operational flexibility arising from the larger aircraft and lower unit costs. The overall transaction involves the sale of some existing aircraft. I should point out that this investment is being funded from internal resources within the company with no recourse to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3355">In addition, the company has commenced a review of its long-haul fleet which is expected to be completed by autumn 2004. It would be unwise for me to speculate on the outcome of that review at this stage. However, early indications are that the company will need access to equity to fund the investment.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</from>
            <p eId="para_3361">As required by EU law, testing of certain passenger cars has been mandatory in Ireland since January 2000. The National Car Testing Service Limited holds a ten year contract to carry out testing on behalf of the State. The company was awarded the contract following an international public tendering competition, which was conducted in accordance with EU procurement law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3362">The contract for the operation of the national car test, NCT, requires National Car Testing Service Limited, NCTS, to meet a range of performance standards for the service. These cover customer service, premises, test equipment, staff, test arrangements, facilities management and management information technology. The performance standards are designed to ensure test integrity and consistency across the testing network together with a high level of customer service. The contract provides for penalties, including financial penalties, and for the termination of the contract in certain circumstances for failure to carry out the service in accordance with the performance standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3363">My Department monitors all aspects of the operation of the NCTS to ensure that it delivers the car testing service to the required standards. To assist the Department in this function a supervision services contractor, a consortium involving the Automobile Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers with engineering, financial, legal, IT and operational expertise, has been engaged and is working to an agreed programme for the Department. This programme includes detailed monthly operational audits of the company's performance; quarterly controlled checks to ensure that consistent test results are obtained across the NCTS test centre network; each month reviewing the performance of a sample of vehicle inspectors as they carry out tests; carrying out spot checks without any advance warning on a representative sample of cars that have just undergone the NCT; carrying out detailed interviews with a representative sample of customers to assess customer satisfaction levels; and a comprehensive annual review of the company's overall performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3364">The test integrity measures are in place to ensure testing is carried out to the necessary standards across the network. As a consequence customers can be confident that there are no variations in the standards of the test no matter where it is conducted on the network. Because of these safeguards, test outcomes represent the actual condition of vehicles presented for test. Results for 2003 show a pass rate of 52% for first tests and 90% on retest.</p>
            <p eId="para_3365">Since 2000 when car testing commenced the customer satisfaction rating for NCTS has at all times been above the contract standard and the satisfaction rating has improved year-on-year. The customer satisfaction rating was determined using proven and reliable scientific methods for such purposes and involved telephone interviews and structured interviews of representative samples of the customers. The high level of customer satisfaction is also borne out by the small number of complaints received by the company in relation to the service. In an operation involving 631,257 full tests and 303,320 retests in 2003 complaints arose in relation to 0.10% of the vehicles tested.</p>

            <p eId="para_3367">The Irish Airlines General Employees Superannuation Scheme, IAS scheme, is a multi-employer pension scheme which provides pensions for, <i> inter alia</i>, most Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta employees. Aer Rianta’s current and past employees comprise a minority of the membership of this scheme. The most recent actuarial valuation of the IAS scheme, March 2003, indicates,<i> inter alia</i>, that the fund is in surplus and that the actuary is able to provide the minimum funding standard certificate as required by the 1990 Pensions Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3368">I should make it clear that pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus, are matters primarily for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the company or companies involved. The State has no involvement in the funding of these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">In relation to the Irish airlines scheme, I understand that the employers, including Aer Rianta, have been meeting all of their liabilities towards the pension fund in accordance with the rules of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">The State Airports Bill 2004 which will give effect to the restructuring of Aer Rianta contains general provisions in relation to pensions and enables the new Cork and Shannon Airport authorities either to adhere to the current IAS pension scheme or establish a new scheme, subject to ministerial consent. This will enable each of the new airport authorities to join the existing pension scheme or, if they wish, to prepare a scheme for the granting of superannuation benefits to or in respect of employees of those authorities. In the latter case, each authority can establish schemes for its own employees or establish schemes in conjunction with the other airport authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3372">The Road (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 give local authorities the power to apply a range of parking controls on vehicles, including the imposition of a prohibition on the parking of large vehicles. Article 38 of these regulations provides that where the appropriate traffic sign is provided at the entrance to a road or an area, a vehicle whose unladen weight exceeds the weight specified on the information plate that accompanied the sign, is prohibited from being parked in that area. At the end of the prohibition on such parking in an area a traffic sign accompanied by an information plate containing a symbol of a large vehicle and the word END-CRÍOCH is provided. The restriction on such parking does not apply where it is necessary to park the large vehicle while goods are being loaded in or on to it or unloaded from it for a period not exceeding 30 minutes from the commencement of the parking.</p>
            <p eId="para_3373">The application of prohibitions provided for in article 38 and the determination of the weight-based threshold is a matter for each local authority and my Department does not compile statistics in relation to the exercise of such functions.

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3379">I can confirm that my Department awarded an annual passenger licence on 28 April 2004 to a private operator under the Road Transport Act 1932 to provide express bus services between Dundalk, Drogheda and Dublin via the M1 motorway.</p>
            <p eId="para_3380">My Department is required under section 11(3)(<i>a</i>) of the 1932 Act to apply a public interest test to applications for licences. It must consider whether the service proposed is in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3381">My Department concluded following a thorough examination, that it was in the public interest to grant the application. The critical considerations which led to this decision were: the large scale residential and other developments along this route over the past five years; the consequential growth in the level of commuter traffic; the absence of an express bus service from the main population centres involved; the significant overcrowding at peak commuter times observed on Iarnrod Éireann services, particularly from Drogheda; the deferral of the introduction of additional bus services between Drogheda and Dublin by Bus Éireann which were authorised by my Department on 21 October, 2003; and, the absence of any other prior proposal for an express service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3382">It is not correct that Bus Éireann were not given the necessary permissions to compete on the route. The company submitted a proposal to my Department for an express service along the M motorway between Dundalk and Dublin on 1 March, 2004, namely five months after the private operator submitted his application.</p>
            <p eId="para_3383">On 29 April 2004, the day after a licence was awarded to the private operator, my Department, in accordance with its first come, first served policy, sanctioned the introduction of approximately half the services proposed by Bus Éireann along the M1 motorway. The remaining services were judged to be in direct competition with the private licensed operator. Section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 precludes the CIE companies from initiating or altering road passenger services so as to compete with a service licensed under the 1932 Act. Bus Éireann were therefore advised that it was open to them to seek my consent under section 25 so as to compete with the private operator at the times in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_3384">An application from Bus Éireann under section 25 was duly received by my Department on 29 June, 2004 and this application is under active consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_3385">My Department operates due process and fair procedure in the administration of the bus licensing and authorisation system. Bus Éireann has the same opportunity as private operators to propose the introduction of additional or new services to meet growing customer demand from commuters into Dublin. In this particular case, a private operator identified the need for a service which would utilise the new M1 motorway and was first to apply to my Department with a proposal to operate a service. The operator was duly awarded a licence following due consideration by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3422">The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the outturn costs of individual road projects, is a matter for the National Roads Authority and the local authorities concerned. The NDP mid-term target of 30% completion of the major inter-urban routes by the end of 2003 was largely met with 29% of the programme completed on schedule. In relation to the national roads programme overall, it should be noted that since 2000 a total of 41 projects, over 277 kms, have been completed. Work is in progress on 18 projects, 199 kms, and another 12 projects, 88 kms, are at tender stage. The estimated cost of delivering the programme was €16.4 million at end 2003 prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3423">I understand from the NRA that the current position in relation to the upgrading of the five major inter-urban routes to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard is that the M1 is expected to be fully complete by end 2006. Work is underway on major projects on the N7 — Monasterevin by-pass, which is expected to be opened later this year, on the N8 — Cashel by-pass and the Fermoy by-pass on the N4-N6 — Kilcock-Kinnegad, and the N1 Dundalk Western by-pass. Work is expected to start this year on Dundalk to Newry on the M1, the Waterford city by-pass and the Naas Road widening. Completion of these projects will eliminate many of the major bottlenecks on these routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3424">In addition, it is expected that compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact statements for the remaining projects in planning on these routes will either be approved by, or be before, An Bord Pleanála by end 2004.</p>

As part of this process there is extensive consultation with environmental and heritage authorities and interests in order to avoid or reduce negative impacts. Major projects are also subject to comprehensive environmental impact assessment in accordance with the Roads Act 1993, which requires environmental impact statements on major road projects to be submitted to An Bord Pleanála for approval.</p>

            <p eId="para_3474">A total of €4.881 million, including VAT, has been spent since 1997 on the supply, installation and commissioning of CCTV systems in the following areas: Dublin North Central; Dublin South Central; Tralee, Cork City, Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. Provision has been made in the Garda Vote for 2004 for expenditure of up to €4.494 million on CCTV systems. This provision will cover existing financial commitments for the CCTV systems in Cork city, Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. Work is underway in restructuring the tender process for the next phase of Garda CCTV schemes in Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_3475">The value of Garda CCTV systems is principally as an aid to existing Garda resources. CCTV systems must, therefore, be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures. They are not, nor are they intended to be, a replacement for gardaí on patrol. The Garda Síochána is strongly of the view that CCTV has a significant role to play in detecting crime and that it is also an important factor in crime prevention, through the fear of being caught on camera. The siting and visibility of CCTV cameras can act as an overt deterrent to criminals. The systems have also been of proven assistance to gardaí in the identification of suspects, in facilitating a more efficient use of Garda resources and the better management of incidents. Anecdotally, experience both here and in other jurisdictions with CCTV as a crime prevention and detection aid has been very positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3476">To date, the Irish experience is that CCTV systems have been greatly welcomed by local communities in that they help to create a safer environment in which people can go about their daily business in the knowledge that persons are less likely to commit offences in the presence of the cameras. There is still a huge demand from communities all around the country for CCTV. The Garda research unit carried out an internal evaluation of CCTV systems in Dublin and Tralee in 1999. While the evaluation identified potential benefits of CCTV, such as reduced crime and disorder, increased detections, improved public feelings of safety, more effective deployment of police resources and improved court processing — guilty pleas — the evidence was not conclusive. This was mainly due to methodological difficulties such as data limitations and difficulty in isolating CCTV effects from other influences.</p>
            <p eId="para_3477">The Garda research unit is currently evaluating CCTV in three locations — Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire and Galway-Salthill. The main focus of the evaluation is on crime and detection levels before and after camera installation. Crime and detection levels are also being examined in two control areas — Drogheda and Blackrock — to assess general trends and possible crime displacement. The CCTV systems were installed in Dundalk and Dún Laoghaire at the end of 2003 and early 2004. Research findings will not be available for some time, since the evaluation involves comparison of data for 12 month periods before and after camera installation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3478">The Garda annual policing plan 2003 provided for an assessment of the proactive use of CCTV systems as a means of gathering criminal intelligence. The Garda annual policing plan 2004 has also committed the research unit to carrying out a review of the cost and benefit of extending the CCTV system to all urban areas with over 7,000 people. Both projects are expected to be completed later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3480">No level of illegal drug consumption in a prison setting is acceptable to me or to the prison authorities. It is my intention and that of the Irish Prison Service, in line with the commitments in the programme for Government, to take all necessary measures to eliminate drug misuse among prisoners. This is being pursued by way of measures to reduce both the supply and demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population. In particular, the programme for Government commits me to creating a drug-free prison service, with mandatory drug testing of prisoners. A new set of prison rules, which will make provision for such testing, is at an advanced stage of drafting in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Mandatory drug testing can play an important role in the overall strategy for tackling the scourge of heroin use among prisoners. In the meantime, a number of measures are being implemented to curtail the supply of drugs into prisons, including video surveillance, improved visiting-searching facilities and increased vigilance by staff. Netting has been installed over the recreation yards in a number of our closed prisons, to prevent contraband material, such as drugs, being propelled over exterior walls. Future prison designs will seek to locate recreation yards away from perimeter walls as part of further efforts to frustrate the supply of illegal drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3481">Other measures to counter the supply of drugs in prisons include screened visits in Cloverhill and the Midlands Prisons and new visiting arrangements at Mountjoy Prison. Each prisoner at Mountjoy Prison is now required to supply to prison authorities a list of up to six persons who they wish to visit them. Only persons on this list who have been approved by the governor are permitted to visit. In addition, each visitor, prior to being allowed to enter the prison, is now required to present photo identification confirming their identity.</p>
            <p eId="para_3482">Measures to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system include education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders. These programmes and interventions are delivered on an individual and co-ordinated basis by the psychology service, Probation and Welfare Service, prison education service and prison officers. Particular initiatives put in place include drug-free areas, drug misuse awareness programmes, support programmes and appropriate health interventions, substitution therapies, vaccination programmes and treatment for viral illnesses. In addition, the Irish Prison Service provides prisoners with a range of opportunities to encourage them to aspire to a substance-free lifestyle, before and after release, thereby reducing demand for illicit substances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3483">I am currently considering proposals for a new prison drugs policy and examining whether it would be effective in ridding our prisons of drugs. It is my intention to publish the new policy in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_3538">The budget provision in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the Irish Presidency, Vote 19, is €4.1 million. Expenditure to date for the management and operation of the business of the Irish Presidency, including pay and other costs associated with meetings during the six-month period from January to June 2004, is €2.4 million. This is in line with planned expenditure. It is not possible at this stage to give a detailed breakdown of the overall costs of the Irish Presidency in respect of Vote 19 as the maintenance of accounts is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3539">An additional €12.473 million was made available in the Garda Vote to take account of the increased policing and security workload associated with our hosting of the EU Presidency this year. Complete costs in relation to the involvement of the Garda Síochána in EU Presidency-related duties are not available at present. When all expenditure returns have been received and collated, a full costing of the operation will be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_3541">My Department has responsibility for disability equality policy and legislation and has been active in promoting disability awareness. The policy of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities was introduced in June 2000. As a result, responsibility for the provision of services for people with disabilities rests with the mainstream body responsible for providing the service generally. Elements of this question relating to specific services are outside the remit of my Department and should be referred to the relevant Minister with overall responsibility for the service in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_3542">In relation to legislation, the Government intends, as promised in the Agreed Programme for Government, to bring forward a disability Bill which includes provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement. The Bill is being finalised and will be published as soon as the Government has completed its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_3543">In the last number of years, in co-operation with the European Commission, my Department organised the Irish national information day on disability. Each year, a particular theme is chosen for the day. Themes to date have included: Progress Through Partnership — 24 November 1997; Progress Through Employment — 30 November 1998; Building a Future Together — 29 November 1999; Information Technology — Access for All — 27 November 2000. This took place simultaneously in three locations — Dublin, Sligo and Ennis; Design for All — 22 October 2001; "Do they take sugar?" — a television programme, aired on Network 2 on 3 December 2002 at 9 p.m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3544">In 2003, my Department chose to focus the national information day on the public sector. More than 200,000 brochures were distributed to public sector employees to inform and raise awareness of disability issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_3545">The year 2003 was European Year of People with Disabilities. Ireland and our EU partners worked together to create awareness about disability issues among the population at large and, more important, to promote awareness of the right of people with disabilities to equal opportunities and protection against discrimination. My Department designated the National Disability Authority, NDA, as the national co-ordinating body. The NDA chaired the national co-ordinating committee which co-ordinated events for the year in Ireland. The members of the committee represented disability organisations, the social partners, Departments and the media. My Department was represented on the committee which focused on four particular themes for the year — awareness raising; youth and disability; rights, partnership and responsibilities; and employment. The committee supported a wide-ranging programme of projects nation-wide to highlight the aims of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3546">My Department funded other initiatives and events to publicise the year, including the Youth — Beyond Disability seminars, organised by People with Disabilities in Ireland; a calendar, in conjunction with PwDI; and the Design for All exhibition in partnership with the Office of Public Works. My Department continues to be active in promoting disability awareness. A television programme title "Three 60" is currently airing on RTE television on Monday evenings at 7.30 p. m. which has been supported by funding from my Department.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_1044">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3548">I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a total of seven juveniles have been identified in the Store Street area as having multiple charges who are not in custody pending further court appearances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3549">On the question of whether a person charged with a number of offences should be held in custody, I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the decision to grant or refuse bail, or to hold a person in custody, in any particular case is a matter for the courts which are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3550">The Garda authorities have informed me that in 2003 an arrest referral scheme was piloted in the north central division, which includes Store Street. The scheme targets young people at risk and emphasises early intervention to refer young people to the appropriate services. I understand from the Garda authorities that the policy of the Garda Síochána when dealing with juveniles who offend is to consider the offender for inclusion in the Garda juvenile diversion programme. The programme provides that in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The Children Act 2001 placed this programme on a statutory footing and the relevant sections of the Act were commenced in May 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_3551">The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at local level. I am further informed that in 2003 the Garda national juvenile office received 19,915 referrals under the programme for 17,050 individual offenders. The Deputy should note that these figures are provisional and are subject to a validation process. The programme is delivered throughout the country by 85 garda and eight sergeant juvenile liaison officers who are employed full time working with juvenile offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3552">Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the juvenile diversion programme. The restorative justice programme supports the victim by providing an opportunity in certain circumstances to attend a caution of the juvenile offender. The victim may take the opportunity to explain the harm done to him or her and receive an apology. Essentially, the provisions of the Children Act provide for the inclusion, where appropriate and possible, of the victim, the juvenile's family and the wider stakeholding community in the process of diversion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3553">To facilitate these innovative developments, most of the Garda juvenile liaison officers have now received training in mediation skills, with advanced training being provided to selected officers. Since the commencement of the relevant part of the Children Act in May 2002 and up to the end of December 2003, 135 restorative cautions and 12 restorative conferences have been held. Early assessments indicate a very high level of satisfaction from all those involved in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3554">Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research unit. It is intended that as Garda juvenile liaison officers become more skilled in administering restorative justice, they will be able to focus on the more complex and high-risk offenders, with a view to further reducing the incidence of recidivism. To ensure the effective operation of the Garda juvenile diversion programme in accordance with section 44 of the Act, a committee to monitor the effectiveness of the programme, review all aspects of its operation and monitor the ongoing training needs of facilitators involved in restorative conferencing was established in June 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_3555">In addition to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, there are 64 Garda youth diversion projects. These projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved — or further involved — in anti-social or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations. As the Deputy may be aware, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of these projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department. Funding of €5.318 million has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3556">There are three Garda youth diversion projects currently operating in the north inner city: the NICKOL project in the Summerhill-Ballybough area, the DIME project in Hardwicke Street and the HAY project in the North Strand.</p>

            <p eId="para_3558">As I indicated previously to the House, the Office of Public Works identified health and safety issues in Fitzgibbon Street Garda station which require it to be vacated. The Office of Public Works has not yet succeeded in providing any suitable alternative accommodation to facilitate the carrying out of refurbishment works at the station. I understand, however, that the health and safety issues identified continue to be monitored by the Office of Public Works on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3559">The optimum use of Garda stations was considered as part of the major review of the Garda organisation structures under the strategic management initiative programme of modernisation which looked in detail at a range of areas within the organisation. The final report of the Garda SMI implementation group, which is available on my Department's website, does not refer to the closure of any specific Garda station, but rather makes recommendations to assist policy-making with regard to the management and use of all available resources, including Garda stations.</p>

While it is a matter for individual local authorities to decide on the allocation of houses to single persons and other categories on their waiting lists in accordance with their schemes of letting priorities, my Department continues to advise local authorities of the need to provide a reasonable mix of dwellings suited to the different kinds of households already on waiting lists and to plan their future programmes taking account of the estimated size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4835">Local authorities have been asked to submit action plans setting out their social and affordable housing programmes for the period 2004 to 2008. Most authorities have submitted these plans in draft form to my Department. I consider that given the nature of continuous housing need, the preparation of these action plans will be beneficial to local authorities in identifying priority needs over the coming years and providing a coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services, including delivery of housing by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. My Department will be examining individual plans to ensure that they match the profile of need in local authority areas. It is intended to agree activity levels with each local authority in the autumn of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4839">In accordance with normal practice, the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing, published on 4 March 2004, were issued in draft form to give all those interested an opportunity to comment before the guidelines were finalised in statutory form. Submissions on the draft guidelines were to be submitted to my Department by 30 April 2004. A total of 105 submissions on the draft guidelines have been received by my Department from interested organisations and individuals. The submissions are currently being examined in detail by my Department. I intend to consider carefully any suggestions for clarifying or improving the guidelines before they are finalised. I expect the guidelines will be issued in their final statutory form before the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4840">However, in view of the importance of the rural housing issue and the fact that there has already been extensive opportunity for public debate, I have requested planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to the draft guidelines with effect from their date of publication. The guidelines are a material consideration for development plans and in the consideration of planning applications. Planning authorities are required to review and vary their development plans, where necessary, to ensure that their policies on rural settlement are consistent with the policies set out in the guidelines.</p>

            <p eId="para_4844">The administration of the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes, including the processing of individual applications, is a matter for local authorities. The framework for the operation of the schemes is laid down in statutory regulations and, as far as practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities. The increases to the grant and recoupment levels and to the proportion of the cost of approved work payable, which were introduced by my Department over the past few years, have led to a significant increase in activity under the schemes. To meet this demand the funding provided by Government has enabled expenditure to increase from €13 million in 1998 to €65 million this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4845">I am anxious to ensure that the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes are operated by local authorities in the most efficient, cost effective and user-friendly manner possible. It is obvious that local authorities have recently become more conscious of the need to manage the schemes to ensure the available funding is directed towards those most in need of assistance, having regard to the priorities in their own areas. Management of the schemes is also necessary to ensure that authorities remain within their capital allocation and do not put undue pressure on their own revenue accounts, from which they provide one third of the available funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_4846">My Department monitors activity on the schemes through the compilation of statistical information on the level of applications received and approved by and in the hands of local authorities. Expenditure and recoupment levels are also monitored, as are emerging trends in the operation of the schemes. In addition, discussions take place between my Department and local authorities throughout the year at official level in the context of the annual financial allocations.</p>

     if he will report on the implementation of the EC directive on packaging and packaging waste, in particular the enforcement of the new phase from 2004 to 2008.

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_1060">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_4852">Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at the end of their lives. Under the directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005, with a minimum of 25% to be achieved by recycling, including a minimum 15% recycling rate for each type of packaging material. In accordance with this approach, a producer responsibility initiative operates in Ireland in the area of recovery of packaging waste and is underpinned by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003 which replaced earlier regulations introduced in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_4853">Under the regulations, producers are required to take steps individually to recover their packaging waste — this is known as self-compliance — or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste. Repak Limited was established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste and is the only such approved compliance scheme in Ireland. Repak has reported consistent progress since 1997 and in 2001 met the 25% packaging waste recovery target required by the directive. The latest indications are that Ireland is on course to meet the higher recovery and recycling targets for the end of 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4854">Enforcement of the packaging regulations is primarily a matter for local authorities. In this regard, I have allocated €7 million to local authorities from the environment fund in 2004 for stepped-up enforcement of waste management legislation generally. Local authorities have been requested to give particular priority to enforcement of the new packaging regulations in their functional areas. In this context, the network of enforcement officers from the major urban local authorities — which was established by my Department in late 2001 to step up enforcement of the packaging regulations — has now been extended nationwide to all local authorities. Furthermore, the Office of Environmental Enforcement was recently established within the Environmental Protection Agency to improve the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation generally. Local authorities are obliged to report to the EPA on their enforcement activities and where a local authority's performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory, the EPA can take appropriate remedial action on the matter, including as a last resort prosecuting relevant local authorities for failing to discharge their enforcement obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4855">The 1994 packaging directive has recently been revised by a new amending directive which specifies higher recovery and recycling targets to be achieved by 2011 in the case of Ireland and 2008 for most other member states. The main revisions to the 1994 directive are an increase in the packaging waste recovery target to 60% and in the packaging waste recycling target to 55%, with the material-specific recycling targets for glass, 60%, paper and board, 60%, metals, 50%, plastics, 22.5%, and wood, 15%. In this regard, my Department is in discussions with Repak with a view to developing an effective strategy which will facilitate the achievement by Ireland of the new higher recovery and recycling targets over the period 2006 to 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_4876">The compilation and publication of the register is a matter for each registration authority in accordance with electoral law and involves the carrying out of house-to-house or other local inquiries and in many cases delivering registration forms to households for completion. The draft register is published on 1 November annually and is made available for examination by the public at post offices, public libraries, Garda stations, courthouses and local authority offices up to 25 November. The public are invited, through national and local advertising campaigns, to check the draft during this period to ensure that they are correctly registered and to bring errors or omissions in the draft to the attention of the registration authority. The final register is published on 1 February and comes into force for a year on 15 February. Electoral law also provides for the updating of the register through the supplement facility in the run-up to polls.</p>
            <p eId="para_4877">When removing electors from the register authorities are required, by a ministerial instruction issued under section 18 of the Electoral Act 1992, to send a notice to a person whose name it is proposed to omit from the draft register indicating that they have failed to establish that the person is still resident at the address and unless evidence to the contrary is provided within ten days, his or her name will be removed. In addition, any person may claim to have a correction made to the draft register following its publication. The claim must be made to the registration authority by 25 November and it may include, in particular, a claim to have the name of a person added or deleted. Such claims are ruled on, in public, by the appropriate county registrar and interested parties must be given notice of the time and location of the proposed hearing. An appeal may be made in the Circuit Court on the decision of a county registrar.</p>
            <p eId="para_4878">After the final register comes into force, a person's name can only be removed if he or she has applied successfully for entry on the supplement to the register as a result of a change of residence, which can be within the constituency or to another constituency. In such cases, the person's name on the register in respect of their previous address is deleted and they are registered at their new address.</p>
            <p eId="para_4879">I wish to ensure that the register of electors used at any poll should be as accurate as possible and there have been a number of changes in recent years which have helped to improve its accuracy. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 included new provisions to allow persons who have moved residence to another constituency or to another electoral area in a constituency during the currency of a register or who will reach 18 years of age on or before polling day to apply for entry in the supplement to the register. The Act also provides that persons who are unable to vote in their constituencies because of their employment by a returning officer in another constituency on polling day are eligible to apply for entry in the supplement to the postal voters list. Notwithstanding these reforms of the administrative and legal arrangements for compiling the register of electors, the continued improvement of the register is still an important concern and I intend to monitor its progress closely.</p>

            <p eId="para_4881">Since the introduction in 1996 of a revised boundary alteration code under the Local Government Act 1991, applications from a number of local authorities to alter their administrative boundaries have been determined and implemented and these are listed in the following table. Further details of these boundary extensions are set out in the relevant statutory instruments, which are cited in the table.</p>
            <p eId="para_4882">In only one case was an application not determined and the applicant local authority, Limerick City Council, was advised to develop a revised proposal on the basis of updated data. I intend to bring into effect later this year new arrangements regarding local authority boundary alterations based on provisions in the Local Government Act 2001 which will replace those of the 1991 Act.</p>

General purpose grants are a contribution towards the day-to-day costs of running local authority services, including compilation of the register of electors.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4996">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, SWA, is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their basic needs and those of their dependants. Its primary purpose is to ensure that every person in the state has sufficient resources to meet their basic needs. In assessing a person's means for the purpose of SWA, including the rent supplement aspect of the scheme, the legislation provides that all income both in cash and in kind is taken into account. While income derived from certain sources can be disregarded, applicants for SWA are generally expected to use their own income or capital, if they have any, to meet their basic needs in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4997">The method of assessment to which the Deputy refers relates to the assessment of capital such as savings or the value of property other than the applicant's home. For the purpose of the means test, capital is assessed using the following formula: 5% of the first €507.90 plus 10% of the balance above €507.90. This is then divided by 52 to give the weekly value of the means. A single person with capital of €70,000 will qualify for SWA at a reduced rate, while a person with dependants will still qualify even if they have substantially higher amounts of capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_4998">I am aware that interest rate paid to depositors is low at present. However, the purpose of the formula is to assess capital value rather than the interest accruing to an individual. Any changes in the means assessment criteria for receipt of supplementary welfare allowance would have to be considered in a budgetary context. In this regard I am satisfied that the formula is reasonable and I have no immediate plans to alter it.</p>

            <p eId="para_5000">The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The scheme is not intended to be a long-term solution in any individual case and it was never intended to be an ongoing source of funding for crèches. The appropriate necessary services need to be funded directly in a sustainable and appropriate manner. The crèche supplement was introduced with the intention of providing assistance to a parent in need of short-term emergency support. This could arise, for example, where a parent would not be able to avail of necessary supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes without assistance with child minding.</p>
            <p eId="para_5001">The fact that supplements were in payment for long durations in many cases indicates that they had become a long-term child care support rather than the short-term social welfare intervention which was originally intended. In effect, long-term child care needs were being provided through a short-term emergency provision scheme. This is not an appropriate way to meet the needs of the people in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_5002">Discussions are continuing with officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and health board representatives to ensure a more co-ordinated approach to the provision of crèche and pre-school supports. As an interim measure, crèche supplements in payment prior to 1 January 2004 are being allowed to continue. The changes I introduced in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme do not affect the discretion available to health boards to provide assistance in emergency cases which may arise from time to time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5004">Lone parents or others who take up a community employment place are not automatically disqualified from receiving rent supplement if the household income exceeds the €317.43 limit referred to by the Deputy. Any participant in community employment has the option of being assessed for rent supplement under the standard supplementary welfare allowance means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_5005">Under standard assessment rules, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. Up to €50 in respect of additional income from part-time employment is disregarded in the means test, thus ensuring that a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. Community employment is regarded as part-time employment for these purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5006">The amount of rent supplement payable in any given case depends on the particular circumstances of the individual concerned. In most cases, a lone parent with one child living in the Dublin area and participating in a CE scheme would receive €85.90 per week in rent supplement. He or she would have an income of €188.60 per week after paying rent and would be €50 per week better off than a lone parent in similar circumstances who was not participating in a CE scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5007">The limit to which the Deputy refers applies to people in full-time employment. Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people who are engaged in full-time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for a number of years which allow people to retain a portion of their rent supplement where they take up employment through approved schemes, such as community employment, subject to a weekly household income limit of €317.43. While the €317.43 income limit applicable in these cases has remained static, other improvements have been made. The period for which rent supplement may be retained has been extended to four years on a tapered basis, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. In addition, the upper limit of €317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable was abolished for people on the approved schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5008">Furthermore, back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are now disregarded in the assessment of the €317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test. I am aware that the €317.43 income limit affects lone parents who participate in community employment schemes. This is due to the fact they receive one-parent family payment in addition to receiving the appropriate community employment wage. To facilitate people in this position, participants in CE schemes may opt for assessment under the standard SWA means test or under the special means test described above, whichever is the more favourable to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_5009">Rather than acting as a disincentive to work or training, the arrangements I have outlined are designed to encourage and assist people in the transition from reliance on welfare payments to full-time employment. Any further changes in the qualification criteria for receipt of rent supplement will be considered as part of the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme currently under way in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_5012">The Midland Health Board was contacted regarding this case and has advised that the person concerned was refused basic supplementary welfare allowance on the basis that he does not satisfy the habitual residency condition. He has been advised of his right to appeal against this decision to the health board appeals officer.</p>

            <p eId="para_5014">Recognising the adverse impact that abuse of the social welfare system can have, my Department has a broad-ranging and comprehensive control strategy which aims to keep fraud and abuse to an absolute minimum. This includes checks at point of claiming, verification that the conditions for entitlement continue to be met, review of means for those in receipt of a non-contributory social assistance payment, arrangements for debt recovery and prosecution of offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_5015">Furthermore, the Criminal Assets Bureau, which was set up under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, has been operating since October 1996 and comprises of members of the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners and officials of my own Department. Section 5 of the 1996 Act, which deals with the function of the bureau, empowers bureau officers to investigate and determine as appropriate under the Social Welfare Acts any claim in respect of benefit, within the meaning of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1993, by any person engaged in criminal activity. The bureau has already recorded considerable success in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5016">In line with my Department's control strategy, the Department's control division accepts details of possible fraud offered by members of the public in relation to my Department's schemes. Such information may be conveyed by way of written complaint, telephone, e-mail or personal representation. Such reports can also be made to any of my Department's offices and persons reporting such abuses who wish to remain anonymous are facilitated in this regard.</p>

      asked the

     if there are persons in the Dublin 1 and 3 districts, evicted by Dublin City Council during the past 12 months for anti-social drug related activities, who have subsequently been granted rent supplements for private rented accommodation in the same districts; if there is liaison with Dublin City Council on this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5018">Subject to certain conditions, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs and who do not have accommodation available from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_5019">Where a local authority tenant is evicted for anti-social behaviour the health board normally liaises with the local authority to assess the most suitable solution to address the person's accommodation needs. Local authority tenants who have been evicted for anti-social behaviour are not ordinarily able to obtain rent supplement from the health board. However, the legislation governing the payment of rent supplement provides the health board with discretion to deal with exceptional cases. Having considered the circumstances of each individual case, a health board may provide assistance where, in the opinion of the board, the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.</p>
            <p eId="para_5020">Dublin City Council was contacted on this matter and it has confirmed that liaison arrangements are in place between the council and the health board for dealing with such cases.</p>
