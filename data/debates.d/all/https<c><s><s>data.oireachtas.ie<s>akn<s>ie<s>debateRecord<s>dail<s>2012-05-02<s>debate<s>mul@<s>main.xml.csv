#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	0	As the Taoiseach is aware, a transformation has occurred in the treatment of cancer in the past decade, with outcomes and survival rates improving.  Skin cancer is very common in Ireland because the majority of people have fair skin.  Over 1,200 people were diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2008 alone.  Fortunately, the majority of skin cancers are treatable, but metastatic melanoma is one of the deadliest forms and more common among younger people.  The latest drug - Ipi or Ipiluminab - is highly successful in treating this type of melanoma.  It is the most significant breakthrough drug to be produced in 30 years for the treatment of serious skin cancers and has been classified as twice as effective as the nearest competitor drug.  Nevertheless, it is not being provided or funded by the Minister or the Department of Health.  This is despite the fact that the National Cancer Control Programme recommended to the HSE in January that the drug be made available.  It has been approved by the European drugs agency.  Irish clinicians have confirmed that the delay is having devastating consequences for Irish patients with advanced melanoma.  There are at least 16 patients awaiting the drug treatment, some of whom have articulated their frustration, despair and disbelief on Joe Duffy's "Liveline" programme that the health service is denying access to the drug.  The treatment is available in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria and other European countries.  How many patients must die before the Government will sanction use of the drug in the health service?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1	A number of friends and acquaintances of mine have died during the years from melanoma, an horrific ailment to contract.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Jame Reilly, is in negotiations with the drugs companies on a range of new drugs deemed either to be preventive or life-saving across a broad spectrum.  There is a process to be followed in releasing drugs to the market.  Ipiluminab is on release in the United Kingdom on trial, but was refused in Australia.  The cost estimate per person is approximately €85,000.  I have spoken to the Minister as the matter was raised previously and he is confident of securing a conclusion to the negotiations in the not too distant future.  On the consequences of treating persons with the drug, the evidence is that for one in ten there is a really good reprieve, depending on circumstances, while in other cases, there is a shorter term reprieve.  I am glad the Deputy has raised the matter and the Minister is well aware of the interest in the drug and the consequences of its use.  There is an issue of the cost involved and the Minister is negotiating with the relevant companies.  I understand a conclusion will be reached quickly, allowing the drug to be released to the market.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I do not entirely accept the veracity of the Taoiseach's reply.  One of the country's great strengths was its facilitation of breakthrough drugs, particularly in oncology and cardiology.  We are known for having this strength because breakthrough drugs become commonplace in time.  The European drugs agency approved this treatment across Europe last July and the drug is available in the United Kingdom and Holland, the home of the universal health insurance scheme which the Taoiseach has lauded.  Patients have been denied access to it for too long.Through the National Cancer Control Programme we have radically changed the provision of advanced cancer care.  Access to breakthrough drugs, even in clinical trials, forms a critical part of that approach in seeking better outcomes and survival rates.  Senator John Crown, a cancer specialist, is on record confirming the efficacy of this treatment among his patients.  Will the Taoiseach intervene to ensure the drug is made available and that the policy environment and framework will encourage the use of breakthrough drugs in the proper context?  This is the best way to ensure even better outcomes and survival rates for Irish patients in the weeks, months and years to come.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	It is not that there has been a deliberate hold-up.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, started the national care strategy many years ago when he was responsible for dealing with health matters.  Ireland has always been to the fore in the use of breakthrough drugs.  The drug is available at other locations, but one does not qualify for reimbursement of the cost.  The intention is to have the drug released and the cost reimbursed here.  It is also important to note that there are different classes and categories of other drugs available, of which the Deputy is aware.  There is a process to be adhered to and that is happening.  There are discussions taking place between the Minister for Health and the agency involved.  The intention is to release the drug for reimbursement and to conclude that as quickly as possible.  I am aware of the interest expressed in it by people throughout the country, especially those who have had loved ones suffer as a consequence of this disease, and we want it clearly understood this country will continue to be at the forefront in the use of breakthrough drugs, but a process must be gone through.  For those who prescribe this drug at the end of the day, it is important, given the cost structure outlined, to negotiate to get the best result for the patients who will use it.

An gcuimhin leis an Taoiseach an toghchán agus an five point plan a bhí aige?  Dúirt sé go bhfeidhmeodh a Rialtas ar dhóigh dhifriúil agus go mbeadh difríocht mhór idir Fine Gael-Páirtí an Lucht Oibre agus Fianna Fáil.  Dúirt sé go mbeadh sé macánta le saoránaigh.The Government's austerity programme is causing huge hardship.  It is clear austerity is not working with 500,000 people unemployed, tens of thousands emigrating and families struggling to pay bills.  Under the programme, this will continue for a three years and there will be another €8.6 billion in cuts and tax increases.  Citizens want to know where this money will come from.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Tá a fhios ag an Teachta go maith go bhfuil an tAire Airgeadais ag plé lena chomhghleacaithe san Eoraip ó thaobh athruithe ar an phlean a leag an troika amach agus go bhfuil athrú i gceist ag an troika.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta gur luaigh mé iad seo sa Dáil.The Deputy always speaks of austerity.  Yesterday, he said it was quite bizarre that comments should be made by myself and Deputy Martin in respect of supporting the fiscal stability treaty because of the clear opportunity to keep confidence levels for investment in Ireland high.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is in the United States with Industrial Development Authority officials talking to a range of companies that are considering investing in Europe.  The reason they want to consider Ireland is the package we offer in terms of our tax system, technological capacity, talent and track record in meeting every objective and bar that has been set.  The Deputy has first-hand evidence of that in his town of Dundalk where PayPal decided to add 1,000 jobs.  He found the discussion I had with Deputy Martin and the comments we made quite bizarre.  I do not understand that.Every job created in the country as a result of investment from abroad reduces our deficit by €20,000 and, therefore, the announcement of 1,000 new jobs means a €20 million reduction and 5,000 jobs means a €100 million reduction.  I have made these announcements because of decisions made by investors abroad in the recent past such as PayPal, Apple, Cisco, Eli Lilly, Mylan, Microsoft, HP and so on.  They have made decisions to invest their money in various locations in this country where people will have gainful employment and can make a contribution to their local economy and to their own lives and families.  That is not austerity.We have set out our plan for growth to deal with our budgetary strategy in the years ahead but it is important people understand the reality that a "Yes" vote will lead to confidence and further investment and, as a consequence, more jobs.  That means the deficit will be reduced and it will be easier for Government to plan a way forward between rectifying our public finances, stabilising our debt and growing our economy.  I therefore do not accept the argument put forward by the Deputy at all.  There are good reasons for voting "Yes" to this treaty.  The first is the continuation of the line of investment in Ireland.  The second is the introduction of good housekeeping rules as we get our own house in order and the third is the permanent backstop of the European Stability Mechanism, which will be available to countries that ratify the treaty,Those companies in the US today that are considering investment in Europe want to look at a country that has confidence in itself, the eurozone and the European Union.  That is where we stand, and even if the Deputy's heart is not in this argument, he has first hand evidence in Dundalk that investors have put their money where their mouths are in his constituency and his town. Young men and women will be the gainful beneficiaries of that, and fair play to them.

Like others in the Sinn Féin ranks, we work to try to bring jobs into our constituencies.  The Taoiseach ignored the question.  I asked him how he would pay for this treaty.  The Government has to find €8.6 billion in cuts and taxes.  An additional €6 billion will be needed if the people are tricked or bullied by his Minister for hardship and others into voting "Yes".  The Taoiseach has also failed to tell people that we have to pay €11 billion into the ESM.I found it bizarre to listen to the Taoiseach and Teachta Martin discussing this issue because his party caused the economic collapse.  Teachta Martin cannot even persuade his own party to vote "Yes" so I thought it was bizarre listening to the two of them chatting.

Over the past year we have seen a litany of cases where workers in Jane Norman, La Senza, Lagan Brick, Vita Cortex, Game and Connolly Shoes in my constituency have been treated with despicable contempt by rogue employers.  The latest victim of rogue employers and the Government failure to protect workers are 110 workers in Irish Cement working in counties Limerick and Meath.  These workers have for three decades not been involved in any industrial action but were forced out on strike on 3 April because Irish Cement has refused to pay a Labour Court-recommended set of bonuses to the workers.  This is despite the fact the workers agreed to a rationalisation programme three years ago, cut 33% of their staff and raised productivity by 40%.What is positively disturbing about Irish Cement's failure to pay these workers the money it owes them is that the parent company of Irish Cement is Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, one of the largest building materials companies in the world-----

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Thank you, Deputy.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	67	As the Taoiseach of the country, will he insist those workers are paid and allowed to return to work, where they want to be?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Does the Deputy want us to nationalise it?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	69	You should.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I want Deputy Boyd Barrett to understand that when my party was in opposition, in respect of all the referendums that have been held in regard to Europe, we supported each of these consistently.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	71	They did not do a lot.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	72	In respect of the Lisbon treaty, which was voted on twice by the people of this country, the Fine Gael Party supported that very strongly and took the position of the Government of the day, just as the Fianna Fáil Party, in its political philosophy, supports the eurozone, the euro and the European Union.  I welcome that support and the support from so many other groups and sectoral organisations around the country who see the validity of keeping confidence at a high level and not cutting off a lifeline, should this country ever require it in the future, way beyond the lifetime of this Government or any succeeding Government.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Will the Taoiseach answer the substantive question?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I answered questions on this yesterday.  We in this country have set up a very well tried and tested mechanism for dealing with industrial disputes and their resolution.  While I do not have the details of the Labour Court recommendation in regard to the CRH dispute the Deputy mentions, I would expect that the recommendations made in these cases should be respected.  I am quite sure the Labour Court made its recommendations in the best interests of finding a resolution to this particular problem.The last interaction I had with CRH-----
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Were they in the tent?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	76	-----was in regard to its continued investment in China, where it is doing exceptional work in the north-eastern region.  I undertake to find out the detail of what is involved here.  I would expect that everybody involved would respect the outcome of the industrial relations mechanisms that we have in this country, which were set up for very good reason and which have been tried and tested over the years.  I hope a resolution can be found to this dispute.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Were they at Punchestown last week?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	78	My point was that the Taoiseach shows great urgency and energy when it comes to protecting the interests of bankers, bondholders, financiers and the super-wealthy.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	79	That is the point.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Can he show the same energy, enthusiasm and urgency when it comes to protecting the rights of workers which are being trampled on in a whole series of cases by rogue and unscrupulous employers?  I am asking a very specific question in this case, where we are talking about one of the biggest companies in the State, which has been a huge beneficiary of State support, including a big portion of €220 million in windfall profits from the carbon allocations regime - free profits - and where the CEO was on €2.7 million a year, yet the company will not pay workers moneys owed to them which the Labour Court has recommended should be paid to them.  Those workers have been forced to march around outside those plants for the past three weeks when they want to go back to work.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Thank you, Deputy.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Will the Taoiseach condemn CRH and Irish Cement's failure to do what the Labour Court has recommended and pay these workers the money?  Will he directly contact Irish Cement and CRH and point out to them that they are beneficiaries of State subsidies and, therefore, he is invoking his authority as Taoiseach and demanding that they pay those workers the moneys owed, and show a bit of backbone and urgency when it comes to protecting the workers of this country, whose rights are being trampled on?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Deputy did not display much backbone himself down in Galway when he neither saw nor heard anything.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I did not hear Deputy Boyd Barrett condemn those who spat at security personnel or gardaí or his colleagues who taunted ordinary people going about their democratic business while attending the Ard-Fheis of the Labour Party.  I did not hear Deputy Boyd Barrett condemn them.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	85	What about the cameraman?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Cool down.  Would you mind, please?  Would you please stop?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I enjoin the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' organisations.  They have issued a joint statement on this matter calling for the appointment of an independent chairperson to bring about a resolution.  I am sure the recommendations of the Labour Court can be taken into account when that happens.  I would like to see an end to this dispute and for people to be able to go back to work.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The Taoiseach intervened.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Obviously there are two sides to this story.  The congress and the employers' organisations have issued a joint statement which I support and I hope it can be used to bring about a resolution.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	90	It is proposed to take No. 11, motion re Further Revised Estimates [Vote 37]; No. 18, Education (Amendment) Bill 2012 [Seanad] - Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; and No. 1, Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Bill 2012 [Seanad] - Second Stage (resumed).  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 11 shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith.  Private Members' business shall be No. 33, Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill 2012 – Second Stage (resumed) to conclude at 9 p.m. tonight, if not previously concluded.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	91	There is one proposal to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11, without debate, agreed to?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	92	No, it is not agreed.  The motion is that the Revised Estimates would be taken without debate.  I propose that there should be a debate.  I propose that the Taoiseach should require the Minister for Finance to come to the Dáil and explain his utterly false assertion that a "No" vote in the austerity treaty referendum would lead to even worse cuts in the December budget.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	93	That is a separate issue.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The Taoiseach should ask the Minister or he should take the debate himself and explain why he continually covers up the extent of further drastic cuts and tax increases that his austerity treaty targets would entail.  He should give us clarity rather than threats.  Therefore, we should have a debate.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Before I agree to this being referred to committee for debate, will the Taoiseach clarify that the consequence of this Revised Estimate will be to reclassify PRSI receipts as income tax and, as a consequence, that the Government will be cutting €13 million from the national training fund into which employers pay?  This would have the effect of cutting a fund used to train people.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	96	That is a matter for debate in committee.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I am saying that if this is the case, the Dáil should debate it before it is referred to committee.  It means a cut of €13 million to a national training fund at the very time we need people to be re-trained and when access to training should be available to get them back to work.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The matter was explained in some detail at the committee.  The question of payments being made for income tax and PRSI and the net effect of that was explained in some detail at the committee.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I am putting the question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	100	What about the idle threats of the Minister for Finance?  He is threatening the people with a worse budget, falsely.  Should we discuss that?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I raised an issue earlier in respect of the health services.  My over-riding sense is that there is an absence of any direction in the health services at the moment.  This is principally because the existing governance framework has been arbitrarily disbanded in terms of the HSE board with no alternative put in place.  The situation is unsatisfactory.  Most commentators and observers remark on the fact that we have a directionless health service at the moment.  When will the Health Service Executive governance Bill be published?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	102	It will be taken this session.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	103	On 23 November last, the Taoiseach agreed to meet Opposition leaders to discuss demands for an independent inquiry into sexual abuse allegations in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  At the time the Taoiseach said the meeting would be held before Christmas.  I asked the Taoiseach for this meeting again in January.  Again, the Taoiseach gave a commitment.  I raised the issue in March yet again.  For the third time, the Taoiseach agreed to a meeting but so far no meeting has taken place.  It is six months since the Oireachtas inquiry referendum was defeated.  Last week, I received an answer to a parliamentary question from the Minister, Deputy Reilly, informing me that he is still consulting the Attorney General about the implications.  It has been 17 years since the complaints of sexual abuse of patients at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda were first made.  Every time these issues are raised without being brought to a conclusion the victims are traumatised.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	104	What legislation are you referring to?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	105	When will the Government will take action on this issue?  When will it meet the Opposition on these matters?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Is legislation required?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	107	No legislation is involved.  I will check with the Minister for Health and I will let Deputy Adams know of the progress he has made in this regard.  It is not a case of any reluctance to meet Members.  This is a traumatic and sensitive issue.  I will come back to Deputy Adams.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Will the Taoiseach update the House on when he expects to introduce the mental capacity legislation?  This has been often promised from Governments over the years.  Groups are looking for a definitive timeframe.  Will it be introduced by the end of this year?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The issue raised by Deputy Harris is important.  The mental capacity Bill will be produced in this session.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	110	When will legislation be introduced to change existing social welfare and education legislation relating to the community employment schemes as announced by the Minister, Deputy Burton, earlier?  A review of CE schemes is supposed to take place but it is not happening.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Is legislation required?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	112	No.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill has just been enacted.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	113	That Bill was guillotined.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The citizens of the country will have been scandalised again today to find that top management and executives in banks bailed out and financed by the public-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	115	You have had good run, Deputy.  Will you get to the point?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Vast numbers of them are earning in excess of €100,000 and €200,000 per year.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	117	That is nothing to do with the Order of Business.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	118	We have examined the draft of the fiscal responsibility Bill.  I am surprised there is nothing in it relating to remuneration of the top managers and executives.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	119	We do not debate legislation on the Order of Business.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Are further amendments proposed to the fiscal responsibility Bill?  Will there be another Bill to deal with this matter and to rein in the obscene salaries of top executives and managers in our banks.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Are there amendments to the legislation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	122	No.  That has nothing to do with this legislation.  I have already set down the pay guidelines in respect of the banks and bonuses.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Will the Taoiseach take on board the urgent need for the publication of the criminal justice corruption (consolidation) Bill and give me an exact date for its publication?  The legislation is urgently needed, especially to deal with what has taken place in the past in the political arena.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Can you help Deputy Bannon?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I regret that I cannot give Deputy Bannon an exact date.  Preliminary work on this complex Bill is under way but I cannot give an exact date.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Deputy Bannon can sleep easy tonight.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Will the Taoiseach outline when the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill will be published?  What stage are we at?  Will powers of deposit retention for the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, be included?  This is a major issue of contention that crops up constantly.  I remind the Taoiseach that his Labour colleagues were committed to this previously-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	128	We do not need to remind anybody on the Order of Business.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The residential tenancy Bill will be published in this session.  The Deputy will be entitled to raise those issues and table amendments at that time but the Bill will be taken in this session.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	131	With regard to the Animal Health and Welfare Bill, as the Taoiseach is aware, all Members have received thousands of e-mails about fur farming.  Will the Taoiseach let us know when the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will be debated to give us all an opportunity to contribute?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The Animal Health and Welfare Bill has been published.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I ask the Taoiseach for an assurance that that Bill will be in place before the end of this year.  I am relying on a statement issued recently by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that that legislation was gone for drafting and that it would be enacted by the autumn.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I am aware that he is doing a great deal of work on it.  I will advise the Deputy of the progress made on that and I am conscious that he has said it is important that it be done before the end of the year.

It is an important Bill to do with the reconfiguration of the vocational education committees system and the education system.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Cabinet has signed off on that Bill and when can we expect to see it come before the House?

Amendment No. 4 is in the name of Deputy Crowe.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and may be discussed together.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 4, to delete lines 28 to 39 and in page 5, to delete lines 1 to 22.Section 6 inserts new provisions relating to staff and provides for the following: "The numbers and qualifications of the teachers and other staff of a recognised school, who are, or who are to be, remunerated out of monies provided by the Oireachtas, shall be determined from time to time by the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform".  My amendment proposes to delete this paragraph and substitute it with the following: "The numbers and qualifications of the teachers and other staff of a recognised school, who are to be remunerated out of monies provided by the Oireachtas, shall be determined from time to time by the Minister after consultation with and with the agreement of bodies representative of patrons, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers, or other staff as appropriate and with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform".
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Is the Deputy speaking to the correct amendment?  I understand we are discussing amendments Nos. 4 and 5.  The Deputy appears to be addressing a later amendment.  If it is of any consolation, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 4 which would have the effect of deleting section 5(b).
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I apologise for the confusion.  The amendment relates to the transfer of certain powers from the Department to the Health Service Executive.  Concerns have been raised about this issue, especially by families who are seeking additional supports, many of whom argue that the Health Service Executive is not providing the supports they need.  They are concerned that transferring further responsibility for the provision of supports and services will have a negative effect on their children.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Amendment No. 5 in my name has been grouped with Deputy Seán Crowe's amendment.  Repealing subsections (5) and (6), as inserted by section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, would remove the obligation on and ability of the Minister to request the assistance of the Health Service Executive to provide the relevant support services.  Will the effect of repealing these subsections be to remove all compulsion on statutory agencies to meet the needs of a child who requires particular supports and interventions?  I am concerned that may be the case.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	180	The effect of the amendments would be to delete section 5(b) and maintain the current position which is no longer appropriate.  Section 2 of the Education Act 1998 has been amended to clarify the position that the delivery of health and personal services, including speech therapy, to students of school-going age, is not a support service to be provided by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Subsections (5) and (6) of section 7 of the Education Act which provided for the Minister for Education and Skills to request the assistance of health boards to make provision for such services, therefore, no longer apply.  The legislative framework will be regularised in accordance with the de facto position that the provision of speech therapy services is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  The proposed provisions do not impact on the availability, through the HSE, of speech therapy services for children with special educational needs.  The Department will continue to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs and work with service providers in the health and disability sectors through the interdepartmental cross-sectoral team.On amendment No. 4, I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage which changed part of section 7(4) of the Education Act 1998.  The effect of the amendment is to require the Minister, in carrying out his or her functions under the Act, to have regard to best practice in teaching methods, value for money and quality outcomes for students.  These functions include determining procedures.On the issue of appointments, suspension and dismissal procedures, the Minister is required to consult the education partners, as provided for under section 24(11) which is contained in section 6 of the Bill.  This is a technical provision which states the considerations to which the Minister must have regard in making these and other procedures.  The amendment was made on Committee Stage on the recommendation of the Office of the Attorney General to ensure clarity in respect of considerations required of the Minister when determining procedures.  The effect of Deputy Seán Crowe's amendment would be to undo the change made on Committee Stage and, accordingly, I do not propose to accept it.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	181	There is a lack of clarity as to the effect of the proposed changes.  Speaking in the Seanad in February, the Minister did not provide significant clarification or comfort about the practical effects the changes would have on mainstream and special needs schools.  The change appears to prevent the Department of Education and Skills from providing support services currently provided by the Health Service Executive.  It is not clear what are the services in question or how pupils and schools will be affected.The section appears to be at odds with section 13 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  If the section is not amended, it will become a matter for the National Council for Special Education to make requests of the HSE, under section 39(1) of the 2004 Act, to assist with implementation of particular individual education plans and provision of services which the Department does not provide but which are necessary for such implementation.  The problem is that section 39(3)(c) of the EPSEN Act allows the HSE to refuse such a request on the basis of insufficient resources.  The Act does not impose a positive obligation on it to provide quasi-educational services for children.  Most of the absolute requirements on the executive to act in certain cases are set out in the Child Care Act 1991 and refer to children at risk of abuse or neglect.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to provide clarity on this matter. Given the current shortage of resources, facilitating requests by the National Council for Special Education will present major difficulties for the HSE in many cases.  This gap in the legislation needs to be filled as people are concerned the changes may have a negative impact on children with special educational needs.  Deputies know the hoops families must jump through to secure additional services for such children.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	182	My concern in this regard, one which has been expressed by different groups, is that responsibility for the delivery of services will fall between different agencies.  Deputy Seán Crowe correctly referred to section 13 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 which placed particular obligations on the Minister to provide for the individual requirements of children.  The proposed change appears to absolve the Minister and the Department of these responsibilities.  My concern is that the Health Service Executive delivers health services and is not an education provider.  It delivers health services, and that is my particular concern.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The Department of Education and Skills cannot compel an agency of another Department to do certain things, which was expressed in the original legislation.  In effect, that turned out to be not practicable on the ground.  That is why the cross-sectoral team, which is an ad hoc body working between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health, is trying to address both the educational needs and the health needs of young people with learning difficulties.  The Bill being proposed is trying to align the legislation with what is happening on the ground.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Amendments Nos.6, 8, 9 and 16 are related, while amendment No. 7 is an alternative to amendment No. 6, so they may be discussed together.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 6, to delete lines 39 to 45 and substitute the following:"The numbers and qualifications of the teachers and other staff of a recognised school, who are to be remunerated out of monies provided by the Oireachtas, shallbe determined from time to time by the Minister after consultation with and with the agreement of bodies representative of patrons, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers, or other staff as appropriate and with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.".This is about the question of the agreement and the consultation on it.  The preamble of the Education Act 1998 specifically refers to the shared objective of education being provided in the spirit of partnership between the various stakeholders.  Any movement by the Minister, having the power, without either consultation or agreement, unilaterally to set out the appointment procedures, the dismissal and suspension procedures, and the terms and conditions of employment for teachers, would be in direct contravention of the preamble and the spirit of partnership, upon which the model of education in Ireland is founded.  By attempting to sideline the various stakeholders, the Minister is devaluing the huge contribution made by the voluntary members of the board of management.  This was raised during a recent Oireachtas meeting with those boards of management, who argued quite strongly against the changes being made.  These board members also raised the issue of having a right to consultation and input into processes which intimately affect and restrict how they run a school.  They are concerned that the Minister is trying to amend unilaterally the contract of employment of thousands of public employees, without the consent or agreement of employees and their representatives.The concern is that this changes the dynamic.  It gives more power to the Minister.  This was raised the other day when we were debating the Estimates.  We spoke about the perceived non-involvement in the drugs strategy and in the key pillar on rehabilitation.  There was also the issue in respect of the Ombudsman for Children and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs coming before an Oireachtas committee.  There were good relationships and consultation between those stakeholders and the Department of Justice and Equality, but they had difficulty with the Department of Education of Skills.The power is being shifted.  That consultation may be just down to a telephone call.  I am not saying the problem is with this Minister, but who knows what Minister might be down the road?  People are wondering why we should change the partnership model when it is working.  That is what my amendment is about.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I mentioned on Committee Stage that the representatives of the patron bodies - a large number of groups - made a presentation to the education committee and they outlined a number of practical changes they would like to see incorporated in this Bill.  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor participated in that debate as well.The Croke Park agreement is for a finite period of time.  Regardless of those people criticising it, it has brought benefits in the delivery of public services and in the management of the public service as well.  Does this Bill now put in legislation the redeployment elements of the Croke Park agreement?  I do not know whether it is advisable or if there is any requirement to pay redeployment processes and regulations on a legislative basis.  From speaking to the patron bodies, to the individual teachers, to principals and to chairpersons of boards of management, I understand the redeployment processes have worked well.  One notable aspect of the redeployment process is the difference in application vis-à-vis second level and primary schools.  There is no review of primary level while there is provision for review at second level.  The Minister might indicate to us if this is likely to change.It was very clear from the presentation made to us at the education committee that the representatives of the patron bodies were not looking for a veto.  They were very adamant that they wanted to get that message across, in case they would be misrepresented.  They wanted to continue the process of engaging with the Department and with the relevant stakeholders, as that process had worked well.  It was a process that was given particular impetus in the past two years in particular.  Mr. Hanevy, one of the Minister's assistant Secretaries General, was speaking at our committee earlier, and he spoke of the great dialogue that exists between the Department and its stakeholders.  He stated that before circulars are finalised, there is generally an input from the representatives bodies, including the patron bodies in this case.  When the Department, the patron bodies and the other stakeholders are cognisant of the value that partnership and the way that system has worked effectively, I do not know why there is a need to change it.In discussing issues in this House and on Committee Stage, we have all spoken with the potential for decentralising decision making.  The Minister has referred to that on a number of occasions, in respect of staffing, career guidance and devolving building projects to VECs.  This Bill effectively centralises employment provisions.  Is it advisable that the Department of Education and Skills should occupy centre stage in the employment process?  I do not think so.  As the partnership process has worked well, I believe it should be continued and it probably has the potential to be enhanced without the Oireachtas setting down legislative measures.I asked on Committee Stage if the patron bodies had been consulted prior to the finalisation of this Bill.  I presume that Mr. Hanevy's remarks this morning answer that question.   One other issue that has been raised - it was also raised by Deputy Crowe - is a concern among some of the teaching community that the employment contracts of thousands of people may well be changed by the enactment of this legislation.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  However, the effect of the amendments would be to introduce a general requirement that the Minister must consult and, in the case of Deputy Crowe's amendment No. 6, agree with the education partners any change in numbers, qualifications and terms of conditions of employment of teachers and other school staff.  It would also continue the requirement to reach agreement with all parties on appointment, suspension and dismissal procedures.  These matters were discussed at length by me in the Seanad and by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, on Committee Stage in this House.Amendments Nos.6 and 7 introduce a requirement to consult, and in the case of amendment No. 6, to agree the numbers and qualifications of teachers and other school staff.  Amendment No. 8 also introduces a requirement to consult and agree the terms and conditions of employment generally of school staff.  These amendments would set aside the existing provisions whereby the Ministers for Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform determine the numbers, qualifications and terms and conditions of employment.  Amendment No. 9 would impose a requirement to reach agreement on the redeployment procedures in schools.  I am not accepting amendments Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, as they would diminish the existing powers in legislation given to the Ministers and, by extension, the Government regarding numbers, qualifications and terms and conditions of teachers and other staff who are public servants and remunerated from public funds.  Neither can I accept amendment No. 9.The Bill is intended to remove any inherent weaknesses in the current legislation that inhibit the operation of redeployment processes or cause delay, in general or in individual cases, because a party withholds agreement.  Consultation is provided for and redeployment arrangements continue to be developed to accommodate issues that arise and ensure optimum results.  However, the net point, as I said extensively in the Seanad, is that there must be a capacity to overcome obstacles and ensure a fair distribution of staff and resources to all schools.I have references to amendment No. 16.  Is it being discussed with the other amendments, a Cheann Comhairle?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	188	It is.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	189	It is appropriate, therefore, that I should discuss it now.  The existing legal provision concerns three aspects of the terms and conditions of teachers and other staff - their appointment, suspension and dismissal.  It is limited to the procedures that apply or to be carried out in relation to these three aspects.  The new provision will ensure legal clarity in carrying out recruitment, suspension or dismissal, as the procedures that will apply in the future will not be subject to a potential veto by one party withholding agreement.  I am not, therefore, accepting the amendment because it would maintain such a veto.During the passage of the Bill through the Seanad there was clear affirmation of ongoing partnership within the schools system.  I said, "Agreement should not equate to unanimity or veto but, equally, consultation does not mean diktat or imposition."  I also gave assurances which I now give to this House that following enactment of the Bill departmental officials would engage in discussions with the education partners on having general consensus on the extent and quality of this consultation and how agreements could be reached.  Established procedures such as the Teachers Conciliation Council would be used as a vehicle for these discussions.I know the concerns expressed to Deputies by various interested groups and can understand why they have been expressed.  Let me outline my reason to the House.  In a redeployment case, for example, agreement might be reached by someone representing the teacher on one side and someone representing the Department or the school on the other.  However, while there might be agreement between the employers' representatives and the trade union's representatives, it might be withheld by the individual, the teacher.  We want to avoid that stalemate.  I was told by Mr. Martin Hanevy, to whom Deputy Brendan Smith referred, that we had had a few near misses the last time round.  They were avoided by good will on all sides, but there may not always be that good will in the future.  That is why it is correct to empower the Minister to use the words, "consult" and "agreement".I reaffirm the undertaking that I will have an exchange of letters with the education partners on what I mean by consultation and agreement.  However, I need this flexibility in the legislation.  My successors will also need it.

How legally binding would a letter of comfort be?  I am concerned about what is coming down the track.I accept what the Minister says about the difficulties encountered in redeployment.  However, consultation is important.

To avoid doubt and uncertainty, could the Minister's correspondence with the education partners be issued immediately following the signing of the legislation by President Higgins?

Amendment No. 10 is largely technical in nature and is intended to ensure the Teaching Council can share information with my Department and the VECs, not only in respect of those who are registered with it but also those who were but are not currently on the register.  This will help to reduce the risk of error when the data the council holds are matched with those held by the Department and the VECs.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I raised this on Committee Stage.  My amendment seeks an up-to-date online register of available teachers provided by the Teaching Council.  At one stage in the House we discussed the importance of that.  The reason for the amendment is to ensure technology such as the Internet is utilised to provide up-to-date information to principals and school authorities on the resources available to them.  It is one of the difficulties principals voice and it came up at the IPN conference.  I suppose it is one of the excuses some principals use in hiring teachers who have retired.It would be a positive development if the Teaching Council would provide this register.  I am attempting to put it in legislation.  If there was agreement from the Teaching Council that it would do this, I would be happy with that.  The non-availability of such a register is an issue that is continually raised and the provision of this enhanced service would facilitate the employment of newly qualified teachers on a short-term basis or in a crisis.  It would also help address the unjustifiable practice of employing recently retired teaching personnel on a temporary basis.When I first moved the amendment, the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, rejected the concept of an online register of available teachers by citing the additional requirement this would place on the Teaching Council.  He went on to state that under circular 31/2011, schools are required to keep a list of those appropriately qualified registered teachers who inform the school they are available for substitute teaching work.In practice, there seems to be a difficulty, not only at primary level but perhaps more so at secondary level, in areas of speciality, for example, home economics.  The management groups have all cited difficulties they have encountered in hiring a suitably qualified person, and this seems to apply throughout the country, although there does not seem to be a problem in some areas while there does seem to be in others.  My amendment aims to facilitate and assist principals and others in such a situation.  It is also about creating a system which does away with the need to call on recently retired teachers.  That is why I put forward the amendment.The Ceann Comhairle may say I am out of order on the following.  The Teaching Council has a power whereby a teacher cannot be paid until a determination is made.  That is also a difficulty and I do not know whether it will be addressed in the Bill.  I note the Teaching Council must give one month's notice in that regard but there is a difficulty with that timespan in that the Teaching Council determines when the teacher gets paid.  It might be a little late to review the matter at this stage, but perhaps the Minister will address that anomaly.  There has been considerable criticism of the Teaching Council by teachers.  The council needs to come up with initiatives and positive actions which would better enable it to engage with teachers.  One such positive action would be, as I have proposed, providing an up-to-date online register of qualified teachers.  The council might also have a role to play in assisting newly qualified teachers to secure employment.  While it does a great deal of positive work, it is not getting that message across.  An online register would be helpful in this regard.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	198	We are moving into new territory in regard to the employment of teachers.  Under this legislation, only a registered teacher will be legally eligible to be paid by a school with moneys derived from the taxpayer by way of the Department of Education and Skills.  Therefore, it behoves every prospective teacher, like every prospective voter, to ensure they are registered.  What we are seeking to do, without accidentally penalising anybody, is to have an information flow from the Teaching Council in respect of persons who were registered in the past but whose registration may have lapsed and those who are currently registered.  I do not wish to put precise rules in this regard in primary legislation other than what is in the text.  The Deputy can take it that we will have consultations with the council and will seek to ensure best practice prevails.  However, it is a professional responsibility for a teacher to ensure, where employment in the State sector is sought, that he or she is registered.I acknowledge the Deputy's comments in regard to certain criticisms of the Teaching Council, but it is not appropriate at this stage to examine them further.  At the recent trade union conferences, which both he and Deputy Smith attended, I had several informal discussions with council representatives.  It is a matter for the council itself to ensure it establishes a satisfactory relationship with its 73,000 registered members.

In page 8, line 21, to delete "may" and substitute "shall".The purpose of this amendment is to ensure there is the utmost clarity in respect of the requirement that the Minister prescribe the circumstances and conditions regarding the employment of a person in place of a registered teacher.  The Bill states that the Minister "may" prescribe those circumstances and conditions, which is insufficiently strong to eliminate concerns that a person might be employed in place of a registered teacher without being governed by ministerial regulation.  Any such uncertainty is unhelpful and unacceptable.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The amendment seeks to ensure that a person cannot be employed in place of a registered teacher without this being governed by ministerial regulation.  As written, the provision states that where the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to facilitate the urgent, temporary or occasional staffing needs of recognised schools, he or she may, from time to time, prescribe regulations governing the circumstances in which an unregistered person may be employed in place of a registered teacher and any conditions that might attach to that employment.  Those conditions could relate to a maximum time limit for the person's employment and the purposes for which he or she is employed.  The Bill does not give the Minister discretion to take any other type of measure through which an unregistered person may be employed in place of a registered teacher.  Therefore, if the Minister does not make regulations specifying the circumstances in which an unregistered person may be employed, such a person cannot be employed.  The Oireachtas is only permitting this to be done by regulation and not by any other instrument.  That is the advice I have been given and, as such, the Deputy's amendment is not necessary.

In page 9, to delete lines 5 to 13 and substitute the following:"(a) a requirement that a person referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (8) be employed in the place of a registered teacher in a recognised school in a position remunerated, or to be remunerated, out of monies provided by the Oireachtas if, and only if, no registered teacher is available to take up the position in question;”.This is essentially a drafting amendment which seeks to apply a belt and braces approach by including the reference to a "recognised school".
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I wish to flag an issue that has been raised in regard to the timing of the notification issued by the Teaching Council, that is, the period of time it has to make a determination, and the payment of salaries in the interim.  Under the legislation as it stands, the council must give one month's notice to a teacher in respect of his or her renewal or initial application of registration.  The council then has three months in which to make a determination and must give one month's notice of its intention to remove a person from the register.  There is a twofold anomaly in this regard.  First, if there is a delay on the part of the Garda vetting unit a teacher could end up, through no fault of his or her own and having furnished all of the required documentation, being removed from the payroll while continuing to fulfil his or her duties as teacher.  Second, the lead-in time is very tight to allow for a person to provide all of the required documentation.I urge the Minister to review the level of notification that is given to teachers in order to allow them sufficient time to get all of the documentation together in advance of their renewal notice or initial application to the register.  Will he, in addition, seek to introduce a streamlined process in regard to the engagement with the Garda vetting unit?  The major difficulty arises not in respect of persons who are residing in this jurisdiction and have done so all of their life but in the case of persons who have resided in another jurisdiction, whether within or outside the European Union, in respect of whom the Garda authorities must contact their counterparts in that jurisdiction.  Unfortunately there can be significant delays in securing a response in such cases, especially where the country in question is outside the European Union.  I have spoken to individuals who lived in countries like India and Pakistan, for example, where the length of time it takes to get a response from the police authorities can be considerable.  In such circumstances, a teacher might end up in a position where he or she is not on the payroll for weeks or months.  I urge the Minister to ensure we do not have people working for the Department or qualified persons whose appointment is delayed, through no fault of their own but purely because of difficulties arising with the bureaucratic paper trail.

The two amendments may, therefore, be discussed together.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 9, to delete lines 14 to 16 and substitute the following:"(b) a limit on the length for which such a person may be so employed in place of a registered teacher;”.The amendment provides that the regulations governing the employment of an unregistered person may include a limit on the length of time for which such person may be employed in the place of a registered teacher.  This is a change from the existing word which refers to the unregistered person being employed in a teaching position.  The change is proposed following representations from the INTO and from Deputy Smith and others.  The suggestion was that under the original wording an unqualified person could be deemed capable of filling a teacher's job.  The new wording is tighter - in order to be a registered teacher, one must, ipso facto, be a qualified teacher as distinct from merely a person being employed in a teaching position.  I am happy to accept this change.  Amendment No. 15 is similar in its intent.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I welcome the Minister's commitment in this regard, which follows commitments he made in respect of other provisions.  It is a welcome development.This issue has arisen during a number of debates and we must ensure that as many substitute teaching positions as possible are given to unemployed qualified, registered teachers rather than to retired personnel.  We are all well aware of the widespread concern about the lack of opportunities for newly qualified graduates and the need for those young people to get the relevant experience as well.  The employment of retired teachers as substitutes must be minimised as far as is practicable.I mentioned on Committee Stage that on occasion, be it for geographical reasons or in respect of the teaching of a particular subject, it is not always possible for a principal to employ other than a retired teacher and we accept those circumstances.  It is essential, however, that the message goes out that unemployed qualified graduates will get every available opportunity that arises.I welcome the Minister delivering on the commitment he made at the teachers' conferences at Easter.  Deputy Crowe no doubt has been spoken to on this issue, as I have and the Minister has, on this issue.  The INTO was lobbying hard to have this wording achieved and I welcome that.  If that section must be underpinned by a regulation or Department circular, it is essential the relevant circular or communication to the boards of management principals is absolutely clear on the obligations in appointing substitute teachers.  There can be no uncertainty or doubts in any communications that are issued; this should be the Bible for principals taking on substitute teachers.

What is the limit in that case?  It is not put down in the legislation but it would be useful if we knew the time because people are concerned about this.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	209	There is a limit of five days; after that there must be a reapplication process.I was happy to make this amendment.  It was central to the allaying of concerns expressed by unions and other representatives.  One must remember, however, that this is mainly a problem in primary schools and it is principals in those primary schools, who are union members, who until now have been making the decisions about hiring people.I understand from reports within the Department that there is a reduction in the salary scale for retired teachers coming back to teach on a temporary basis.  They do not come back at the same grade at which they retired, they come back at the starting grade so the financial incentive has been reduced.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I move amendment No. 17:
In page 10, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:"(15) The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 shall not apply to the dismissal of a person employed in a teaching position in a school where the dismissal follows directly from the cessation of the remuneration of that person out of monies provided by the Oireachtas.".Concerns have been expressed to me about the situation that might arise in special schools or Youthreach centres, or other second chance education centres.  Those special schools and Youthreach centres are providing excellent services and the people delivering those services as tutors or teachers may not be registered teachers but they are doing an excellent job.  We must clarify the long-term employment status of such people.  I know many such people and have seen the quality of their work in special schools and Youthreach centres.  A situation could arise where the Department of Education and Skills refuses to pay an unregistered teacher and that employee has a contractual commitment with a specific school.  In the event of an unfair dismissal case arising, the onus would be on the school, acting as employer, to meet the costs that might arise.  That could place a demanding onus on schools.  I hope through legislation and regulation that, which none of us want to see happening, eventually will be addressed.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	211	This matter was raised in the Seanad and on Committee Stage.  The combined effect of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 with this Bill, when enacted, will be to prohibit the payment of a person employed as a teacher in a recognised school unless he or she is a registered teacher.  The only exception to this will be where due to urgent temporary or occasional staffing needs, it is necessary to employ an unregistered person.  Therefore, the pay of a teacher must stop if his or her registration lapses.The issue of payment needs to be isolated from any other issue that might arise.  The Bill does not provide for a direction to dismiss a teacher who is not recognised, nor does it confer immunity from litigation in respect of a board of management or VEC that took disciplinary action solely as a result of a person no longer being registered with the council.  A protection for schools against an unfair dismissal claim along the lines being advocated by this amendment would be arbitrary and disproportionate.  It would mean that a person whose registration lapses for even one day could be dismissed summarily and without recourse to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.Different types of circumstances may arise for a person being unregistered after the commencement of section 30.  In some cases, the person might inadvertently cease to be registered due to an oversight on his or her part.  The number of days on which he or she is not registered might be very low.  In those cases any sort of disciplinary action might be regarded as inappropriate.  In other cases, the person may need a significant period of time to gain the necessary qualifications to become registered.  In these cases it may be appropriate to facilitate that person by granting him or her a period of unpaid leave.  Equally, there may be cases where a person simply chooses not to register, despite the fact he or she has all the necessary qualifications.In any of these circumstances, there is no termination of the employment of the unregistered person; he or she simply cannot be paid from Oireachtas funds while he remains unregistered.   If a person takes other action, such as absenting himself or herself from the school without permission, this should be treated in the same way as if he had done so while being paid.  In other words, this is a matter that is separate and should be treated separately.

It is the view of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that it is legally necessary that the wording of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 contains a reference to the qualification of that section by the proposed section 24(8) of the Education Act 1998.  It is a belt and braces cross-referencing.

#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill which represents a major step forward in the reform of the commercial vehicle roadworthiness systems.  The Bill was drafted to take account of the key recommendations arising from the review of the tragic bus crashes at Kentstown, County Meath in my constituency and Clara, County Offaly, in which a total of six children lost their lives.  Approximately one in five fatal collisions involves a commercial vehicle, but the existing roadworthiness testing systems for such vehicles have remained largely unchanged since 1982.The Bill which is sponsored by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is one part of a wide-ranging programme of reform relating to commercial vehicle roadworthiness systems and reflects best international practice.  The enactment of the legislation will facilitate the transfer of local authorities' functions in respect of the roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles, namely, light and heavy goods vehicles and buses, to the Road Safety Authority.  The Bill will als reforms the way commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing centres and authorised testers are licensed, in addition to providing greater powers of enforcement through targeted roadside inspections and inspections of commercial operators' premises.The reform programme will drive a step change in the roadworthiness standards relating to commercial vehicles operating on Ireland's roads.  It will save lives and prevent injuries by reducing the number of accidents involving commercial vehicles on the roads.  The key benefits of the programme include: reducing congestion and other economic costs to the State; creating a level playing field for Ireland's operators through targeting those who choose not to maintain their fleets in a roadworthy condition; enhancing testing and the testing efficiency of Ireland's network of commercial vehicle and ADR test centres, at which the roadworthiness of vehicles carrying dangerous goods is tested; and ensuring greater compliance in commercial vehicle annual testing.The legislation will provide a legal basis to deliver the commercial vehicle roadworthiness reform programme and also facilitate the transfer of the management of the testing function from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority, the enhanced performance management of the testing system and the introduction of operator maintenance obligations and enhanced powers for roadside testers in respect of non-compliant vehicles.  For the first time, commercial vehicle testing centres across the country will be obliged to comply with a uniform nationwide standard which will be enforced by the Road Safety Authority.  In addition to the road safety benefits, the transfer of this responsibility from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority will save in the region of €4.5 million.  This will obviously be of benefit to the country in the light of current economic circumstances.The priority with the Bill is to ensure the safety of passengers, drivers and all other road users.  The Bill will ensure the same standards are applied across the country, regardless of where a vehicle is tested.  The new system will be more consistent, impartial and, most importantly, accurate.  As stated, approximately one in five fatal collisions involves a commercial vehicle.  However, the existing system of testing roadworthiness has remained largely unchanged since 1982.  The Bill proposes that the Road Safety Authority will assume responsibility for the centralised supervision and licensing of private testing services for commercial vehicles.  The new roadside inspections programme will ensure continuous compliance with the relevant standards, including by random checks of vehicles.  The provisions in the Bill mean that for the first time there will be a single integrated system to link enforcement, checks of operators' fleets, maintenance records and annual roadworthiness tests.  The new system will be more consistent, impartial and accurate.  Resources will be targeted at those vehicle operators considered most likely to break the law.  However, the Road Safety Authority will ensure those with good track records will continue to be supervised in order that they will maintain the standards they have achieved.  The Bill will create a level playing field by ensuring vehicle operators who maintain their fleets will not be placed at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those who break the law.Thankfully, Ireland is the fifth safest country in Europe in which to drive.  The number of people killed on the roads has halved during the past decade.  However, the position in this regard can still be improved.  The legislation will go a long way towards enhancing and improving Ireland's already good road safety record.  I commend the Minister for bringing it forward.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	224	There are many important items of legislation which come before the House and which relate to areas such as health, education, the environment and justice.  However, legislation on road safety relates to all citizens, namely, pedestrians, drivers, passengers and everyone who uses the road network.  The Bill deals with many matters pertaining to the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles.  It is worth noting the road safety statistics for accidents on the roads involving commercial and heavy goods vehicles.  In 2007, 32 people were killed in road accidents in which heavy goods vehicles were involved.  This was reduced to 17 in 2010, a welcome reduction.  A major factor in this reduction was the improvement in the main road and motorway network.  The average number of road deaths per month in 2011 was 16.  In 2012 the average is 13 to the end of February.  The numbers of fatalities on the roads have fallen in recent years, with the lowest annual figure achieved in 2011 at 186.  However, it must be noted Road Safety Authority, RSA, statistics tell us that there were over 700 accidents in 2010 involving heavy goods vehicles outside built-up areas and over 500 within built-up areas.  In essence, a lot more needs to be done to address this issue which the Minister is doing with this Bill.It is worth noting the major improvements in the motorway network in the past eight years, one of only a few positive legacies from the Celtic tiger.  To be fair, we have seen a significant decline in the number of road deaths parallel to this road network upgrade.  Accordingly, I must compliment the last two Governments on undertaking this work.  It was a pity, however, that we in Sligo were not connected by motorway to Dublin in the same way as were Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny, Dundalk, Drogheda, Belfast, Athlone and Mullingar.I want to highlight how important road improvements are in road safety.  The section of the N4 between Boyle and Sligo, in particular at Castlebaldwin, has been an accident black spot, at which there have been numerous deaths and injuries simply because this section of the road cannot deal with the volume of traffic using it, particularly the number of heavy goods and commercial vehicles which use it.  Over 65% of accidents on this stretch involve commercial vehicles which is proof, if proof was required, that road improvements and motorway structures automatically decrease the chance of road accidents and fatalities occurring.  I am taking the opportunity to impress this point on the Minister.  I am aware that the capital budget for road improvements and building is virtually nil.  However, the level of domestic growth in the economy is almost nil and unless we improve access to the regions, especially in the northern half of the country, it will remain stagnant.  Tourism, industry and manufacturing depend on a good road network alongside a major improvement in road safety.  Will my Government colleagues consider this argument should we consider a stimulus package in the future provided by the European Union?The Bill proposes to nominate the RSA as the main testing organisation for vehicle roadworthiness taking this function away from local authorities.  This is to be welcomed as allowing the RSA, an organisation specifically with a remit in road safety, to take charge of this issue makes real sense in order to have one national body with a defined function.  The old system was inconsistent, provided for no roadside inspections and had no national database.  Overall responsibility for commercial road testing will remain with the Minister, although he can confer powers, except the power to make regulations assigned to him in the Bill, to the RSA, in which case those power can be exercised by either him or the RSA.The Bill provides that the testing of commercial vehicles will be done through a network of commercial vehicle roadworthiness, CVR, test operators authorised to operate test centres, carry out tests and issue pass certificates.  Vehicles which have received pass statements will be issued with certificates of roadworthiness.  Commercial vehicles cannot be used in public places without such certificates.CVR testers, as licensed by the Minister, must have no previous criminal convictions.  This will ensure we will have the correct people as testers without a shadowy background.  In short, they must have the proper premises, equipment, background and qualifications before they can be authorised.  It is welcome that authorised officers will also be able to enter and inspect CVR vehicles on the premises and observe and supervise vehicle testing in progress.  Furthermore, authorised inspectors will also be able to inspect and remove documentation related to the maintenance and testing of vehicles.  The powers of authorised officers are not limited and will vary.Roadside inspections will be carried out by CVR inspectors who are defined as inspectors appointed under section 34 or a member of An Garda Síochána.  Vehicles and other items may also be inspected.  A CVR inspector who is accompanied by a garda or who is a garda can stop a vehicle for inspection.  The vehicle can be detained for a reasonable period.  Once it has been stopped by a garda, the CVR officer has the specific power to drive a vehicle, look for relevant information and seek the appropriate certificate.  Failure to comply can in cases allow the inspector to impound the defective vehicle.All of these measures and many more contained in the Bill will ensure an improvement in the commercial and heavy goods vehicles on the roads that will contribute to a more reputable industry and reduce the number of road accidents.  The road haulage and transport business is in one of the most difficult positions in the domestic economy.  As fuel prices are rising, charges will have to go up.  Rogue transport operators, with poor vehicles in some cases, undercut many of the reputable transport companies which spend money on regular servicing and essential safety maintenance.  These reputable operators will now find their position enhanced because of this legislation.  I expect the aforementioned CVR inspectors to target the dodgy transport providers.I welcome the Bill's proposal to allow the RSA to become the agency responsible for the issuing of driving licences.  Currently, 29 local authorities under the overall authority of the Department are in charge of the licensing system.  Next year will see the welcome introduction of a plastic chip-type card which will become the norm for licences.  The benefits will be that it will reduce fraud and harmonise the licensing system across Europe.  Drivers required to produce their licence to European police forces will be more responsible for their actions abroad, which will improve intercountry security in the European Union.  This system has been in place in the United States for many years and ensures vital data can be read from cards in order that police officers can assess motorists on the spot.  Such a system would be welcome in Ireland.  I welcome the idea of a having centralised model for driving licences.  This move will offer greater efficiencies in the overall delivery of the service and fit well with the Government's public service reform agenda.  It will provide all motorists with a better service.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I welcome the opportunity to debate the Road Safety (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Bill 2012 which overhauls the system for testing the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles and permits the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to assign new functions in this area to the RSA.  In addition, the driving licence system will be centralised and transferred from local authorities to the RSA.  The Bill is the latest road safety measure introduced as part of the Government's road safety strategy.Following the bus crashes in Kentstown, County Meath and Clara, County Offaly in 2005 and 2006, the RSA was asked to carry out a comprehensive review of the arrangements for the roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles.  This review highlighted a wide number of issues with the testing system.  Commercial vehicles are required to undergo a roadworthiness test at an authorised testing centre annually.  Commercial vehicle testing is undertaken by 158 independent operators using a variety of test facilities, supervised and regulated by 30 public bodies with limited enforcement activities.  In these circumstances, it is almost impossible to achieve consistent high-quality testing and assurances that the commercial fleet is in a roadworthy condition.  The use of a single authority to monitor and enforce standards is considered the best means of ensuring consistent practices, streamlined procedures, clearer communication channels and greater accountability within the service.To date in 2012, there have been significantly fewer road deaths than at the same stage in 2011.  As of 17 April 2012, 46 people have died on Irish roads in the year, 13 fewer than the same period in 2011.  Testing must be carried out in a consistent, impartial and correct fashion at all times.  There will be continuous compliance with roadside inspections with the assistance of An Garda Síochána, along with the introduction of intelligence-based monitoring of the sector and risk-based targeting of commercial vehicle roadworthiness by the Road Safety Authority and Garda.  The test centres will also operate on a risk basis.Under EU licensing Directive 2006/126, all member states are required to introduce a plastic card driving licence in January 2013.  Currently, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has overall responsibility for driving licences, whereas the RSA has operational oversight and a policy advisory role.  The RSA role includes liaising with EU representatives on driving licence matters at EU level.  There are 29 licensing authorities - motor tax offices - around the country and the new rules to be introduced are designed to reduce fraud, guarantee a true freedom of movement for EU drivers and reinforce safety on European roads.Improving road safety is one of the main objectives of the driving licence legislation.  The implementation of a single model throughout the European Union will ensure greater security, and it was agreed by the Department and the RSA that the introduction of a new form of licence would provide an opportunity to review the existing licence issuing system and whether greater efficiencies and effectiveness could be achieved.  The review was overseen by a steering committee comprising the representatives of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the RSA and the Garda Síochána.  The report recommended that the driving licence system should be modernised through centralising the functions in one authority.  In May 2011, the Government approved the decision to move the centralised model of driving licences to the RSA.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to this new legislation.  I welcome the debate as it gives us a real chance to get into the detail of road safety, traffic and commercial vehicle issues and broader financial matters.  It is a wide-ranging debate and I am delighted the Minister of State is in the House.Before getting to the detail of the legislation, I will raise a significant commercial vehicle safety matter relating to the Dublin Port tunnel.  A dangerous incident could happen at any minute and there is a catastrophe waiting to happen.  I urge the Minister of State to take on board the information I will supply today.  Currently, all the vehicle lay-bys in the tunnel have a sheer wall at a right angle to the direction of traffic.  It is the same design as the lay-by wall in the Swiss tunnel where recently a Belgian school bus crashed, killing 28 people, 22 of whom were children.  I would like to see some action taken, as within a week of the Swiss accident, which sadly resulted in 28 deaths, the Swiss authorities installed safety barriers in the tunnel to prevent vehicles from directly hitting the wall.I ask the Minister of State, the National Roads Authority and the operators of the Dublin Port tunnel to ensure this can be examined immediately.  I raise this not only as a local public safety issue but as a national public safety matter.  The Swiss responded within a matter of weeks when they spotted the problem and a safety barrier should be erected to stop buses from being driven into sheer walls.  Safety is an important part of Irish driving life and it is relevant to this debate.  I urge the Minister of State to go back to the senior officials in his Department and put that issue before them.  It is a genuine public safety issue about which people have major concerns.  There should be action before we have another incident.  There have been major problems affecting the Dublin Port tunnel, with homes damaged etc.  I have worked very closely with the residents in Marino, Santry, Drumcondra, Fairview and right across Dublin North-Central in supporting their efforts.  Those people were compensated in the end.  It is important to deal with such public safety issues.This Bill provides for reform of the commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing system.  That is sensible and all political parties should welcome it.  The legislation also seeks to introduce a plastic card driving licence and revise administrative arrangements for the processing and management of driving licences.  I know some of my colleagues touched on these issues earlier but I will also deal with them at a later time.  This legislation will have implications for all drivers, and those of us who do much travelling around the city and country will find it relevant.The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a legislative framework for commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing in the State.  The Bill will see the functions of local authorities in relation to CVR testing being assumed by the Road Safety Authority.  In addition, the Bill will provide for a new licensing system in respect of test centres and authorised testers as well as greater powers of enforcement through targeted roadside inspections and inspections of commercial operators' premises.  I mentioned road safety, and we must have proper planning of barriers etc., but there must also be enforcement.  A number of colleagues from all parties have stated on the record that there is a major issue with some operators, and we cannot tolerate that.  There must be qualified inspections of these commercial operators, although at the same time we must not overdo it or harass people.  I will refer to this later.Safety is the key word.  In 2009, the fatality rate was 53 people per million of population but in 1999 the rate was 110 people per million of population; it seems there is improvement in road safety.  We are discussing vehicles, and 52% of all motor vehicles involved in fatal collisions in 2009 were registered in 2001 or earlier, so there is a link between the collisions and roadworthiness of some of the cars and vehicles.  Nobody is squeaky clean in this regard, and we have all had bangers.  We must be responsible in maintaining the vehicles, inspections and road safety.  Road deaths in Ireland have fallen to their lowest level since records were officially taken in 1959, which I welcome.  I mentioned the rate of deaths, and at 53 deaths per million of population, it is less than half the rate in 1999, when the first Government road safety strategy commenced.  There was an increase in reports of minor injury collisions in 2009, which contrasted with decreasing trends in recent years.We are dealing with safety and people's lives but there are also injuries to consider.  Another relevant issue is being neglected in this debate, although it is very relevant to the broader economic discussion.  The estimated costs of all road collisions reported through and recorded by An Garda Síochána is in the region of €974 million.  It is a high figure but reflects a reduction of 29% since 2007.We have been getting lectures in recent days about the fiscal treaty and budgetary strategies.  I am in favour of improving road safety measures to reduce costs to the Garda.  A sum of €974 million to pay for the fallout from road deaths and collisions is a significant cost to the taxpayer and it must be examined.  Health and safety in people's lives are the most important issue and, therefore, I do not want to dwell on the cost because a person killed in a road traffic accident cannot be replaced but a figure of €974 million jumps out.  Good planning, sensible legislation and good road safety measures can lead to a reduction in this amount.  It was reduced by 29% over the past five years and, therefore, the Government can push the boat out further on this.  The safety of our citizens is not a party political issue unlike the economic crisis.  If somebody brings in legislation, tables amendments or comes up with new ideas to improve road safety, I will support him or her and I will not sit on the fence.A total of 52% of all motor vehicles involved in fatal collisions were registered in 2001 or earlier.  More than half were dodgy cars or cars that were at risk and this is a strong connection.  The good news is this legislation is an attempt to do something about this.  We must ensure we all work closely on this issue.  We must come up with other strategies to deal with traffic and road safety issues.I was disappointed when the metro north project was postponed and not just for the north side of Dublin.  I am not locally biased politically.

There was a great deal of disappointment.  I accept budgets are tight and everything is difficult but I urge the Minister of State to revisit this project which has significant potential for job creation and economic development on the north side of Dublin.  Do not mind all the yuppies on the south side who seem to have a problem about the north side.

That is my little whinge in this regard.  I served on Dublin City Council in 1999 and it has done a great deal of work on its budgets in tough times.  For example, the council completed 23 km of road surfacing last year, which was positive.  Meanwhile road salt was well stocked last winter.  Officials are also trying to purchase software to deal with road asset management issues.  The road maintenance, design and construction departments have merged into one, which is a sensible rationalisation.  The department is also moving to do a little work on local footpaths and roads.  A month ago, we raised a road safety issue where I live on Charlemont Estate, Griffith Avenue, Marino, with the city manager relating to ramps.  In fairness to the area manager and the staff of the city council, they had repaired all the ramps on the estate within seven days and significantly enhanced road safety.  I acknowledge, therefore, that works are taking place.The focus of the legislation is on safety but vehicle licensing and safety cannot be discussed without mentioning fuel prices.  We are all getting it in the neck, particularly from small business owners, including plumbers and so on, about the impact of the cost of fuel on them.  The Government needs to listen to small business people who are being hammered on the fuel issue.  Fuel costs are going through the roof and some are going abroad to get fuel while criminal elements are engaged in illegal fuel smuggling, which must be addressed.  The Government should listen to small business owners on the ground because they face many problems.  Those who have to use vans and cars need to be listened to more.  I acknowledge voices within the Government are pushing that agenda privately.  They cannot highlight this publicly but we are behind them because if we are going to get out of the recession, we must support small businesses.We all regularly whinge about the banks but I attended a good meeting in the AIB branch in Artane last Monday week.  The bank manager called all small business owners in Artane and Killester and all public representatives to a meeting.  We all thought 20 or 30 people would attend but when I walked in the door, almost 150 small business people were present.  The good news is the bank manager said AIB was open for business and it would give loans to small businesses to support them.  There are examples of good practice but we need to push banks further and hammer those sitting on the fence and doing nothing.  If there are examples of good practice, whether they are in the banks, the road safety sphere or in the House, we should take them on board.One thing that has been doing my head in over the past few days is the ranting and raving of the Minister for Health, the bully boy, who is encouraging the health police to target smoking in cars.  I am a smoker and the vast majority of smokers I know would never dream of smoking in a car when accompanied by young children.  Would the Minister get off the stage and stop ranting and raving about this?  Most smokers are responsible; we are not lepers.  We comprise 30% of the population and it is probable that 30% of Oireachtas Members smoke.  It is time to get away from the nanny state, give us a break and to be sensible about this.  The proposal to drive smokers off beaches and out of parks means we cannot even go outside and have a smoke for five minutes.  The Minister should get off the stage, give us all a break and cop on to himself.  We are all big boys and girls and we do not want to live in a society where our civil liberates are gradually being eroded.  What has he planned next?  Will we not be able to go out and have two or three pints on a Friday night?  That is not the kind of society I want to live in.  Most smokers will not smoke in cars when accompanied by children.  A small minority do but that is another issue.  The Minister should not label people.  He should also examine the amount of tax we contribute to the State every year and have a word with the Minister for Finance about the revenue generated.  He should quit hammering smokers and give us a break from the nanny state.Speeding and the location of speed traps is a road safety issue.  Some of them are in ridiculous locations and it is like shooting fish in a barrel.  Speed traps should be in place on dangerous roads and easy options should not be taken, although this is a regular feature of our society.  The legislation should address this issue.Section 6(1) provides that a person cannot use a CVR vehicle in a public place without a certificate of roadworthiness.  I support that because we have to do it and I referred to the road safety issues involved earlier.  Section 6(2) provides for a class A fine or term of imprisonment for a person who commits an offence by contravening section 6(1).  I worry about the reference to a term of imprisonment.  Judges have lost their way.  Non-violent and petty criminals are sentenced to six or seven years in jail while those who kill or seriously injure other people or threaten to murder them get away with a three of four year sentence.  There is something radically wrong with sentencing.  I do not want a motorist caught in a stupid situation to end up in prison while violent criminals walk the streets.  One case in which I was personally involved recently, which I thought was a grave injustice, was the garlic tax case where Mr. Paul Begley got a sentence of six years for a scam on small businesspeople.  Mr. Begley employs over 200 people.  He has paid his penalties and his tax and he has paid his debt to society yet where is he as I speak?  In Mountjoy.  We have lost the run of ourselves.  Yes, that man did wrong and should be punished but while he has paid his fines and penalties and paid his debt to society, he is languishing for six years.  Some of the gangs in Limerick and Dublin have threatened people and they got two or three years.  Where is the logic or justice in that?I appeal to the Minister for Justice and Equality for common sense in our justice system.  I welcome the proposals yesterday with regard to releasing people who are genuinely not a threat to society and I suggest that community service projects and other good work can be done by such people.  To take the Paul Begley case, imagine if he was released tomorrow morning and sent on community service in a disadvantaged area in Dublin where he was asked to advise and support small businesses as part of his punishment.  We can do sensible things within the justice system.I raise the Paul Begley case because I feel the sentence is a grave injustice.  I am not saying he should not be punished for breaking the law, which some smart alecs out there have tried to represent as my position on this issue.  I raise this in the context of subsection (2), which deals with terms of imprisonment.Section 7 refers to the power to require production of a certificate of roadworthiness to a member of the Garda Síochána, which is another measure we must ensure is put in place.  I welcome the legislation and some of the major constructive proposals it contains.  I urge the Minister and the Government, when implementing legislation and the laws of the land, to use common sense, whether in regard to road safety or dealing with issues in our justice system.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  It is common sense, practical and, essentially, gives a consistent and logical approach in this area.Some days ago I brought my car for the NCT test.  I remember the fuss about the NCT when it was first introduced but it is a very good system which people accept.  It is working well and there is a real sense of assurance, especially for those of us who do a lot of mileage, that the vehicle being driven is safe because somebody independent has tested it.  That is very important.The administrative functions in the Bill are moving from the local authorities to the RSA.  There will be new licensing system for test centres and also for authorised testers.  This sort of consistency is important in order that we get a common thread across the country and no areas are over-scrutinised or under-scrutinised.I am somewhat concerned in regard to Chapter 3, section 31(1)(a), which allows the officer to “search the premises in order to locate the CVR vehicle or vehicles”.  I am not sure of the aim of this section because, if the vehicle is not on the road, it should not be an issue.  The section is too vague for my liking and I question why private premises would be entered in this way.  However, there might be a good reason which will be clarified later.Chapter 3, section 31(1)(e) allows for permission to “remove and retain such books, documents or records for such period as may be reasonable for further examination”.  This is definitely too vague.  The time period must be specified as to when documentation will be returned.  The subsection does not add up.I welcome the introduction of the plastic driving licence and it is about time it happened.  How many of us curse the current licences which are too bulky and messy, and do not deliver well out of a washing machine.  I am delighted to see this introduced.  For those of us who happen to be in a suit one minute and in ordinary clothes the next, if the licence fits neatly into a wallet, it will always be on the driver, which is good.  One of the complaints about the other licence was that, given its plastic cover and so on, putting it in a pocket damaged its appearance.The licences should contain biometric data and there should be some identifier unique to the person so there would be clarity that the person with the licence is, indeed, the licence holder.  People who have nothing to hide should not fear anything from this whereas it will expose those who have something to hide.This also brings up the whole issue of foreign driving licences.  For many years, foreign licences have come into the country but gardaí are unable to assess immediately whether the licences are genuine or otherwise, or whether the right people are holding the licences.  This is a matter of concern.  Obviously, in an open economy such as ours, many people come into and out of the country and, while it is important to regulate ourselves, it also important to ensure that those people with foreign licences comply completely.The issue of the maintenance of commercial vehicles was highlighted, as the Minister rightly said yesterday, by the Kentstown crash.  This terrible situation demonstrated the importance of maintenance.  One of my bugbears is that this crash did not involve a private operator but Bus Éireann.  The assumption is that this is just an issue with private operators who might not put money into their machines but this was a large organisation which the State funds to the tune of approximately €110 million per year for school transport.  Nonetheless, it got it wrong.I also strongly criticise - my feelings on this are well known - the new tendering system which is being put in place for school transport whereby buses aged ten years or older are coming on stream to transport our children.  I firmly believe we should be implementing a system where purpose-built buses are available to transport our most precious commodity, our children.  It is shocking that bus drivers who have been driving routes for 20 years find themselves thrown out under this new system only for their buses to be replaced by older buses.  This is not acceptable and it is only a matter of time before there is an issue.  I would welcome a tendering system for the transport of children.  I do not believe this should be within the remit of Bus Éireann solely because we need to get value for the taxpayer as well.When I talk about the maintenance of commercial vehicles, I have connections in this regard because the business I run deals with bulk transport.  Unfortunately, road hauliers are having a terrible time at present.  These people are providing a great service in this country and they transport everything that is essential for our economic well-being.  Unfortunately, however, they are living on depreciation.  What I mean is that because the rates they get for their work are dropping, as there are apparently too many of them, they are not able to renew their lorries in time and, therefore, their lorries are getting older and more maintenance needs to be done.  This is a pathway to the bottom.I would like to see a fair pricing mechanism for hauliers so there would be some standard from which they could work and hauliers would then compete on service quality as opposed to pricing down to the bitter end.  I see good, compliant businesses that have been in business for 20 years tender only to be priced out of it by a completely unrealistic quote.  This tells me one thing: that the person with the unrealistic quote is not on a level playing pitch.  Either they are doing something incorrectly, their taxes are not in order or something else does not add up.  Something is wrong when people who have been in business for more than 20 years cannot compete.Fuel laundering was mentioned.  It is a significant issue.  Not only does it affect the taxpayer but it also affects the engines of many vehicles.  Modern engines are sensitive and the extraction process used involves acid which damages the engines.  People do not realise this.  One might think one was using is cheaper fuel, but one gets fewer miles per gallon and one damages the engine in the long run.  This must be addressed.This is a sensible and practical Bill which lays the basis on which commercial vehicles will be maintained in future.  It is common sense and it is remarkable that nothing like this was in place already.  Thankfully, the country will see a significant increase in commercial vehicles in the coming years, especially in the agricultural sector as we implement the Food Harvest 2020 recommendations.  We will see a 50% increase in the production of milk.  Milk is bulky and, therefore, we will see huge volumes of milk being transported throughout the country as well as huge volumes of dairy products, including cheeses and others.  We should not forget the grain sector.  We had the largest harvest in the history of State last year amounting to 2.5 million tonnes.  Thankfully for the sector we are due to have a similar harvest next year.  We will see an increase and this is part of our recovery as a nation.  The Bill will ensure this occurs in a safe and consistent fashion.

I have no wish to labour the points made by my colleagues other than to say that road safety is a major concern nowadays.  Heavy vehicular traffic on roads is growing.  Recently, on a trip from Cork to Dublin beginning at 1.30 a.m., I met coming towards me in the opposite direction 130 heavy goods vehicles.  From an economic point of view, that is a good sign, demonstrating activity in the country.  It is also indicative of the heavy volume of traffic on the roads.  It is also a good thing to see such traffic is not on the road during peak hours.  The Acting Chairman will note I did not count the vehicles going in the other direction but I promise I did not break the speed limit.  I was a very good boy.The crash in County Meath some years ago with its tragic consequences is a moot point.  It left an impression on us all and we should remember what happened there.  Whether deliberately or negligently, the circumstances that brought about the accident in terms of vehicle testing failures have not been addressed to any great extent yet except in the context of this proposal. One can point to issues that should have been raised as part of a vehicle test and which should have been readily recognised but were not.  That should not be the case.I have a reasonable mechanical knowledge but one must get underneath a vehicle to find out what is going on.  I have been shocked at some of the things I have seen in recent years since that unfortunate and tragic accident in Meath.  A similar accident occurred in County Offaly.  I cannot understand why people would knowingly do something or fail to take action in respect of a vehicle safety issue.Some people maintain we should have annual or six-monthly reviews.  One need not be a rocket scientist to carry out an overhaul of the linkages and joints in a vehicle which directly affect its safety.  This could last for three years if the inspection were to be carried out properly by competent people.  There is no excuse.  Therefore, it must be a case of deliberate negligence - there is no other way around it - and that is criminal.  Unfortunately, that is what it amounts to if it leads to loss of life, which it can.Let us consider the safety factors we should bear in mind.  Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned the bangers we drove in the past.  However, we drove at a different speed at the time.  We did not have motorways at the time and we did not really have occasion to travel at high speed on narrow country roads because the vehicles did not have the competence to do so.  As tyres wear on a vehicle, one should slow down.  One cannot have the same grip at all times.  Allegedly, I have been severe on tyres in the past as well as at present.  One must take account of the wear on tyres and the ability of the vehicle to hold the road in all circumstances.  Brakes raise others issues.  Sadly, not all vehicle brakes will stand up to rigorous tests, even today.  This should show up on a National Car Testing Service, NCTS, examination.  The smallest details such as a bulb that does not work will be found under the test.  Strangely, the tyres do not appear as an issue in the test unless they are seriously worn, and this is extraordinary.  Suspension in a vehicle has a considerable impact on its road-holding capacity.  Bad or weak suspension joints cause serious problems, especially in an emergency situation.I imagine every Member has had occasion to meet what appeared to be a motorcycle coming towards them on the road at night only to discover that it was actually a four-wheeled vehicle.  Sometimes such large vehicles have only one light on the left-hand side, creating a more serious problem.  I recall having a slight brush with another vehicle in such a situation some years ago.  Such situations are difficult on a narrow road or a road only barely capable of having two vehicles.  Such a fault can occur rather suddenly and the individual concerned may not have had a chance to get to a garage and have it repaired.  However, the fact remains this is a considerable and serious issue and must be attended to as a matter of urgency.The regionalisation of the testing centres may be a good thing or a bad thing.  It may be good in the sense that high standards should apply.  However, high standards should apply anyway.  Any vehicle testing centre, whether local or regional, should comply with the highest possible standards.  If it does not do so, the system is weakened.  My colleague, Deputy Tom Barry, referred to the powers of the authorities to impound or search a vehicle or a premises with vehicles.  There are other reasons this should be the case but they do not relate to safety.  Legislation of a different nature should be used to deal with such situations.I have a long-standing hobby of playing around with classic cars.  I do not play with vintage cars but rather those from the era I represent.  I have always kept one or two such vehicles.  They have not been driven yet but they will drive some day.  It is no business of anyone else since they are not on the road and they are not road vehicles.  They are off the road and if I wish to bring them on the road, I will do all that must be done and I will comply with all regulations necessary to bring them on the road.  However, it is no business of anyone else whether I have one or none, whether they are in a good or bad state or whether they will ever run again.  That is my business.  Everyone has their foibles in this life.  Long may it continue that one may have them and be in compliance with the law.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	236	In July last year the Government approved the draft heads of a new consumer and competition Bill as submitted by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Part of that decision involved giving effect in legislation to the recommendations of the Report of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers and to transfer responsibility for public interest considerations relating to media mergers from the Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to my Department.  The existing legislative provisions governing these issues date from 2002, and the advisory group recommended a thorough revision of these in 2008.Primary responsibility for promulgating the consumer and competition Bill 2012 rests with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  He and I discussed this issue following the formation of this Government, following on from a series of discussions between officials, and agreed the transfer of responsibility in respect of the media mergers to this Department.The consumer and competition Bill 2012 is one of a large number of Government Bills currently being drafted by the Attorney General's office, and I gather that it is likely to be later in the year before a draft Bill is ready to be published and brought before the Oireachtas.  I would like to point out that the Bill has not been delayed a number of times; the entirety of the delay thus far has been due to the amount of legislation in train and the particular priority that has had to be given to certain legislation in the context of the commitments made to the troika.The critical role of the media in our democracy, and the potentially harmful effects of an over concentration of media ownership, means this issue is a vitally important one.  The Government remains committed to implementing a set of robust measures that allow for a transparent and objective assessment of the public good in media mergers cases, and to do so as quickly as possible.  Officials from my Department are actively engaged in the drafting process, in consultation with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, with the objective of ensuring that my primary concerns around the preservation of plurality and diversity in media will be reflected in the draft Bill.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	237	The Minister states in his reply that the Bill has not been delayed but on 14 September 2011 it was on the B list with a publication date of early 2012, on 11 January 2012 it was on the B list with a publication date of mid-2012 and on 17 April it was still on the B list with a publication date of late 2012.  It is moving on but events outside this House are beginning to catch up with it.  The functions are to be transferred to the Minister's Department.  When will the Minister assume full responsibility for that element of it?  Is there scope or a need for separate legislation or will it still come under the umbrella of the competition and consumer Bill on media mergers?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	238	As the Deputy knows, broadcasting is currently the responsibility of this Department.  After the Bill to which he refers is enacted, this Department will be also  responsible for print media.  In terms of how early that is likely to happen, it has to await the enactment of the major revision of competition law that is in the new competition and consumer Bill.  It is a major Bill.  The Deputy is correct.  It has been dislocated, as have some other Bills, primarily because of the pressures on us from the troika to give priority to other pieces of legislation.  I agree with the Deputy that this is an important Bill.  Once the Bill is enacted, it is the responsibility of this Department and has no interaction with the other Department.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	239	The Deputy will be aware that neither I nor the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, has received the report on offshore oil and gas exploration from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture.  I understand the committee has engaged with the subject matter of this report for more than six months and over that time has invited a range of parties to give evidence before it.  My Department made a presentation to the committee in September last and has provided additional material since then to assist the committee in its work.I understand the committee's report is due to be published shortly and I look forward to receiving a copy as soon as it is available.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be happy to discuss the report and its recommendations as soon as I have the opportunity to read and consider the report in detail.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I thank the Minister for the response.  The report will be published next Wednesday.  As the Minister stated in his response, in recent months the committee met representatives of different sectors in regard to offshore exploration.  While my party may have a more radical view, the Minister will find there is an element of compromise in the report on the part of all concerned for the greater good.  The report will be in advance of where we are now but it will be taken in the light of trying to get a better return for our resources.  While many arguments were made in the past regarding incentives and so forth, we are at a stage now where the exploration project is in a far better place than it was some years ago.  There is a good deal more interest, particularly in regard to security and so forth.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that he will come back to the House and debate the report with us?  Will he acknowledge that the report is an all-party report by a committee, the majority of whose members are Government TDs and Senators and that it was unanimously supported and adopted by the members of the committee?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I acknowledge that it is an all-party report.  I acknowledge also the seriousness with which the members of the committee went about their work.  I am aware of some of the submissions made to the committee.  I understand from the Chairman that it is a report of some merit and if Deputy Ferris says it will be published next Wednesday, I welcome that.  I assure the Deputy that it will be taken very seriously in this Department.  If it is his wish that the Oireachtas committee report be debated in the House, I am happy to see that matter decided by the Whips.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, and myself will be glad to participate in that debate.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	242	When the Minister was on this side of the House he would have known that many reports commissioned and produced by various committees were left on the shelf.  I hope he will give an undertaking that once we debate this report he will proactively implement its recommendations.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I am happy to commit to having a debate on the report in the House as soon as such may be organised.  The Deputy will have to appreciate that I have not yet received the report.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	244	The proposal to which the Deputy refers was made in a print media article that began with a statement that Ireland was about to sign away almost all of our resources on terms by far the worst in the developed world.  In reply I pointed out that both claims were factually wrong and demonstrated that the fiscal terms applying to profits from oil and gas production in Ireland were pitched at a level comparable with that in other similar European countries.  In addition, I explained that under the 2011 Atlantic margin licensing round, applications were only received for approximately 6% of the area on offer.  While the number of applications received was positive in comparison to the number received in previous licensing rounds, it still means that for the vast majority of Ireland's offshore, no exploration work is taking place.  Having established that the reasoning giving rise to the proposal was flawed, it follows that the proposal was without basis.The challenge for Ireland is not how to manage its natural resources but how to attract a sufficient level of exploration investment to establish our offshore oil and gas potential.  Even with our current fiscal regime which is deliberately aimed at attracting new investment, exploration levels remain very modest.If Ireland were to hand over a half share of its oil and gas resources to another country, apart from being an entirely daft proposal, it follows that the potential return that could be offered to incentivise oil companies to invest in exploration here would have to be reduced significantly.  At current levels, the incentive has delivered modest results.  If it were to be more than halved, that could end all exploration efforts in our offshore which would not be in our interests.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	245	While I would have liked to have tabled this question at the time the article in question was published, unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to do so.  However, the Minister's answer was interesting.  I do not subscribe to the simple school of thought that there is a substantial amount of oil and gas in Irish waters from which we could make loads of money.  The proposal which the Minister described as "daft" is an interesting one and should be explored.  Given that the State receives only a minuscule amount of money from exploration companies which find oil and gas in Irish waters, it is difficult to ascertain what are the benefits of the current approach.  Companies which find oil and gas in Irish waters are not required to land their finds in this country and may transport them elsewhere.  In such circumstances, the benefits to Ireland are minimal.  Would it not be worthwhile to discuss this issue with the Norwegian Government, given its extensive expertise and substantial investment in this area?  Surely it would be worth a try.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I presume the report to which Deputy Martin Ferris referred will result in the House discussing many of the issues Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan raises.  His question relates to the suggestion that "an offer of a half share of ownership be made to the Norwegian state in return for managing the natural resources in our territorial waters".  If he looks at the Marine Institute map of Ireland, he will find that more of this country's territory lies offshore than onshore.  I would not contemplate the notion of handing over half of our offshore natural resources to another country.I am not sure what is the point of the proposal, given that our problem is one of finding oil rather than managing our resources.  If we find oil, there is sufficient talent in the country to manage it.  The problem, however, is that the strike rate since the 1970s has been very disappointing.  We have had only three gas strikes, with one further strike in prospect, and no oil strikes.  How Norway comes into the equation is beyond me.  There are no similarities between Ireland and Norway in this regard, a view borne out by the submission the Norwegian ambassador made to the joint committee of which Deputy Ferris is a member.  Norway has a strike rate of approximately one in four and a uniquely advantageous geology.  Furthermore, the Norwegian Government refunds 78% of the cost of a dry well, so confident is it of strikes in its waters.  This confidence is also reflected in the tax rate applied to oil and gas in Norway.  If one drills dry wells, it does not matter whether the tax rate is 0%, 40% or 80% because it is still 0%, 40% or 80% of nothing.  Our problem has been one of getting exploration activity offshore in the hope it will be possible to make a find.  We do not need another country to do that for us.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	247	The Minister makes a relevant point when he notes that 80% or 40% of nothing is still nothing.  However, one can apply the same logic to the idea of giving a 50% share of something to Norway because, as matters stand, it would amount to 50% of nothing.  We could use the expertise developed in Norway and adopt the Norwegian approach to offshore exploration.  While I accept that Norwegian waters have more oil than Irish waters and that it is, therefore, easier to make finds in Norway, on the basis that a high percentage of nothing is nothing, why not explore the proposal and ascertain its potential?  Having done so, the Minister would then be entitled to describe it as daft.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	248	It is noteworthy that in the recent round of licensing which was, relatively speaking, more successful than previous rounds undertaken in the past decade, the Norwegian state oil company did not even submit a bid.  It is not an issue of Norway having skills that are not otherwise applied here.  The mistaken premise of the original article was that Norway and Ireland were comparable in terms of the potential for discovering hydrocarbons.  The 13 companies to which we awarded licences a few months ago have the necessary skills.  What we need is to get another 13 companies-----
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Does the Minister disagree with the Frank Fahey analogy?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	250	If one is drilling two wells per annum, the prospect of making finds can be compared to finding a needle in a haystack.  It is not a question of handing over to another country something that has, I hope, valuable potential for the State but of trying to strike the right balance to persuade exploration companies to come here.  We do not have the investment required to establish a State oil company which would engage in exploration and drilling.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	251	As part of the State assets disposal programme, the Government has decided with the troika on the sale of Bord Gáis Éireann's energy business.  Bord Gáis Energy is a dynamic and successful part of the Bord Gáis Éireann's business which has delivered real benefits for consumers as it has invested and grown in power generation and energy supply.  The sale of Bord Gáis Éireann's energy business will support the company and its employees to continue to grow, while enhancing competition in the energy market for the benefit of the economy and consumers.The Government has reiterated its commitment to retaining the gas networks and interconnectors in State ownership as strategic infrastructure which is fundamental to Ireland's security of energy supply and the economy.  Following the Government's decision on State asset disposals, a group comprising my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA has been tasked with progressing all policy, regulatory, legislative and financial issues to be addressed prior to the disposal of Bord Gáis Energy.  This work which is ongoing is taking full cognisance of the recent Government decision to establish Irish Water within the BGE group.  The decision reflects the Government's confidence that BGE's strong experience and capacities can be quickly deployed in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.My Department, NewERA and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in co-operation with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and BGE, will ensure the work of preparing Bord Gáis Energy for sale and establishing the water utility in State ownership within the BGE group are advanced in a fully complementary way and to schedule.  My Government colleagues and I are confident that BGE has the capacity to sustain its ongoing oversight and management of the gas networks, as well as working with the Government on the sale of Bord Gáis Energy at the same time.It is the Government's intention, agreed by the troika, that the asset disposal programme will be implemented in an orderly process over time in a way which will allow all policy regulatory and financial issues to be addressed in advance and ensures full value for the State.  In that context, it is the Government's collective plan to ensure the smooth implementation of the decisions to sell Bord Gáis Energy and establish Irish Water as part of the BGE group.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The Minister has stated the Government has its asset disposal policy, of which we are aware.  Will he give an undertaking that Irish Water, when established, will not form part of the Government's asset disposal programme any time in the future?  What other organisations or entities were considered in tandem with Bord Gáis for the roll-out of the water supply and water metering programme?  We do not have insider information on why Bord Gáis was selected by the Government.  How many other similar organisations were considered by it for the roll-out of the programme?  Can the Minister shed light on the process undertaken?  We know that there was no formal tendering process, but we are operating in a vacuum in respect of the decision made.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	253	There is no question of Irish Water being privatised.  The decision brought to the Cabinet by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government required the Government to make a choice between Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis.  At that stage of the process the Minister had narrowed it down to these two bodies.  The only decision the Government took was to select Bord Gáis and decide that there would be no privatisation of water services.  Contrary to what is stated in a great deal of material I have been reading, that is the only decision the Government made.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The awarding of contracts by State companies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for the individual companies in the first instance.  I have no function in this regard.  The code of practice for the governance of State bodies sets out clear procurement requirements.  It is the responsibility of boards to satisfy themselves that these requirements are adhered to.EU directives and national regulations impose legal obligations on public bodies in regard to advertising and the use of objective tendering procedures for awarding contracts above certain value thresholds.  Even in the case of procurement which might not be subject to the full scope of EU directives such as certain non-priority services or service concessions, the European Commission and the European Court of Justice have ruled that EU treaty principles must be observed.The implementation of national and European procurement requirements is an important element in the achievement of value for money in the State sector.  Boards of State companies are obliged to ensure there is an appropriate focus on good practice in purchasing and that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with procurement policy and guidelines.  More generally, public procurement legislation in the European Union is aimed at creating a common market by ensuring free movement of goods, persons, services and capital and promoting effective competition in the internal market.  The essential treaty principles include non–discrimination, equal treatment, transparency, mutual recognition, proportionality, freedom to provide service and freedom of establishment.  There is a strongly implied requirement to publicise contracts of significant value to a degree which allows parties in other member states the opportunity to express an interest or submit tenders.Information on procurement policy and general guidance on procurement matters is published by the national public procurement policy unit.  This can be viewed or downloaded from the national public procurement website.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I previously raised the issue of the awarding of a contract to Bord Gáis.  I received a report from Bord Gáis and a letter from the Minister this morning on the issue.  I thank him for his response, but my concerns remain.  The wider point is that large lucrative contracts in several State companies have been awarded to firms overseas.  I have no doubt that this will lead to significant job losses and the closure of long-standing Irish businesses dependant on these contracts.  Does the Minister agree that there ought to be preferential treatment for Irish companies applying for these contracts?  The current policy is definitely mitigating against the Government's stated objective of utilising existing public companies to maximise job creation opportunities.  It does not make sense, therefore, that a big company should take over resources from State companies and brings in its own personnel.  The consequence of such actions is that the dole queues are being added to.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I have raised with Bord Gáis more than once the matters raised by the Deputy in the House.  This has caused the company to communicate directly with him.  On the wider issue he raises, the fact remains that we are a member of the European Union.  To do what he asks would run contrary to the law.  Therefore, we cannot do what he suggests in terms of procurement.  Even if any of the companies was minded to do it, it would not be free to do what he requests.  Irish companies would suffer if this were to happen because they, too, are contending for and winning contracts outside Ireland.  This includes State companies such as the ESB and Bord na Móna which are very successful in this area and have built a very interesting talent bank in engineering and other skills.  Within EU law on freedom of movement it is not possible to restrict recruitment by such contractors to within this jurisdiction only.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The Deputy is in possession of as much information as I am.  This is a giant international company the services of which were procured in the normal way by Bord Gáis Éireann.Bord Gáis Éireann has gone to considerable difficulty to persuade Deputy Ferris and myself that it did everything above board, which is not to say some of the matters Deputy Ferris brought to my attention are, and were, not of the utmost gravity.  Most of the events happened some time ago.  This is a giant multinational company and the service Bord Gáis Éireann was recruiting does not relate to the same territory, personnel or anything like that.  Bord Gáis Éireann is convinced the company in question is professionally well equipped, has done a good job and was procured in accordance with procurement guidelines.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I am very aware that many families are experiencing financial hardship including the cost of heating their homes, due to the current economic difficulties.I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.The Government is, however, taking a range of actions to address the challenge of affordable energy for vulnerable families.  The Government's strategy for affordable energy in Ireland was launched by me last November.  The strategy sets out our plans for enhancing the affordability of energy for low-income households.  The strategy was developed by the interdepartmental group on affordable energy and includes 48 actions that will be implemented over the life of the strategy.  The interdepartmental group on affordable energy has established subgroups to work on particular dimensions of that strategy and these include the immediate priority of revising eligibility criteria for the warmer homes scheme and a pilot programme to assess the feasibility of an area-based approach to delivery of the scheme.It is worth noting that in the past ten years €2 billion has been distributed in energy supports under the national fuel scheme and the household benefits package, while €80 million has been spent on energy efficiency improvements in vulnerable homes.  Permanent improvements to the thermal efficiency of houses are the most cost effective means of addressing energy poverty.  More immediately, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, continues to administer, on behalf of my Department, Warmer Homes which is free of charge to eligible applicants.  With more than 81,000 homes refurbished to date, 2012 will see a further 17,000 low-income households benefit from energy efficiency upgrades.  I have allocated just over €17 million to the warmer homes scheme this year.  This allocation underlines the Government's commitment to the affordable energy priority.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I thank the Minister.  He will be aware that the Irish League of Credit Unions recently conducted a survey of its membership.  The survey was widely reported and was a credible piece of research.  Some of the findings related to energy costs.  One in four respondents said they cannot cope with rising energy prices, 15% said they had to dip into their savings to deal with rising energy costs and 8% said they were unable to cover their household bills.  Some very stark facts and figures were disclosed in the research.We know from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, that between November 2010 and November 2011 the price of natural gas rose by between 12% and 20%, gas oil rose by 21%, bulk propane went up by 16% and kerosene by 28%.  The cost of solid fuel fell by 3% and that of briquettes rose by 1%.The cost to householders has been enormous in that period and people are clearly struggling with regard to it.  The Minister mentioned that he published a fuel poverty strategy that lists 48 action points to be addressed.  What progress has been made in the implementation of that action plan?  Since he published the action plan in November of last year, has the Minister seen a tangible drop in any of the prices I have quoted?  If not, when can we expect to see such a drop?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The primary focus of the strategy is to improve thermal efficiency in homes that are at risk.  It is not focused on bringing down the price of gas or oil.  Gas and oil are imported into the country.  We are price takers and there is very little we can do about that.  We can, however, reduce our consumption and address the inefficient circumstances in which many people live.The Deputy is correct.  There is a real problem of fuel poverty.  I entirely accept that.  We are fortunate to have had a particularly mild winter at a time when the price of gas has risen across the western world.  Different factors are at play in the United States.  As price takers, we are at the receiving end of all of that.If the Deputy focuses on the rationale behind the affordable energy strategy he will recognise that we will get best bang for our buck if homes are properly insulated and thermally efficient.  I am afraid that is, generally, not the case.  The work done so far, and the examination of it by the SEAI, shows how successful that work has been.  Because of the mild winter it appears there has been a fall-off in applications, which is surprising.  That fall-off is also affecting the warmer homes scheme, where there is no charge.  The work is done by the State on homes that need it.  Even in that area, there has been a fall-off.  We will have a meeting on that scheme later this evening, because there is no doubt it is the best and most productive use of taxpayers' money.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	262	The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, administers the workplaces efficiency fund as part of the better energy programme.  The better energy programme is in line with the key criteria governing the Government's investment priorities and is consistent with the programme for Government objectives.   It is also consistent with the Government's Action Plan for Jobs which includes specific actions to promote energy efficiency in businesses to reduce costs and enhance competitiveness.The Government has committed significant Exchequer funding of €76 million to the better energy programme in 2012, including €8 million to the workplaces efficiency fund.The SEAI is promoting energy efficiency across all business sectors with specific supports for small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, to assist them in saving energy and reducing energy costs.  To date, approximately 2,000 SMEs have registered with SEAI.  Each of these businesses has received advice and mentoring which generally involves a site visit and follow-up support from an energy adviser.  This is a free service and I would urge all SMEs to avail of the advice and supports.The SEAI programme for SMEs also provides tailored training packages to SMEs to suit their individual needs.  SEAI provides a range of advice on technologies and relevant practical case studies through the programme.Last year, the better energy workplaces programme successfully supported energy efficiency measures for many businesses and institutions across the country.  Some 85 specific projects were completed across all sectors.  The €11 million fund generated annual energy savings of €11 million and leveraged a further €34 million of investment in energy efficiency, representing an excellent return on investment for the Exchequer, real savings for the businesses themselves, and economic activity in its own right.Of the 85 projects supported, 21 were classified as SMEs.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The SEAI is also working in partnership with Enterprise Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and others, including ISME, to ensure their clients are fully aware of the services offered to SMEs by the SEAI.  There is co-operation between the EPA, offering waste and water efficiency assistance, and the SEAI, providing energy efficiency assistance, to ensure Irish businesses receive the best advice and support to deliver efficiencies and savings for their bottom lines, thus improving their competitiveness and sustaining jobs.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	263	It is apparent much more tolerance is being shown this year compared to last year by energy suppliers to people and especially small businesses which are in difficulty, which is to be welcomed.  That is the situation from my knowledge of what is happening.  Coming on top of the downturn, energy costs are probably among the most crippling for small and medium businesses in terms of their survival.  The Minister outlined in a previous reply the level of increase in energy costs, for example, 21%, 29%, 16% and 28% in the various fuels available.  The only fuel in respect of which there was a reduction - of 3% - was solid fuel.  I cannot emphasise sufficiently the importance, particularly in the current climate, of necessary supports to ensure small businesses survive.  Small businesses are especially important in peripheral areas for the fabric of society we are trying to maintain.  They need all the support they can get.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I agree with the Deputy that the supplier companies have shown an understanding of current circumstances and, in the case of some small and medium enterprises, SMEs, energy costs are particularly onerous in terms of their running costs.  In addition, I was happy to put in place the protocol for domestic users where there was an undertaking that there would not be disconnections during the winter provided people eithered install a meter or signed up to a pay plan.  Where there has been a take-up of these options, the approach has been very successful.The Deputy is correct that energy costs weigh heavily on many SMEs.  The planned scheme by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to which I referred, is worthy and will prove useful to SMEs.  The SMEs which have participated have pointed to the impact it has had on their operating costs.  There is a great deal of room for greater energy efficiency in SMEs throughout the country.  That is the area in which savings can be made and businesses can thrive as a result.  The SEAI scheme has shown a capacity to leverage private sector funding also.  I would like to be in a position to put more money into the scheme but in current circumstances that is very difficult.  However, it is one of the options we are considering because it would make a significant contribution for many SMEs which find the energy component of their costs very difficult, given current world market prices.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Responsibility for the regulation of premium rate telephone numbers and their advertising, including those referred to in the Deputy's question, is a matter for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The BAI and ComReg are independent statutory bodies and as such, I have no direct role in the matter.The enactment of the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010 transferred responsibility for the regulation of premium rate services, PRS, in the State from the Regulator of Premium Rate Telecommunications Services Limited, RegTel, to ComReg.  In relation to the regulation of premium rate services, ComReg, as the competent authority in this jurisdiction, has a code of practice in place.  The code derives from the original RegTel code and has been operated by ComReg since July 2010, pending the further development of a code in this area.  Service providers of premium rate telecommunications services are required to comply with the provisions of the code of practice.  There are a number of specific provisions in the code which are pertinent to the advertisement of premium rate chat services.  Chat line services of the type to which the Deputy refers are not defined as sexual entertainment services, but rather as virtual chat services.  However, the code of practice addresses services of a sexual nature, in section 8.4.  Consequently, it includes provisions governing the promotion of such services.  It also stipulates, under section 5.2 and, in particular, section 5.2.3, that service providers must ensure services are not used in any way to promote or facilitate prostitution.  Compliance with the code is a matter for ComReg.  Having considered the Deputy's concerns, I will request that it inform him directly of any compliance measures it has taken to date under the code, both generally and specifically with regard to these advertisements.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The BAI has responsibility for certain types of advertising rules.  Section 8(9) of its general commercial communications code, GCCC, makes general provisions for premium rate telecommunications services and requires that commercial communications for such services comply with Irish and European legislation and the rules, regulations and codes of practice issued from time to time.  The GCCC also makes a more general provision in relation to matters of offence, harm and dignity.  A range of rules under section 3.2 of the code deal with these issues.  I note the strong concerns the Deputy has expressed on this matter which I will relay to the BAI and ComReg.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply which he did not get the chance to conclude.  The inspiration behind the question is that often as I sit at home late at night awaiting what for me and many others is a very challenging political programme, I see young scantily dressed girls on TV3 encouraging and inviting people to participate with them by way of a call centre.  I make no bones about it, given my information, that I believe this is a cover for prostitution.  From the information available, prostitution is rife in the country and a service is readily available in every city, town and village.  It is inextricably linked with sex trafficking, with which we have a serious problem.  One can only imagine the horror in people's lives and those of their families for those embroiled in sex slavery and sex trafficking.The matter cannot be discussed without considering the knock-on effects.  The Garda in Clondalkin is seeking help following an attack on a young girl in my constituency.  The Minister is well aware of the situation and I fully support him.  I do not accept for one moment that what I see on TV3 every night is not a sexual entertainment service.  I accept that ComReg is the relevant authority in the matter and that it is competent in achieving compliance with the legislation.  However, we are the legislative authority and could perhaps be of assistance were we to empower ComReg by providing new or additional legislation that would be helpful in dealing with this serious matter, about which I feel most uncomfortable.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	267	It has not yet been established that the BAI code is ineffective.  The issue raised by the Deputy concerns whether so-called chat lines are, in fact, as he put it, a cover for prostitution.  I find it difficult to think of anything positive that one could say about the advertisements in question.  They are demeaning of women and, unfortunately, as the Deputy said, there is an issue affecting this as well as every other country of young women being trafficked.  It was believed, even at the time the Bill on human trafficking was enacted, that it was an issue that affected other member states but not this country to the same extent.  However, the evidence made available since suggests it is a matter of concern in this jurisdiction also.  Now that the Deputy has raised the matter I will be pleased to draw the attention of ComReg to the issues he has raised.  If it is his conviction - I will not press him on the source of his information - that the chat lines are a cover for prostitution, it would be appropriate to refer the advertisements to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

This research is in the form of a desk-based study carried out by the University of Aberdeen.  While managing the carrying out of the study is a matter for the EPA, I understand from the EPA that it expects to be in a position to publish the report within the next two weeks, possibly even next week.The EPA proposes to commission further, more extensive research on hydraulic fracturing in 2012 and representatives from the Department and the EPA are developing the scope for that further study.  The specification for this further more detailed research will be finalised after there has been an opportunity to consider the output from the University of Aberdeen.The question of a Green Paper is one issue, but it would be more important at this stage to obtain the greatest possible amount of detailed scientific advice on what is happening on hydraulic fracturing right around the world, as is envisaged with the proposed second study.  Until the results of that study are available and have been considered, I will not make any decision on any application proposing the use of hydraulic fracturing.

Indeed, a number of local authorities have passed motions banning it within their administrative areas, and that is all well reported.I did not hear one part of the Minister of State's reply.  Will he publish the report as soon as it is available?  Will it be made available to the public?

It is up to the EPA to publish it.  We expect that the EPA will publish it within the next two weeks, possibly as early as next week.The important point to bear in mind on the other side of the argument is that Tamboran Resources believes there is approximately 41 billion cubic meters of reserves in unconventional gas in that part of Ireland.

It is probably one of the most contentious forms of drilling or extracting natural resources for the greater good.  I read reports recently regarding fracking that took place in Wales, the consequences of which were mini-earthquakes.  It has certainly been implied that such was the cause of it.Will the EPA takes cognisance of the surveys carried out in France, and also the surveys that are being carried out in parts of America where, in many instances, they are revisiting areas where fracking has taken place?There is an interesting article in "Rolling Stone", which I do not know whether the Minister of State reads.

It is not a Department report, even though we requested the EPA to carry out the work, and it is up to the EPA to publish it.  It is a desk-top study.  It is really only a research document looking at what is there at present and bringing that data together.The EPA intends to commission a further much more detailed report into all aspects of what is called unconventional gas or fracking.It is, as Deputy Ferris stated, a seismic event anyway by its nature.  It fractures.  In England, around Blackpool, it caused a mini-earthquake.  It was 1.1 to 2 on the Richter scale, which is very small.  Nevertheless, it did happen.The key point is that we must gather all of the science and facts available.  One of the important reports that will be coming available at the end of this year is the American Environmental Protection Report into hydraulic fracturing in the United States.  That will probably be the benchmark for future studies because they are looking into the issues.If one looked at the film, "Gasland", one the key images is where a person turns on their tap and lights the water.  Recently, the EPA in the United States looked into that and stated that the methane in that water supply was not caused by hydraulic fracturing.  This is a fantasy.  One might not like to believe it, but that is what they state.It is terribly important, before anything happens, that all of the full facts are known.  As the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, myself and the Department are saying, nothing will happen, and we will not allow anybody to commence production of hydraulic fracturing at this stage, unless and until all of the many and detailed national and international studies are looked at and all of the environmental aspects are detailed and fully examined.

The success of Bord Gáis Energy demonstrates BGE's capacity to develop new and efficient businesses for the benefit of Irish consumers as well as for the State, as the shareholder.The recent decision to establish Irish Water within the group reflects the Government's confidence in BGE.  BGE's experience in the key areas of raising finance, operating and investing in critical network infrastructure and delivering excellent customer service, will be effectively deployed in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, have advised that an implementation strategy for Irish Water is being developed by his Department.  The strategy will be finalised over the next month or so in collaboration with BGE, all relevant Departments, including my Department, as well as the local authorities, and with the advice of NewERA.In parallel, a group comprising my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA is working to progress all policy, regulatory, legislative and financial, to be addressed as part of preparing for the disposal of Bord Gáis Energy.The Departments, NewERA and BGE are fully cognisant of the need to ensure that the work on the sale of Bord Gáis Energy and the establishment of the water company are progressed concurrently and to schedule.  The Government will be briefed on a regular basis on progress on both fronts.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	281	It has been stated, in the announcements and communications to date, that it is envisaged that Bord Gáis will have the individual water metering and billing system up and running by 2014.  What is the plan B in a scenario where that deadline is not met, that is, that all of the homes are not metered and in a position where they can be individually billed?My party notes the disparity between what the executive engineer of Dublin City Council states and the official line from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in terms of the number of houses for which there may need to be a flat charge.  If the main body of houses are not fully metered by 2014, is it the intention to proceed with a flat-rate charge?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, wearing his hat in the other Department, is more competent in this area than I am.  The fact remains that, as Deputy Niall Collins stated, this is no more than rumour and speculation.  The Government has made no decision other than that there will be no privatisation of water, there will be a State water company whose name is not yet decided, and Bord Gáis is charged with bringing proposals to us in this respect.  It is entirely putting the cart before the horse to speculate beyond that.  Bord Gáis has a blank page and knows what has to be done.  It made a very considered pitch for the task, as did Bord na Móna, and, as a result, the company has a great deal of skills and knowledge to bring to the job.  When it comes back with its proposals, either the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, or the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, will bring a plan to Government.  It is pure speculation and rumour in the interim as to what may or may not happen or whether the system will be ready in 2014 or whatever.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 30 together.The programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the television licence fee in light of the existing and projected convergence of technologies and to transforming the television licence into a household-based public broadcasting charge to be applied to all eligible households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content or services.  In line with this commitment, my Department is involved in the ongoing analysis and policy development work necessary in advance of the implementation of any new charge of this nature.Although subject to a degree of evasion, the existing television licence fee system has provided a stable funding base for our public service broadcasters.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to achieve their public service objectives while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.  The overall aim of public service broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on public service broadcasters, which are firmly grounded in legislation passed by this House, and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound and Vision scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and minority interest programming is strongly promoted.Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing it will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented on foot of the review must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content.  It is also important that any new system of funding should recognise the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and services and their pervasiveness in today's society.  Publicly funded public service broadcasting services and content are now available on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices, including radio, television, smartphones, personal computers, laptops and many other devices.  In fact, access is not dependent on the ownership of a device.The replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of a device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and much of the detail has yet to be worked out.  This includes identifying the most appropriate method for collecting the charge and the manner in which issues such as exemptions and enforcement should be dealt with.  In this regard, my Department is considering proposals to engage independent consultants to assist in progressing this work over the coming year.  At this point, however, I can state that the charge will be device-independent, will replace the current licence fee and that all households and businesses will be subject to it, except for those that are specifically exempted.  The issue of exemptions will be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, it is my expectation that the current exemptions in regard to pensioners and those entitled to the household benefit package will continue to apply.On the question of the charge being Exchequer neutral, a large proportion of TG4's funding is Exchequer-based, with the remainder coming mainly from licence fee revenues and some commercial revenue.  No decision has been made to alter this position.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I heard the Minister being interviewed about the broadcasting charge on "Morning Ireland" some days ago.  He was at pains to stress that it is not a new charge.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	285	We have enough problems.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	286	However, it is a new charge to a person who has not had to pay it to date but may now fall into the eligible category.  The Minister might have been gilding the lily a little in this regard.  Is it his intention to collect more revenue under the broadcasting charge than is the case by way of the television licence fee?  Has he any plan or proposal to deal with the allocation of that funding?  As it stands, RTE receives 92% of licence fee revenue, with the remainder disbursed in various directions, including to TG4 and the Sound and Vision fund.  There is a case to be made that some of the independent broadcasters merit a greater share of the funds, which is something the Government should consider.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The broadcasting charge will be a replacement for the television licence fee, not a new charge.  When the Deputy says it will amount to a new charge for some people, that is true in so far as it refers to those who are cheating.  The extent of evasion is currently of the order of €25 million.  On the question of whether I hope to raise more revenue under the new system, that depends on what impact we can make on that €25 million, that is, how much of it we can bring back into the fold.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	288	That is a new term.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Anybody already paying the television licence fee has nothing to fear.  If we do manage to bring in additional revenue, we might even be able to decrease the charge.  I am sure that would be applauded by Members on the benches opposite.I understand some 7.5% of licence fee revenue goes to the Sound and Vision fund and some €10 million to TG4.  I acknowledge that some of the independent broadcasters provide important public service content.  During yesterday's Topical Issue debate I noted that RTE is projecting a bottom line deficit for the end of the year of some €50 million.  That is an enormous sum and is clearly not sustainable.  The legal impositions on RTE in terms of aspiring to deliver a quality public broadcasting service are severe.  In addition, there are serious challenges confronting it as a consequence of the collapse of advertising and the level of evasion of the television licence fee.  We are proceeding with our review, but the process is more complicated than one might imagine.  When the day comes that we know exactly how many houses there are in this country and where they are located, it will be a major breakthrough.  We are working on that.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products.  It has been the policy objective of successive Governments to promote price competition and consumer choice.Previous surveys have shown that prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products correlate with the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  Prices at the pump reflect the volatile market price as well as transportation costs, trends in euro-dollar exchange rates and other operating costs, as well as the impact of taxation on oil products.I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is an independent statutory body.Prices in the retail electricity market for both domestic and business customers are now fully deregulated, as are those for business customers in the retail gas market.  Since last October, CER only regulates the gas price charged by Bord Gáis Energy to domestic consumers.  Prices charged to electricity customers, domestic and business, and to business gas customers are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the energy suppliers.I am committed to working with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation and with the business and energy sector to ensure the costs of energy for business are as competitive as possible.  This includes working with SMEs as well as large energy users on energy efficiency measures which deliver cost savings and support competitiveness and jobs.  I urge all businesses to engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to access the authority's energy efficiency support programmes.

These are operational matters for EirGrid, which is the independent statutory State body responsible for the development and maintenance of the national electricity transmission system.EirGrid is fully committed to public consultation with local communities and all stakeholders on its transmission network development projects.  At the recent launch of the Grid Link project which is the construction of the high voltage power line from Munster to Leinster, EirGrid announced a comprehensive consultation process on the project.  This is a €500 million investment in refurbishment of the transmission link from Cork to Kildare.EirGrid's extensive public consultation process, now getting underway, is an essential part of the technical and environmental assessments which are required as part of the planning application to An Bord Pleanála, which is scheduled to be submitted in 2015.  EirGrid's structured approach to full public consultation is critical to the comprehensive route selection process for the Grid Link project.  In keeping with best international practice EirGrid will undertake regular reviews at all key stages of the project to test key technology assumptions.  This will take account of potential advances in technology.The Grid Link project will deliver security of electricity supply in the south and east, will underpin the development of renewable energy and will ensure that demand in the region can be met, thus underpinning economic investment, jobs and growth.  The Government wants to give a strong consistent message to Irish business and multinationals, and our citizens, that Ireland's electricity networks are robust, modern, comprehensive and safe.  The investment programmes of EirGrid are critical to ensuring that the national energy infrastructure is maintained and built cost effectively to the highest standards and with full regard for environmental, safety and health requirements and the needs of local communities.Written Answers follow Adjournment.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I welcome the publication of the strategic plan from the Irish Prison Service last Monday and congratulate the Director General of the Irish Prison Service, Michael Donnellan, and his team for putting it together in such a short period of time since his appointment.  His appointment as director is significant.  He comes with a progressive background from the Probation Service and the experience of his work there will fit into the job in the Prison Service.  The provision of in-cell sanitation in every cell within three and a half years is to be welcomed.  Anyone who has seen the reality of a prison cell has a different understanding of this issue.I strongly welcome the drug-free units and it would be remiss not to draw attention to the work in Mountjoy Prison, where great progress was made in recent years for relatively low capital investments by using people's ideas and making it virtually impossible to transport drugs into Mountjoy.  I particularly welcome the moving of 16 and 17 year olds out of St. Patrick's Institution.  The Minister and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and all involved in that decision, if they do nothing else for the rest of their term, should be rightly proud if they achieve that by the end of their term in office.  In terms of using prison as a place for rehabilitation and learning, the policy of having 16 and 17 year olds in St. Patrick's Institution cannot work.  The Minister enjoys the full support of this side of the House in pursuing that policy as soon as possible.I am concerned, however, given resource constraints at the moment, about the plan for temporary release of prisoners into community service and projects which, unlike some of the reports in the media, is not a huge leap from what is happening at present.  The formalisation of the scheme, however, will require resources for the Probation Service in particular and the Irish Prison Service.Those who are going to be released will be deemed not to be a safety risk.  I am happy to accept that language but the Minister has commissioned a report on the manner in which the prisoner was transferred to Loughan House.  Balls get dropped.  I know there is a new report but what procedures exist to deem what is a safety risk?  The Minister said non-violent prisoners will be released.  Are we talking about prisoners who are non-violent while serving their sentences or a person who has committed a non-violent offence?  Will a prisoner who committed a violent offence be released?A pilot programme involving 85 prisoners is in place.  Could the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality get a presentation in private session on the report on that programme to see how it is working?My final point relates to the role of victims in this process.  Every crime, regardless of its scale, has a victim.  Will victims' families be involved in the consultation process relating to the pre-release programme?  The last thing we need is for the victim of a crime to come across the individual who perpetrated it while he or she is involved in some element of a community service programme, perhaps working in the victim's neighbourhood or outside his or her home.  Would it be possible to formalise the role of victims in the pre-release process in order that they might be fully involved?  One of the major shocks for me in respect of Loughan House was that once the prisoner had been jailed, the victim's family was completely out of the equation.  I know there is much better awareness of the needs of victims' families in the aftermath of that incident.  Perhaps that awareness needs to permeate the entire system, particularly as we move towards the formalisation of the pre-release process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and his very constructive comments.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue which has been a topic of some discussion for a number of days.As the Deputy is aware, on Monday last I launched the new three year strategic plan for the Irish Prison Service.  The plan contains a new mission statement and vision for the service.  That mission is to "provide safe and secure custody, dignity of care and rehabilitation to prisoners for safer communities".  The plan also contains a vision for the service of "a safer community through excellence in a prison service built on respect for human dignity".  The plan has the potential to deliver a safer and more secure environment for prisoners and staff and enhance prisoner rehabilitation through greater involvement in sentence planning and structured activities.  It can also be a catalyst for bringing about cultural change in prisons.The plan's key objectives are: increasing public safety by maintaining safe and secure custody for all those committed by the courts and reducing reoffending and improving prisoner rehabilitation through the development of a multi-agency approach to offending; ensuring Ireland's compliance with domestic and international human rights obligations and best practice; delivering reform and implementing change in accordance with the public service agreement and the integrated reform plan for the justice and equality sector.  The plan includes several concrete and practical, if ambitious, targets for the next three years.  Many of these objectives give effect to commitments given in the programme for Government and include the elimination of slopping out across the prison estate; the replacement of outdated accommodation and facilities in Mountjoy, Cork and Limerick prisons; ending the detention of juveniles at St. Patrick's Institution; the creation of drug-free units; and the enhancement of current programmes, including accredited education and vocational training for prisoners.The Irish Prison Service is setting out to re-engineer the prison system to give further effect to the principles of normalisation, progression and reintegration.  This is done through work training and education but also through the work of the medical, dental and other health care services, the psychology service and the chaplaincy, not forgetting the inputs from the Probation Service and voluntary and community organisations.On many occasions in this House I have been asked about prison overcrowding.  Chronic overcrowding and all the problems that come with it are the result of the failure of previous Governments to provide an appropriate number of places across the prison estate.  This is an issue the current Administration is determined to address.  Already, after only 14 months in government, arrangements have been put in place for the provision of a 300 space wing at the Midlands Prison which is likely to open in September or early October.  Plans are under way for the provision of a new prison in Cork.  The capital plan funding allocation for the Irish Prison Service building programme for 2012 also provides for the continuation of the refurbishment and in-cell sanitation project at Mountjoy Prison.A pilot community return project commenced in October last in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall project review group.  The project which is run by the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service provides for earned early temporary release to be offered to offenders who pose no threat to society in return for supervised community service.  The project has engaged 85 prisoners and proved to be very successful.  It is now planned to roll it out nationally.  In reply to the specific query raised by the Deputy, I am in a position to state a review will be carried out when the project is complete.  I will be happy to share the information from that review with the Deputy in the format he suggested, namely, via a briefing to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  To date, four of the 85 prisoners involved in the project have been returned to prison for not complying with the conditions laid down.  The perception is that the project is working successfully.  However, a full review must be carried out of its workings upon completion.  Under the new proposal, at any one time a maximum of 150 prisoners will be engaged with the scheme.  In the three year lifetime of the plan, up to 1,200 prisoners will participate.  It will not be the case, as has been suggested in some of the more interesting media reports, that during this period there will be 1,200 prisoners on such structured release.The potential benefits of the programme are obvious.  Instead of releasing large numbers of prisoners on temporary release, without any assessment, in an unstructured manner, we will have a structured programme involving carefully selected and motivated prisoners.  The community return programme is restricted to suitably assessed prisoners who are serving sentences of more than one and less than eight years and who have served at least 50% of their sentences.  The overriding consideration in the operation of the programme is that of public safety.The following factors are taken into account in considering the suitability of a prisoner for temporary release to participate in the project: the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served relates; the sentence concerned and any recommendations made by the court in respect of the sentence imposed; the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released; the person's previous criminal record; the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release; the extent of the prisoner's engagement with therapeutic services while in custody; and conduct while in custody.It has been the practice of previous Governments to release prisoners before their full term of imprisonment has been completed.  The community return project provides a structure and an assessment process in respect of specific objectives to be achieved in connection with such releases.  Prison must not be merely a warehouse to contain convicted offenders for a period of time before releasing them back into the community to reoffend.  Our rates of recidivism are too high and we must take action to reduce them.  We must innovate and do things differently in order to reduce the unacceptable level of recidivism and reoffending.  By doing this we will provide greater protection from criminality for the community in general.I again thank the Deputy giving me the opportunity to address this matter in the House.  On the specific issue he raised in respect of the victims of crime, he will be aware of the commitment in the programme for Government regarding the introduction of a Bill to detail in law with the protections available to such victims.  Developments within the European Union may result in a victims' of crime measure that will apply across all of the member states.  If such a measure is directly applicable, we will not be obliged to publish our own legislation.  It is likely that legislation to go hand in hand with this measure will be produced and that it will address issues relating to victims in the context of prescribing their rights and entitlements in respect of the information which should be made available to them.

Given that Ireland will hold the Presidency of the Union next year, will he seek to champion the role victims should play in sentence management?  We need to re-imagine our approach to this matter.  The Minister referred to re-engineering the process.  There is a need to include victims in it.Has the Minister determined whether additional resources will have to be made available to the Probation Service?  In that context, he has indicated that only 150 prisoners will be involved in the scheme at any one time.  This suggests the projects envisaged will be short-term in nature.  Will the Minister provide some details of the kind of projects being undertaken as part of the pilot programme?  I am somewhat concerned about the practicality of having 150 people at a time engaged in a scheme which will ultimately involve 1,200 people over three years.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	296	On the very first occasion on which I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, attended a meeting of the Council of Ministers I raised the issue of the victims of crime.  Commissioner Reding has produced a proposal which is under consideration by the technical committees and which was the subject of an initial discussion at a meeting of the Council of Ministers.  In the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency, I have made it clear that there will be two major priorities in the justice area, the first of which is to substantially advance across Europe the project relating to the victims of crime.  If we do not manage to complete the putting in place of the proposed legal provision in this regard, at the very least we will progress it to a very advanced stage in order that it will come into play at some point during 2013.The second issue is to prioritise the seizure of criminal assets.  On the resources issue, I am perfectly satisfied the Probation Service will have the resources available to it for this particular project.  There are several individuals under existing legislation currently engaged in community service.  The Probation Service, under the leadership of Michael Donnellan who heads up the Prison Service, was able to make the arrangements to operate the pilot programme with 85 prisoners.  I do not have major concerns that this will give rise to any issues.  Provision of this programme is, in fact, a saving to taxpayers.  Instead of appropriate prisoners who pose no risk to the community being kept in jail for an extended period, they will be released from prison and be under the supervision of the Probation Service while doing community work to the benefit of local communities.There is a double plus in this.  While it will impose some additional obligations on the Probation Service, it will reduce the costs to the Prison Service of keeping people in the prison system in circumstances where it no longer serves a purpose.  This project will be very carefully rolled out.  It will be as carefully rolled out as was the pilot project.  Within the Prison Service, those engaged in the project and the director general of the Prison Service are aware of my views to ensure no individual who poses a risk to the community is released under this project.  There will be some individuals who will not have any possibility of being engaged in this project.  I believe we have to start doing things differently, and that involves not just this project.The media attention of this project has been interesting.  It has been misrepresented as suddenly releasing 1,200 people from our Prison Service.  What everyone is losing sight of is that we release a substantial number of people every year from our Prison Service, having completed three quarters of their sentence because they automatically get 25% remission.  We need to do things more intelligently, reduce expenditure where we can, benefit communities and re-equip individuals to work within their communities.  The great benefit of the structured release system is that it is envisaged that it would not just deal with community service.  Part of the condition of the release will be that, where necessary, the individual will co-operate with the psychiatric services where assistance is needed or engage with supports with regard to drug abuse or alcohol addiction.  It is envisaged this will be a structured temporary release programme that is substantially better than what we have had previously.I must apologise that I cannot take the next item.  My good colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will deal with it because I am supposed to be in the Seanad at 4 o'clock for a Private Members' Bill.
#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	297	Earlier this week the Central Statistics Office, CSO, released the most up-to-date crime statistics for the period 2006 to 2010.  These statistics contained some positive news.  For example, the detection rate for drug offences stood at 90%, for murder at 83% and for weapons and explosive offences at 90%.  This is good news and reflects the excellent work done by members of An Garda Síochána.  The one glaring exception to these high detection rates was in the area of burglary and related offences.  Of the 25,377 incidents of burglary recorded in 2010, only one in four was detected by the Garda.  Moreover, only one in 12, or 2,000 cases, led to a conviction.  This issue is of particular interest to me as a Dublin Deputy with the Dublin metropolitan region accounting for over 40% of all incidents of burglary, with Dublin South-Central showing the highest per capita figures with 1,261 burglaries per 100,000 people.It is important to consider several points about the nature of burglaries.  Most instances occur in private family homes.  For many people, burglary is the only form of crime which they will ever directly encounter.  It is also one of the most intrusive and invasive forms of crime.  It can be most distressing and disturbing for the families affected.  Most colleagues will agree that it often changes people's perception of their own home, sometimes forever.  The impact of burglaries on the victims must not be underestimated.Burglary can be considered an opportunistic crime, often committed by people starting out in crime.  The CSO statistics reflect this with a large number of convictions of young men in particular.  Fear of being caught is the only real deterrent to this problem.  With only one in four cases detected and only one in 12 leading to a conviction, the fear of being caught is far smaller for burglary than other crimes.  The key to apprehending burglars and creating a real deterrent is to ensure adequate forensic work is carried out.  Unfortunately, in many instances this vital work is not carried out.  I know this from many cases of burglary in my area and this is further borne out by these statistics.  Forensic work is the foundation of detection.  It secures the evidence necessary to bring people to court and to secure a conviction.  Without it, the entire investigative effort collapses.  People, both criminals and victims, are aware that adequate forensic work is not carried out in many instances.  This further reduces the deterrent for criminals, increases instances of burglary and leads to statistics such as those released this week.Gardaí often fail to pay sufficient attention to patterns of burglary.  Clear evidence and patterns arise in the commission of burglary.  Consistencies can emerge in the techniques used by the individuals involved as well as the homes they target, how they travel and how they dispose of stolen goods.  Unfortunately, not enough knowledge is gained from studying these patterns.  This needs to be changed to raise detection rates.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who has had to attend the Seanad.  He welcomes this opportunity to comment on recently published crime figures.The crime statistics overview published this week by the CSO relates to the period 2006 to 2010 and includes a range of additional information not included in previous releases.  These figures cover the period in office of the past two Fianna Fáil-led Governments.  The most recent crime figures relate to 2011, which were published by the CSO on 30 March last.  These most recent statistics show a decrease in most types of crime during 2011, including homicide, assault, criminal damage, drug and public order offences.  Taken together, this overall decrease represents a substantial achievement for law enforcement and crime prevention.The Minister is concerned at the increase in the number of burglaries reflected in the latest CSO figures and welcomes the fact that An Garda Síochána is responding effectively to this development.  In so far as the specific question of detection rates is concerned, the most recent CSO analysis shows a detection rate for burglary in the region of 25% for 2010.  It is important to note detection rates vary according to the nature of the crime which is in line with international experience.  Detection rates are often found to be lower for certain offences such as burglaries and some other property crimes as these generally only come to light after the event and after the offender has left the scene.  These offences are inherently more difficult to investigate than some others.  While our statistical system is not directly comparable with that of other countries such as the UK, for example, the difficulties presented in detecting burglaries are reflected in the fact that the detection rate for burglaries in England and Wales in 2010-2011 was recorded as 13%.Notwithstanding the investigative challenges presented, however, the Garda is responding effectively.  The Deputy will be aware the Garda Commissioner has recently announced the introduction of a wide range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries.  This operation, Operation Fiacla, is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries throughout the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the courts.  Operation Fiacla is intelligence-driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda region in support of this operation to target suspect offenders, disrupt their activities and secure their attendance before the courts.  These initiatives will optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management will ensure all personnel, community policing units, local traffic forces, regional support and other specialised units are fully briefed on the initiative, with divisional crime management teams playing a key role in co-ordinating implementation.Prevention is also a key component in tackling burglary and the national crime prevention unit, NCPU, and crime prevention officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary crime and the opportunity to commit burglary.  These specially trained officers are skilled at identifying environmental design risks and advise on ways to reduce opportunities to commit burglary and other property crime.  The NCPU has designed a number of crime prevention advice leaflets, including advice on home security and burglary prevention through a step-by-step checklist.  These leaflets and the checklist are available on the Garda website.Today the Garda Commissioner is launching the national Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign.  This important campaign will highlight a range of key issues, in particular burglary prevention.  The primary objective of this campaign is to engage with and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety.  In addition to the campaign being launched today, a further campaign will take place in September.  In addition to these community-based initiatives, the "Crime Call" television programme is broadcast once a month to an average audience of 400,000 viewers.  Gardaí often utilise the programme to highlight the issue of burglary prevention, as well as particular ongoing investigations.  The Government will do everything we can to support the gardaí in their work, provide resources as public finances permit and respond to any legislative needs that are identified.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.
#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The key point is that the figures for burglaries have spiralled and detection rates have plummeted.  That is very worrying as the people involved seem to feel they will not be apprehended, which comes from the knowledge that very little forensic work is being done at the site of these crimes.  I know that from my experience.I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I wonder if the failure to conduct adequate forensic work is a resource issue for An Garda Síochána and if adequate resources are being provided for gardaí to conduct this important work.  I doubt that is the case.  This form of work should be among the most inexpensive to carry out, and in comparison with other crimes and forms of detection, and taking into account the extensive co-operation which gardaí receive from the community, the cost of this work is relatively low.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that sufficient resources are made available for this most important work so the problems behind the statistics we have seen published this past week can be tackled effectively.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I will be brief.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner and is always posing the question of what the Government can do through legislation and resources; depending on what is available, the requests will be met.  It is something dear to the Minister's heart, as I am sure the Deputy already knows.There are actions which will probably have a far greater impact on the reduction in burglaries.  For example, Muintir na Tíre has established 1,345 community alert groups, and we all know of the success of neighbourhood watch schemes.  Those processes will have a major impact.  The Deputy is probably well aware that when either the individuals or gangs involved in burglaries are brought to court, it is usually after a series of burglaries, and forensics only match one burglary with another.  When that type of information is held within the organisation, it can be seriously effective.

Although I do not purport to speak on behalf of Deputy Doyle, I know he is aware of and supportive of this issue, as he has been over a number of years.  I have not spoken on any issue that is more important than this in my time in the Dáil, and I have grave concerns about this project.I acknowledge and recognise the excellent work done by Wicklow community first responders, a voluntary group set up almost ten years ago that went active in spring 2005.  As recently as a week or two ago, the Greystones cardiac first responders were presented with a special recognition award at Greystones town council.  It is a group that has worked hand in glove with the ambulance service, engendering a positive and progressive relationship over the past seven or eight years.  Where the scheme is in operation, if somebody rings "999", an ambulance is dispatched and the person in the ambulance centre would also ring a local volunteer who would have a defibrillator, oxygen and other first aid equipment.  That person would also be trained and tested to an acceptable standard to carry out work.In County Wicklow we are very lucky to have approximately 500 individuals at 33 locations around the county who have been called out on 1,500 occasions in the past seven years.  They have saved lives, and a newspaper article detailed how a young girl in Tinahely was saved in a doctor's surgery by the community first responders.  The scheme is recommended by the Irish Heart Foundation and heart authorities in Britain.  It has competed in many competitions around the country.Over the past number of years the group would have been called out for problems in five categories, including chest pain, heart attack, cardiac and respiratory arrest, breathing difficulties, stroke and choking.  The Pre-hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, in its wisdom, has in the past year changed the call-out criteria, which are now limited to chest pain and choking.  There is grave concern among volunteers that if the proposals are implemented - it looks like they will be - the scheme will collapse.  This will happen because it will not be utilised to the extent that it could be, as the lifeblood of the scheme is getting called out to assist in the community.  In addition, volunteers have come under pressure in the past few weeks within the local communities; in one case where they were not called out in Blessington, there was a backlash.This scheme costs the HSE nothing aside from the initial training.  When Deputy Doyle was involved with the HSE, he was instrumental in getting funding for that training.  The volunteers now self-train, with two or three groups in Wicklow waiting to join; approximately twice every year 50 new members are trained on a voluntary basis.  It is one of the most positive and progressive groups of people that I have met in my time, and it is frustrating that the scheme is in danger.  This is not about cutting back or lack of resources.  I listened to a HSE official talk about smarter use of our resources but this resource will not continue unless the Minister takes direct action and we have a little common sense.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for the opportunity to discuss the recent policy developments associated with it.  Community response in various forms has long been an important support in the delivery of health care in Ireland and, in particular, in pre-hospital care for people who have been unfortunate enough to suffer serious illness or injury.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the enormous voluntary contribution, commitment and assistance offered by various schemes in responding to emergency calls over the years.There are two types of priority emergency call-out in Ireland for the national ambulance service.  ECHO calls are for situations involving life-threatening cardiac or respiratory arrest and DELTA calls involve life-threatening situations other than cardiac or respiratory arrest.  The national standard for addressing ECHO and DELTA calls is the EMS priority dispatch standard, which is issued by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC.  Under this standard, ECHO calls may be responded to by cardiac first responders, but DELTA calls require a minimum response of a trained emergency first responder.  The new policy was approved on 27 March 2012.  It will ensure that the integration of cardiac first responder schemes into priority 999 call responses has a robust governance framework in place.  As a consequence, however, neither HIQA nor PHECC standards support the dispatch of community first responders to DELTA calls any longer.  There is, therefore, a significant clinical and governance risk in using community first responders for DELTA calls and this practice will have to stop.I would like to emphasise that the use of community first responder schemes is still important and will remain so.  These volunteers are found in workplaces, sports clubs, at public events and within local communities, as the Deputy said.  They are often first on the scene at an incident and they are in an ideal position to use their training to provide care and treatment until further assistance arrives.  However, the use of community first responders as a dispatched first response to 999 calls was developed before the introduction of national clinical standards for emergency responses and cannot be sustained, other than for ECHO cardiac and respiratory call-outs.  Should a community group wish to be able to respond to DELTA priority emergency call-outs, then the responders would need to be certified at emergency first responder level.  Standard national training courses are available from approved bodies and the national ambulance service, through local liaison managers, would welcome approaches from groups and individuals who wish to contribute in this way to the provision of emergency services in their communities.

The previous Government followed a recommendation from the Law Reform Commission integrated into a Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which was passed by this Dáil.  Its purpose is to give a defence to an action for an individual who assists someone else in good faith and who, whether through omission or commission, adds to the injury.  If something is not broken, one should not fix it.  The Minister of State's reply sounded nice.  I spoke to the Minister of Health about this issue earlier but the reply contained a lot of bureaucratic waffle and I say that with deference to the Minister of State, whom I do not blame personally.  However, she should go back to the Minister to examine this issue.  Of the 1,500 calls responded to last year, I am not aware of one complaint by a member of the public.  I regret that I can almost assure the Minister of State that if the current policy remains in place, the scheme will collapse.  A total of 500 people work on a voluntary basis, mostly in isolated areas with little immediate access to the national ambulance service within a certain timeframe.  These areas, which are represented by Deputy Doyle, myself and others, will suffer.  The previous Minister for Health set about replicating the scheme throughout the country.The standard of the people trained as community first responders is excellent.  They have won awards and they are of the highest calibre.  They are hugely committed but they are seething and frustrated at the bureaucratic nature of the HSE over the recent period.  They had an excellent relationship with the ambulance service of the old health board, which was progressive and took this issue on board when other ambulance services did not.  There was resistance in other areas because people working in the ambulance service felt they would be replaced by volunteers.  This is an invaluable resource to an area and if we let it slip, I will hang my head in shame.  The Minister of State should go back to the bureaucrats.  When we were on the Opposition benches, we spoke about them consistently.  It would be a poor day if we allowed this scheme to collapse based on a load of waffle, with no tangible evidence that the current scheme has caused trouble or that the new standards will bring about improvement.

Its officials are not recommending that the procedure and the clinical standards be changed.  It is important that we recognise that community first responders did significant good work in the past and, hopefully, they will continue to do so.  There are times when there are unintended consequences following the introduction of particular standards and I will speak to the Minister again about this.  Perhaps additional training needs to be provided to satisfy HIQA and the other groups involved.  It would be a sorry day if this group of volunteers were lost to any community.

Last year, 403 reviews were carried out on individual DCA payments.  Between September 2011 and March 2012, 213 reviews resulted in the withdrawal of the payment.  DCA is a gateway payment and, therefore, its withdrawal quickly precipitates the loss of carer's allowance and associated benefits.  The review process can result in significant financial loss to families with special needs children.  The withdrawal of DCA and, for instance, the respite care grant means an automatic loss of €5,408 per annum.  In other cases, carer's allowance is also lost and that can be the principal social welfare payment of a household.  It is vital that the review process is fair and, currently, that is far from the case.  I have debated this with the Minister for Social Protection on a number of occasions and some progress has been made.Parents are not given sufficient notice of the review to gather supporting documentation from consultants, therapists etc, which is necessary to re-establish successfully their eligibility for the payment.  They have received letters in a number of cases giving them only three weeks notice of a review.  I suggested to the departmental officials responsible for information technology and the Minister at a joint committee meeting that an automatic notice of review should be sent six months in advance.  Following my intervention, I was delighted the Minister said she would consider extending the notice period to two or three months.  What is the updated position?  Has that happened?A desk review of documentation can result in the cessation of payment.  When we debated this, I proposed to the Minister that no payment should be stopped without the Department first meeting the claimant and affording him or her the opportunity of an oral hearing, given the crisis that can result from the withdrawal of payment.  Has that policy change been implemented?Since the last time I debated the issue with the Minister, the position has worsened.  It has come to my attention that due to a backlog of reviews in the Department, as opposed to in the social welfare appeals office, a number of DCA payments were cut off before the desk review had been conducted at all.  For example, a parent has been written to and told a review would take place, has submitted the forms and all the supporting documents, all of which are on time.  When the conclusion of the notice period arrives, however, their payment is cut off because no decision has been made.  It seems to be an automatic cut-off, which is wrong in the extreme. Does the Minister of State agree this is of great concern and seems to suggest the overriding concern of the Department is cost saving rather than the needs of the disabled children?At the very least, will the Minister ensure no payment is cut off in advance of the completion of the review?  It is not good enough to say, "We will find in favour whenever we get around to the review and we will backdate it".  This causes hardship and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme does not cover the full loss.  We must remember we are dealing with a child of significant needs in the first instance.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  He is correct that it is not just a relevant but a very pertinent issue that is being dealt with on an ongoing basis.  Domiciliary care allowance is currently paid to more than 24,000 parents and guardians in respect of 26,000 children at a cost of approximately €100 million in 2011, with the accompanying respite care grant costing a further €45 million.  In addition, the Department makes an extensive range of payments to support families with children.  In 2011, some €2.08 billion was paid out in respect of 1.13 million children on child benefit.  Qualified child increases were also paid to people on social welfare payments in respect of some 495,000 children - 369,000 at full rate and 126,000 at half rate.Domiciliary care allowance can be paid in respect of children under 16 years of age who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and-or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.A review policy is an integral part of all social welfare schemes and is necessary to ensure payments continue to be made only to those customers who meet the qualifying conditions.  Domiciliary care allowance cases are routinely reviewed to ensure all the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either a scheduled review on the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed or on information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child's disability and how their care needs may change over time.  Customers who are reviewed are asked to provide relevant up-to-date medical evidence and details of the additional care needs of their child.  This information is assessed by a medical adviser and a decision is made based on the medical opinion he or she provides.  Where payment is stopped as a result of a review, the customer is invited to submit any further information he or she may wish to have considered, and that information is further examined and-or he or she may appeal the decision directly to the social welfare appeals office.Eligibility for domiciliary care allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.  No specific condition or disability rules a child in or out of qualifying for the allowance.An expert medical group was established in advance of the transfer to this Department in 2009 and recommended that the most appropriate way for the Department to conduct assessments for medical eligibility was by way of desk assessment of the evidence submitted by the claimant, as provided by themselves and the medical staff who regularly see the child.  It was considered that it was not necessary for the child to be physically examined by the Department's medical assessors as the diagnosis of the child's condition by their GP is accepted.  What is being assessed is the level of additional care and attention the child requires as a result of that condition or disability and if this is substantially in excess of that required by a child of the same age without the condition.The effective and efficient operation of the scheme is monitored regularly and any improvements to the delivery of service that are identified are implemented.  I assure the Deputy that the Department is committed to ensuring those children who meet the conditions for the scheme will continue to receive payments.

I strongly advise any Deputy but, in particular, the Ministers to look at sites such as www.magicmum.com or www.rollercoaster.ie as well as the various Facebook pages, which show a level of confusion and fear about the reviews.  If anything, I ask the Minister of State to take the time to clarify, as she has in regard to some of this, what the reviews are about.  The level of fear evident among some of the domiciliary care allowance recipients is somewhat out of synch with the scale of the review-based control system.  Nonetheless, I am not opposed to the reviews once they are fair, notice is given and only on completion is a decision made to end or confirm payment.The fear is in some degree led by the unfairness and lack of transparency, and I ask the Minister of State to end the confusion.  A substantial group of 24,000 people are in receipt of this payment but we have sent out mail shots to many more.  I ask that a letter would go to each recipient informing him or her whether a review was recommended in the first instance by the medical officer who decided his or her case, given there will not be a review in many cases.  If there is a review, the recipient should be informed whether it is a three year or five year review, or otherwise, and when the next review is scheduled to take place, which will give enough notice.  Recipients should also receive advice on what supporting documentation they need to keep on an ongoing basis and what to have ready, and they should be encouraged to write a diary of the extra care needs of their child so they can present the full position.  This would also facilitate the Department.Given the level of fear that exists and the concerns people are raising, will the Minister meet the parent and carer's representatives so they can better articulate what I have tried to articulate today?

From my experience of children with disabilities, there are children who will not progress - we know that because it is obvious and we do not need to go into specifics.  It is not even in one particular area.  Children with autism can sometimes be on the very mild end of the scale and in other cases on the profound end, and there is a whole range of categories.  However, as someone who is interested in ensuring people with disabilities progress in life in as independent a way as possible, I would expect there are certain children who would progress and that training and involvement in school and with their local community would ensure them the level of attention and detail they need.  For example, the expectation is that when a three, four or five year old with certain needs reaches eight or nine years of age, the level of dependence would have diminished.  The review process is about that more than anything else.I regret there is confusion.  I understand that when a letter such as this comes in the door, into circumstances where people felt secure in the past, it can lead to a certain amount of confusion, and not just of insecurity.  I will convey the Deputy's remarks to the Minister.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  We must consider the various methods of transport.  We should consider whether more advantageous methods of transport of commercial goods are available and whether they should be considered and planned for in the future.  I refer to the transport of goods by rail which has fallen out of favour in recent years.  However, as a method of transport, it could be most advantageous in several areas.  Clearly, this is a more long-term objective, but it should be considered and planned for in the future.  Consideration should be given to strategic planning to reduce as much as possible the level of transport of goods by road because rail transport offers considerable advantages, especially in terms of protecting the environment, safety and alleviating traffic congestion.  Significant environmental questions arise from the numbers of huge juggernauts and heavy goods vehicles on the roads on a daily and hourly basis.  Significant safety questions arise also.  There is no doubt that rail transport is considerably safer than road transport, especially in the transit of goods.  It would be worthwhile if the main centres of commerce were linked by rail services and if they were used extensively.  If necessary, support should be given to the transport of goods by rail.  The reduction in congestion as a result of increased rail transport would be another important advantage.  Although there has been a move away from rail transport in recent years, we should consider it as a strategic option which should be planned for in the future.The summary of the digest on the Bill provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service reads: "This Bill overhauls the system for testing the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles in Ireland and permits the Minister for Transport to assign new functions in this area to the Road Safety Authority (RSA).  In addition the driver licence system is being centralised and transferred from the Local Authorities to the RSA."  Therefore, there are two objectives, the first of which is to test the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles.  The second is to centralise the driver licensing system.  I will refer to the latter objective first.I have a serious problem with the centralisation of the driver licensing system, as the system we have in place is quite good.  The digest on the Bill provided outlines a point I wish to highlight.  It states:The review also concludes that the existing licence-delivery processing system has many advantages.  For example, the current system is locally based, has a reasonably quick turnaround time for licences and is accessible to customers.There is too much centralisation and the less there is, the better.  Services to the public should be provided locally, if possible.  There are considerable advantages to be gained in providing such public services locally.  As the digest states, they are locally based and accessible and there is a good turnaround time.  The experience of increasing centralisation of services in recent years suggests it is not the be all and end all of policy and it should not be considered or imposed willy-nilly by any Government.  We need only consider the recent centralisation of the medical card system to realise it is fundamentally flawed.  Everyone in the House deals with medical card customers on a daily basis, many of whom have been waiting months.  It has been a complete and absolute disaster.  The system continues to be difficult to deal with and people find it difficult to get their medical card.  It is even difficult for public representatives to deal with.The digest gives an outline of the centralised driver licencing system provided for in the legislation as follows:A centre of excellence will be established within the RSA to manage services relating to identity management, medical fitness and contract management.  This will involve a number of staff additional to existing staffing levels who may be redeployed from MTOs.Whenever I hear the term "centre of excellence", a doubt is raised in my mind because the various centres we are supposed to have are anything but centres of excellence.  All acute hospital inpatient services in north Tipperary were transferred to Limerick, we were informed to a centre of excellence, but it has turned out to be anything but.The digest provides more information on the proposed legislation as follows:• A person receives a unique identifier when applying for a theory test which will follow him/her through all aspects of the licensing process.• An application for a learner permit/driver licence will be made through a "front-office"‘ network of agents, who will carry out some basic checks on the application and supporting documents before forwarding them to the central processing unit.• A central processing unit will be set up to process applications and deal with day-to-day customer service queries.• Databases covering the Driver Theory Test, Driving Test and NVDF will be streamlined to increase efficiencies and improve customer service.• The service will meet its operating costs from licensing fees.Where have I heard that one before?  I have heard it before almost word for word; all one has to do is replace "driver licence" with "medical card".  This is exactly what was proposed in respect of the current debacle that is the centralised medical card applications system.I am concerned that if the centralisation of the driver licensing system goes ahead the result will be similar to what we have experienced with the medical card system.  Services such as this should be provided locally where they are accessible to customers.  There is no necessity for the centralisation of this service.This question has been raised by other interested parties including the IMPACT trade union which stated that this proposal goes against a recent OECD report on the public service in Ireland which argued that local authorities should be used more frequently in delivering public services.  It further stated that the current service also enjoys a very high rate of customer satisfaction, and that this proposal runs a very serious risk of further eroding local services.  The suggestion that the driver licensing system be centralised at a national level should be re-examined.  Local authorities, which have provided this service for some time, are doing a good job and should be left to do it. I welcome the idea of a plastic card driver licence as provided for in the legislation.  However, I would not support centralising the system.Everybody can support the sections dealing with testing of commercial vehicles for road worthiness.  Generally speaking, I would not have a difficulty with the many sections dealing with that.  There will be a need for detailed scrutiny of those sections as the Bill goes through this House, the committee and back to this Chamber for further consideration. Commercial vehicles are involved in 20% of all road fatalities, and 32% of commercial vehicles tested at roadside checks in 2011 were found to require immediate action.  That is unacceptable and must be dealt with quickly.The figures on this area are very informative.  In 2011 there were just under 600 roadside checks at which 4,919 vehicles were checked.  A total of 47.8% of those vehicles had defects, and 32% had defects serious enough to warrant immediate action, that is, impoundment, repair on site or a new test.  There is no doubt we need to upgrade the regulations and ensure commercial vehicles are in proper working order and are safe to operate on the roads.Mr. Noel Brett of the Road Safety Authority has stated that in January and February of this year there were 13 fatalities arising from road traffic accidents in which commercial vehicles were involved.  The RSA has said also that each fatality costs approximately €2.5 million, which means that road deaths in 2011 would have cost €465 million.  That is a cash cost but there are many other costs, including the trauma that arises for families.  We must have a system in operation that ensures these vehicles are fully operational and are in good repair.  We expect there would be a further reduction in road fatalities and in non-fatal accidents also.As I said, I have no particular difficulty with the sections on the road worthiness aspect but I have a difficulty with the transfer of this service to the Road Safety Authority.  Effectively, it is a centralisation of the service.  If we consider the problems identified in the PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report on this, of which there are a number, they include inconsistency in the application of testing centres across the country; inadequate communications between the RSA, local authority officers and authorised testers; limited roadside enforcement by the Garda; possible conflicts of interest due to reliance on the integrity of the various stakeholders; poor statistical information; no central database and so on.  While I am sure difficulties arise in the current system that does not mean the service must be centralised under the Road Safety Authority.  Provided reasonable resources are put in place and a reasonable review and monitoring of the system is done on an ongoing basis, and with the new technology type facilities that are available, there is nothing in the report by the PwC which would mean, for instance, that the system would have to be transferred to any other authority.  Those are difficulties but they can be addressed fully by the local authorities and the other agencies involved.This Bill is stripping functions from local authorities.  I understood, as I am sure did every other Member, that the future of local authorities was not to strip functions from them but to give them new functions and to modernise and upgrade local authorities, yet in two key areas, namely, the driver licensing system and the road worthiness testing, local authority functions are being reduced.  In the case of the driver licensing system, our experience is that major difficulties will arise with that and I appeal to the Minister to allow the local authorities continue the system they are operating.  If it needs to be upgraded or modernised, well and good, but they are doing a reasonably good job and they should be allowed to continue to do it.  They are locally based with easy customer access and have a good turn-around time, which is not the case with the medical card system.  I am concerned that the system being proposed will experience the same difficulties as that system.The lack of availability of credit is becoming a serious problem for hauliers and agricultural contractors and has resulted in a significant increase in the age of heavy goods vehicles on our roads.  Last week, the Minister of State and I met agricultural contractors who pointed out the major difficulties they face in accessing credit.  By closing down access to credit, the banks have created serious problems in terms of the age and roadworthiness of vehicles on our roads.  The Minister must address this issue.The cost of fuel is a major consideration for hauliers and agricultural contractors.  It is a pity a recent proposal to reduce the cost of fuel by 5 cent per litre was not accepted.  While such a reduction would not have been significant, it would have indicated to industry that the Government acknowledged the problems it faces.The issue of fuel laundering must also be addressed.  While it is open to question whether the introduction of a rebate system would solve the problem, it is clear something must be done to address the issue as it is creating serious difficulties for commercial companies and private car owners.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I will share time with Deputies Brian Walsh, Terence Flanagan and Marcella Corcoran Kennedy.The Bill has two main components, namely, the reform of commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing and the designation of the Road Safety Authority as the driving licensing authority.  Its provisions in these two areas will bring about a significant and positive change to the way in which commercial vehicles are tested and managed and the operation of the driver licensing system.  The result will be a major improvement in service for all those availing of testing and licensing arrangements.  This is part of the reform process outlined in the programme for Government.The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a legislative framework for commercial vehicle testing.  The legislation will result in the functions of local authorities in the area of commercial vehicle roadworthiness being transferred to the Road Safety Authority and provide for a new licensing authorisation system in respect of test centres and authorised testers.  It will also introduce greater powers of enforcement through targeted roadside inspections and inspection of commercial premises in respect of vehicle maintenance and roadworthiness.The Bill also provides for revised arrangements for the processing and management of driving licences.  This change will provide the necessary support for the introduction of a plastic card driving licence at the beginning of 2013 and the transfer of driver licensing functions from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority.  The reforms being delivered on foot of the Bill will result in a significant saving in the current organisation of public services in the relevant areas and improved public services.  I commend the commitment shown by the Road Safety Authority, local authorities and those working in road safety in responding to the challenge of public service reform to deliver the service changes underpinning the Bill.Regarding commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing, a number of years ago, following some high profile collisions involving commercial vehicles, the then Department of Transport tasked the Road Safety Authority with undertaking a comprehensive review of arrangements for the roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Transport yesterday, it was reported that progress is being made at European Union level on the operation of the tachograph system.  This will make the operation of vehicles safer and more transparent.Commercial vehicles are currently required to undergo an annual roadworthiness test at an authorised test centre.  Local authorities are responsible for authorising privately operated garages to provide testing services and complete regular supervision of the authorised testers in their areas.  The Department also approved the recommendations of a comprehensive review carried out by an independent consultant on behalf of the RSA.  This involved taking two courses of action with a view to raising permanently the standard of commercial vehicle testing throughout the country.  The first element was a complete overhaul of the commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing system to provide a multi-strand approach.  This was to be achieved by addressing the testing process to ensure roadworthiness tests are conducted impartially and correctly at all times and developing a programme of roadside inspections to ensure continuous compliance with roadworthiness standards.  Further measures include the introduction of operator premises checks and intelligence-led targeting of responsibility for the management and operation of the commercial vehicle testing system.The two elements are linked and necessary to meet the overall objective of the transformation programme which will improve the quality of commercial vehicles using our roads and thereby help to improve road safety, reduce congestion, ensure fair competition, develop a greater awareness of road safety issues and promote a culture of safety in the transport industry in respect of the use and maintenance of commercial vehicles, including trailers.  It has been claimed that commercial pressures have led some operators to cut corners in vehicle maintenance and compliance with the required vehicle standards, thus providing such operators with an unfair commercial advantage.In terms of safety, an estimated 17.5% of road fatalities on Irish roads in the period from 1996 to 2010 involved commercial vehicles.  An improvement in the roadworthiness of such vehicles will not only save lives but also result in substantial savings to the State.  The avoidance of at least four fatal or 25 serious injury collisions per annum involving commercial vehicles would more than cover the operational cost.  I emphasis, however, that the avoidance of loss, injury and pain for the families involved will be the real benefit.Another major contribution of the reform is to reduce congestion caused by breakdowns of commercial vehicles.  It is estimated that up to 10% of congestion on primary roads is caused by such incidents and vehicles that are not compliant with roadworthiness testing systems are considered to make a significant contribution to the problem.  Based on UK estimates of the economic impact of such incidents, the cost to Ireland of congestion caused by commercial vehicle breakdowns could be in the range of €1 billion to €2 billion per annum.  Avoiding even a small number of such incidents, for example, on the M50 or in the Dublin Port tunnel, would deliver considerable economic gains.The objective of the Bill is to introduce a reform programme that will improve the roadworthiness and safety of commercial vehicles and provide for the introduction of a plastic card driving licence system with more efficient and effective management arrangements.  This is a positive part of the reform agenda.
#BrianWalsh	unknown-#BrianWalsh-party	unknown-#BrianWalsh-dob	unknown-#BrianWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on significant road safety legislation.  I understand this is the third road safety Bill the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has introduced since assuming office only 14 months ago.  This emphasises the importance he attaches to the issue.  The Minister has consistently identified as a priority the introduction of measures that will help to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers on our roads, and significant progress has been made in this regard.  2011 was the sixth consecutive year in which the number of road fatalities declined, and last year's figure of 186 fatalities was the lowest since records began.  To date this year, the number of road deaths has been significantly lower than it was at this point in 2011; therefore, we are on course to reduce that number even further.We are very quick on this side of the House to blame the Members opposite for things they get wrong.  It is important on this occasion, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that we recognise the contribution made by the previous Government in improving safety on our roads, in particular people like Noel Dempsey and our fellow county man, Séamus Brennan, who was Minister for Transport in the past.  They have contributed a huge amount to improving safety on our roads over the years.  This Government is continuing in that vein with the introduction of this Bill.While these statistics are an indication that the Government and State agencies are moving in the right direction, it would be wrong for us to suggest these figures represent a success, because just one life lost on our roads is one too many, as many thousands of people affected by such tragedies can attest.  It is for this reason that this Bill, which has the potential to reduce road fatalities even further, is to be welcomed wholeheartedly, and I strongly commend it to the House.  It is a further significant step in the right direction, given that nearly one in five fatal road accidents in Ireland involve commercial vehicles.  It proposes to strengthen and reform the area of commercial vehicle road worthiness, and streamline the Irish driver licence system, which has operated through a number of disparate strands since 1964.When legislation like this comes before the House, there is sometimes a tendency to focus on the technical detail and lose sight of the human side and the background to the Bill.  Therefore, it is important to remember that the provisions of this Bill have been shaped by the recommendations of a review that followed two tragic road accidents a little over six years ago.  A number of young people lost their lives in tragedies involving buses at Kentstown in County Meath and at Clara in County Offaly in 2005 and 2006.  In the case of the five schoolgirls who died tragically in the Kentstown crash, an inquest subsequently heard that the driver would not have lost control of the vehicle if the anti-lock braking system had been working properly.  A well regulated system of ensuring commercial vehicle road worthiness might have meant that things worked properly, and if the Bill before us now was in place back then, perhaps such a tragedy could have been averted.  It is unfortunate that tragedies are sometimes required as a precursor for the kind of change that we are introducing today, but it is responsible legislation such as this which will bolster road safety and allow us to avoid such "if only" scenarios in future.  By introducing a regime of standardised and enforcement of safety standards for commercial vehicles, we are answering the call of those who advocated greater regulation following those two tragedies in particular.I welcome this Bill and any measures that will further reduce the number of lives lost on our road.  I commend the Minister for introducing his third Bill in his short time at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I also commend the Bill to the House.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I welcome this Bill, which follows on from the Government's commitment to improve road safety by improving the quality of commercial vehicles and which, in turn, will reduce the number of accidents, injuries and deaths on the nation's roads.  This Bill arises from a review of the current system in 2006 by PricewaterhouseCoopers, in light of a number of high profile accidents.The Road Safety Authority is given two major functions under the Bill.  It will now be responsible for the testing system which checks the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles in Ireland.  It will ensure the new testing system will be more consistent and have impartial testing standards, and will be targeted at operators who often use non-roadworthy commercial vehicles.  The driver licence system will be centralised and its functions transferred from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority.  The Road Safety Authority will be responsible for the introduction of the plastic card licence, which is a requirement from an EU directive that comes into effect from 1 Jan 2013.We know from statistics that commercial vehicles are involved in approximately 20% of all road fatalities in Ireland, while 32% of commercial vehicles tested at roadside checkpoints last year required immediate action, so there is something wrong with the system.  We also know that Irish registered vehicles were disproportionately failing road side checks in the UK.  Last year, there were 186 fatalities on our roads.  This was down on other years, but as the previous speaker said, any death on our roads is one too many.  It was the focus of the previous Government and will continue to be a focus of this Government, with a third Bill being introduced by the Minister in the area of road safety.  We know that the targets laid out in the Road Safety Strategy are lower than the number of deaths.  Mr. Gay Byrne, chairman of the Road Safety Authority, should be praised for all the good work he has done in this area in changing the culture.  Drivers are now more conscious when they get behind the wheel of a car.  Mr. Noel Brett, chief executive of the Road Safety Authority, recently stated that each fatality on our roads costs €2.5 million, which means road deaths alone last year cost €465 million.  That is lot of money that is needlessly caught up in these court cases.Greater efficiencies and accountability will be achieved in the delivery of the service, and we will have greater value for money with the transfer of the driver licensing system to the Road Safety Authority.  When the review was carried out in 2006, it showed there were 158 private operators using a variety of testing facilities and equipment who were supervised by 30 public authorities, and that it was almost impossible to achieve consistent, high quality testing.  A new ICT programme will be rolled out to help this improved system.  This information system will link the test operators with the Road Safety Authority, the Garda Síochána and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.The introduction of risk rating registers will help to identify those vehicle owners, drivers or testing centres who have an issue.  Recently there was a broadcast on the scandal in NCT centres and the fact there are rogue testers operating in some centres.  It is important that there are greater inspections.  I note from the Bill that authorised officers have the power to ensure high standards of testing are achieved across the country.One of the challenges is to ensure that those prosecuted are brought through the courts quickly.  I welcome the publication of the regulatory impact analysis by the Minister, which sets out the various options and choices that were open to him and the reason certain decisions were taken.  That is an example of open government to which this Administration adheres.I have two concerns.  The first is in respect of accountability.  The Road Safety Authority will not be accountable to Dáil Éireann and the Minister will refer parliamentary questions to the authority.  That needs to be followed up.  There are also 200 staff working in local authorities in this area.  We need to ensure they are redeployed and put into more busy areas in the public service.Any Bill that helps reduce fatalities on our roads is to be welcomed, and I wish this Bill a speedy passage.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	318	This Bill is an important part of the Government's overall road safety strategy.  Over many years we have all become more conscious of the need for modified driver behaviour and better vehicles for all road users.  High profile accidents and low profile accidents alike have proven to us the need to improve road safety for all users.  We can all recall tragic accidents in our own areas.  I am thinking of one in Clara.  These must motivate us to put safety first.One of our most important sectors is the commercial vehicle sector.  These vehicles perform an important function in the efficient movement of goods in and out of the country and of people around the country.  They are, literally, one of the key drivers of the economy.  The Bill is in everyone's interests and not just the commercial sector.  It is in all our interests to have commercial vehicles roadworthy and up to standard.While it is almost 30 years since commercial vehicle roadworthiness was introduced, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report in 2007 clearly identified many deficiencies and inefficiencies in how vehicles are tested.  While there are many compliant operators maintaining their vehicles to high standards, the report found the overall standard was low.  For road users , it is vital commercial vehicles are tested, and the proposed annual test will minimise breakdowns and will, in turn, ease road traffic congestion which frustrates all of us drivers from time to time.I welcome the proposal to link test operators, the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Finance and to give the Garda access to the system.  This is the type of joined-up thinking we need to see more of across other Departments.I have heard criticism of the Road Safety Authority from previous contributors to the debate.  However, we must acknowledge its track record in public education and information campaigns motivated by its motto "working to save lives".  I recently saw the authority's road safety roadshow at a Teen Aware youth gig in Charleville Castle in Tullamore.  I was impressed with the innovative way the authority connected with young people as a way of conveying serious road safety messages of being careful and slowing down.There are other issues to be considered for commercial drivers on which I have had representations from local haulage companies and which I support.  At the minimum, pull-in points have been highlighted to me as an immediate need for long distance drivers to deal with driver fatigue.  In addition, I have had representations from residents of housing estates where some HGVs are parking in or in close proximity to housing estates while the driver gets a rest, but this is causing difficulties for residents.  I have been advised by the local authority that they have no power to move these vehicles.  This points to the need for resting places for drivers.Fuel laundering and the price of fuel have been well debated and I know the Irish Road Haulage Association has been meeting the Department of Finance to examine an essential user fuel rebate.  I hope it is successful in its endeavours.With regard to licensing, I welcome the movement to the plastic card licence.  It has been a long time coming.  While I acknowledge that the RSA aims to be the centre of excellence in getting the centralised system up and running , I urge that the expertise available in local authorities continues to be utilised.I am glad to support the Bill and commend the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and his staff on their work in continuing to emphasise road safety, which will benefit us all.  I also acknowledge his ongoing consultation with the Joint Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I welcome the motivation behind the Bill.  I believe there is all-party support for this genuine attempt to bring down the number of deaths on the roads.  No one could quarrel with the idea that we should more stringently and strictly test commercial vehicles, which are responsible for so many of the fatalities and accidents on our roads.Having welcomed the Bill, however, I question the method by which this is done.  It shows a conventional type of thinking.  It is one of the hallmarks of this and other Governments, that when they come to improve a problem, they do not attack it in any radical fashion.  I refer to the extraordinary reliance in the Bill on the Road Safety Authority.  I do not want to be overly critical of the Road Safety Authority.  It has, undoubtedly, done an extremely good job in recent years in reducing the number of fatalities on the roads.  Contrary to what might have been said in the House yesterday, I congratulate the chairman, Mr. Gay Byrne, on having championed and led the tribe against these fatalities and on having done so with a certain amount of success.  His was an inspired appointment by the, then, Minister, Mr. Martin Cullen.  Mr. Gay Byrne is one of the great communicators of our time.  To convince drivers what a dangerous machine they have in their grip, it was important a communicator of the prowess and skills of Mr. Gay Byrne was put in charge.  He is listened to on the airwaves when he talks about this subject, as he is listened to when he talks about anything at all.  In that sense, his was a great appointment and a great re-appointment.  Long may he remain in that position, because he has a sincerity and a non-political drive that is welcome.I am concerned about the Road Safety Authority itself and the faith the Government has in it.  Successive Governments have shown that although they may have faith in the executive, they treat the Road Safety Authority as they do any other quango, by stuffing it with their own people when they come to power.  It shows an enormous disrespect for authorities set up by the State and with such important jobs to do that when it comes to making appointments to their boards, Governments constantly appoint their own party people rather than people with an expertise.  This is not an insignificant job.  Members of the Road Safety Authority get €8,100 a year for their pains.The Government has not improved on the practices of the previous Government in this respect.  It has made two appointments to the Road Safety Authority since it came to power.  The two appointments are fascinating.  The authority's annual report gives an account of both appointments and of what the individuals do.  What is so interesting is what the annual report leaves out.  I was disappointed to see that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who is a pioneer in making more independent appointments to quangos and who has championed the idea that they should go before Oireachtas committees and be examined, in this case has made two appointments that are blatantly political.  The two people are members or supporters of his own party and have no obvious qualifications for sitting on this body.  One, who gets €8,100 a year, not only lives in the Minister's constituency but nominated Mr. Kieran Dennison as a Fine Gael candidate in the 2009 local elections.  The other is a man from Roscommon who is regional director and organiser for Fine Gael in that area.  This is disgraceful behaviour on something that is so important as this body.  The annual report goes into great detail about both these people.  It tells us one of them has been the young farmer of the year, although God knows how that qualifies him for membership of the Road Safety Authority.

There cannot be anything wrong with that.  They wrote it themselves.I am not blaming the Minister especially for this because his predecessors did it too.  The people before him appointed party people as well.  Members of the Government cannot resist the temptation, despite their commitment to ensuring cronyism would go from politics when they came to power.  One of the great disappointments is that the Government has not kept to its promises in that regard or on interviewing potential appointees before Oireachtas committees.  That was something it could have done at no cost to the Exchequer.

It is amazing.  The transport sector appears to be the home of quangos - CIE, Dublin Bus and the National Roads Authority which is similar to the others in that it is being run by the Government which puts in its own people.  It shows great disrespect for the transport sector which is treated with such contempt when it comes to putting people on boards.  We cannot, therefore, take these authorities seriously.  I pity Mr. Gay Byrne when he wakes up in the morning and walks into a board meeting.  He must say, "God knows what sort of clowns they will put in today to sit on top of me."  He does not know who is coming in.  He is an extraordinarily eminent person, but he gets members of the board for whom he does not ask, whom he does not want and whose only qualification is that they are allied to a political party.

As long as he can retain that title, no doubt that will be enough for him.I wish to ask the Minister one or two questions about driver testing.  This issue has disturbed me all my life which is getting more disturbing as I get older.  Why do drivers who passed their test perhaps 40 or 50 years ago when they were 17 years not have to refamiliarise themselves with the rules of the road?  It is a most extraordinary anomaly and injustice that people can go from the age of 17 years perhaps to the age of 97 - throughout that period the rules of the road, signposts and everything else change - without in any way being expected to adapt to the rules of the road.  In other words, a person can obtain his or her driving licence at 17 years, drive until he or she drops or is put off the road for various reasons and does not have to adapt as the rules and signposts change.  Like many others in this House, I do not recognise the changes made because we are not subject to refamiliarisation or retesting.  Over a period people are not aware of rule changes or changes to signposts or road markings.  There must be a case for saying that after every ten, 15 or 20 years people should be retested in order to ensure they are not a danger on the road through ignorance of the changes made.  I do not know whether it should be an oral test or a driving test, but there is a lacuna in the regulations that makes people less safe as they get older, not because of age but because of the fact that they do not have to be retested.I must confess to being guilty of the above.  My wife who is not very happy to drive with me because of my lack of familiarity with some of the modern rules arranged some roundabout lessons for me for my birthday recently.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	346	She was very perceptive because when I learned to drive, roundabouts were not as common as they are now.  I have to admit that when some people travel in the car with me around a roundabout, they do not feel particularly comfortable.  One of them is my wife and when I woke up on the date of my birthday in July last year, I had a present of roundabout lessons in order to familiarise myself with how one should drive around a roundabout, with which I was not familiar.  I admit to being bad.  That is a lesson for many of us that it is necessary for those of us who passed their test many years ago to become more familiar with the changes to the rules of the road.I am sure the Minister will also address the issue of provisional licences, in respect of which the rules appear to be honoured more in the breach.  There is much anecdotal evidence that many are driving around without a full licence on provisional licences.  They are meant to have a fully qualified driver with them, but the Minister will be familiar with the fact that many are breaching the rule.  It has become a habit.  This is an issue on which we should take firm action as a matter of urgency.The other aspect about which I am slightly concerned is the fact that local authority powers are being centralised in the Road Safety Authority, RSA, which is of dubious value.  The fact that ministerial powers are also being passed to the RSA is more worrying.  I become concerned when I see State authorities of this type receiving more powers if they do not appear to be accountable.  Recently, I have seen a tendency for Ministers to refer parliamentary questions from Members of this House to such authorities.  That has been the case, not just with the RSA but often with the NRA also.  The change would leave them less accountable.  It is important that if these powers are to be delegated - I am not convinced it is a good thing; that is an open question - the authorities ought to be accountable in a meaningful way.  Members frequently receive the response to parliamentary questions, particularly in this area, that as it is not a matter of ministerial responsibility, it is being referred to the authority in question.  This is a convenient way for Ministers not to be accountable and the authority in question is even less accountable when it comes to asking it questionsThis raises the question of whether Ministers should be directly responsible and accountable in parliamentary terms for semi-State bodies and State authorities and answerable in this House in that regard.  I say this because they are 100% shareholders in semi-State bodies and, therefore, should be able to access the information in a public way.  This should apply where the State is a 100% shareholder, or a majority shareholder.  In reply to parliamentary questions Ministers should answer for the bodies in question in an open way; they should not be able to hide behind the fact that it is an authority with a supposedly independent board - admittedly, nearly all of political appointees are not independent - and, therefore, they are not able to give an answer to the particular question.  In matters of this nature it is most important that the State does answer questions.I see no reason the NRA or the RSA should not be accountable, not just to Oireachtas committees, because skilful people can get through such committees very easily by answering questions, but also under freedom of information, FOI, legislation.  I was surprised when I discovered this afternoon that the RSA weas not subject to freedom of information legislation.  It is one of a growing list of quangos which are not subject to freedom of information legislation for reasons which are inexplicable.  They are not subject to freedom of information per se in a blanket way.  Why, for instance, is the NTMA, the most powerful financial body in the State and an agency which controls and moves money, not subject to freedom of information?  The reason frequently given, not only in the case of the NTMA but also in the case of many other agencies, is that the information it holds or is withholding is commercially sensitive.  That is quite true and reasonable, and I accept that.  However, not all information held by the RSA, the NTMA, the National Roads Authority or others is commercially sensitive.  Only a certain amount of it is.  It would be perfectly reasonable for the Road Safety Authority and all State bodies without exception, including the Central Bank and all those bodies which are commercially owned, to be subject to freedom of information provided they could state with reasonable cause the information one requested was commercially sensitive.  That would be a perfectly reasonable proviso.  One could then appeal the decision to a less partisan body which could decide whether that information was commercially sensitive.The convenience with which so many bodies get blanket protection makes one suspicious they have something to hide or the Government - this one as much as the previous one - feels more comfortable having an umbrella of State agencies, authorities, institutes and bodies at arm's length, responsibility for which it can disclaim, from which it can detach itself if it wishes, or responsibility for which it can claim if they have any great successes, but which bodies are protected in terms of information which they will not release.  These bodies do not need or deserve protection, nor do they want it.  They should be proud of what they are doing and have nothing to hide.I cannot see what the Road Safety Authority would have to hide.  Mr. Gay Byrne, who is in charge of it, is a man who is extraordinarily good at conveying good news to the public, and when there is bad news to be conveyed, it should be conveyed honestly and openly.  All I can conclude is that there is a kind of in-built and instinctive protection which governs State bodies and authorities with which Governments, as a default position, feel safer than if they were to give some sort of open response to any information which was being required.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am glad the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State, have prioritised this issue.  This Bill has been in limbo for too long due to a lack of drive and action on the part of previous Ministers, but also due to human resources issues such as moving staff around, etc.  I am disappointed that legislation that needs to be enacted for the right reasons often gets stuck in the system for the wrong reasons and that it sometimes takes strong Ministers, a team of both senior and junior, to push matters along.  I appeal to staff in various Departments who need to move or change their work practices to engage, through their unions and through the various organisations, in a much speedier way in order that when matters are correct and everybody is in agreement on them, we get them done and can move on.This Bill implements international best practice and many of the changes arising from the investigations following the two bus crashes, in Kentstown in my county of Meath and in Clara, County Offaly.  Recommendations were made after those investigations because they were very tragic incidents and we had to take action.The Kentstown school bus accident was mentioned by many Members.  The crash occurred in May 2005 and I want to mention the five young people who lost their lives that day: Ms Amy McCabe, Ms Claire McCluskey, Ms Deirdre Scanlon, Ms Lisa Callan and Ms Sinéad Ledwidge.  That had a serious impact on the community, the county and, most certainly, on their families.  It is only right we are making changes that might prevent incidents such as that and that might lead to buses, lorries and commercial vehicles being kept in a better condition in order that such incidents would not happen again.  There will always be occasional accidents, but in this country there have been too many.  Incidents are avoidable and something could have been done to prevent them in these cases.  It is only right we are implementing changes.I welcome this Bill.  It introduces common sense measures, such as a new system that will overhaul the testing regime for commercial vehicles.  It will also bring in new spot checks for the testing centres which are needed.  We also need spot checks on the side of the road, and I welcome those as well.  These are logical steps in the right direction to try to ensure vehicles that are not roadworthy are put off the road and those in business who spend money ensuring their vehicles are in proper order and are fit for purpose get a fair chance to compete.It is only right there would be a level playing field throughout the country.  No more than one's address should not dictate the service one gets from the State, neither should it be the case that one can have a less roadworthy vehicle if one is from one part of the country rather than another.  There must be a standard applicable throughout the country and this Bill will achieve that.  It is only proper order.  I welcome the change the Bill will bring about.This legislation and other Bills the Minister and Minister of State have been driving forward form part of the provision of safer road transport in the country.  The Bill complements the recent positive measures taken by the Government to encourage more people to use public transport as well as to increase road safety.  In fairness, when money is tight, there have been many small initiatives, which I would call common sense measures, funded this year and last by the Government which will help improve road safety and make it easier for commuters to use the services.  These include, in my area, luckily enough, funding for the provision of new mini park-and-ride facilities along the R147, previously the N3, serving the Silver Tankard, Garlow Cross and Ross Cross areas.  We were years campaigning for funding for these simple park-and-ride facilities to take cars off the road and out of the way, and also to make it easier for those who want to park their car and get on the bus.  These are simple, common sense, low-cost measures and yet it took years to get them done.  Thankfully, this Minister and his team in the Department have come with a new approach of getting things done that will allow a big difference to be made, where possible, for small amounts of funding.In many areas, especially in my county, new permanent bus stops have been provided.  We got a few last year and more this year, including at Martry.  These are essential to make it easy for bus drivers to pull in.  Where they often had to pull in at seriously dangerous spots on main roads to take on passengers, they now have a proper place where they can pull in and passengers can board and disembark safely.  That is only right and I commend the Minister, and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, because this is happening throughout the country.Related to that and in the context of school buses and the tragedy of the victims of the Kentstown bus crash, we need to improve the areas where pupils are dropped off from school buses.  There have been major improvements on national bus routes, to which I have referred, but I stated years ago when first elected to this House that there is no reason we cannot improve the areas where school buses have been stopping for decades.  Even a small area of concrete cut into the embankment onto which one may step from the bus would provide a safer environment.  In some cases it is still dangerous getting on and off a school bus.There have been some improvements in the design of school buses but that is needed throughout the country.  As we update the fleet and while I am aware the Department has done much work on this, the buses must be made much more visible and safe, with colour, lights, etc., to protect young people when they are using the buses.We also need to introduce cameras onto buses.  There have been many improvements to seat belts and changes to rules on school buses following the incidents of which we have spoken, but there also need to be cameras on buses, both to improve safety and also to do away with bullying.  In the latter context, this is working quite well in the North.  Yesterday we visited Stormont where the members of the Committee for Education there told us there have been major success in eliminating bullying and anti-social behaviour on buses by putting cameras on them.I agree with Deputy Shane Ross regarding the necessity for continuous driver improvement and assessment.  We would all benefit from having our driving skills periodically monitored.  Such assessments should not be described as "tests", because that would only frighten people off the road.  Rather, they should consist of taking a supplementary driving lesson and being offered advice on bad habits that may have developed over years so that one can return to the roads as a better driver.  It is only by the grace of God that we do not have more traffic accidents.  Major improvements have been made in recent years in terms of the road fatality statistics, but there are still far too many accidents.  Continuous assessment of all drivers would help to reduce the volume of incidents, both minor and major.  It should no longer be a case of obtaining a licence at 17 or 18 years of age and never again having to submit to an assessment of one's driving skills.  We have spoken about this issue in the House and in committees on previous occasions and it is something we should seek to implement in the coming years.

The Bill provides that the Road Safety Authority will have operational oversight and a policy advisory role in regard to driving licences.  One of the key conditions of a common European licence is a requirement to meet minimum standards of physical and mental fitness to drive.  However, the existing regulations in this regard are not very clear.  We are all aware of the restrictions that apply to sufferers of neurological conditions such as epilepsy - where fits can impair one's ability to drive - such that they are required not to operate a motor vehicle for at least 12 months after an attack.  However, there are other conditions which have less well known implications for sufferers who wish to drive.  For instance, a constituent of mine who has diabetes was involved in a fatal accident more than five years ago following a blackout.  No doctor will pass her fit to drive even though she has had no similar experience in the interim.  The irony is that if she had admitted to a charge of dangerous driving on that occasion, she would now be back behind the wheel.  The problem is that doctors are afraid to identify her as fit to drive in case something similar happens, even though the risk of that is very low.The difficulty in this regard can be found in the relevant regulations.  We should take the opportunity presented by this legislation to clarify the regulations in regard to medical conditions which may indicate that a person should not be permitted to drive.  There are many people in this country with high-risk cardiovascular conditions and diabetes, for example, who are facing a double-edged sword.  If such a person is involved in an accident, he or she may be discriminated against but, at the same time, he or she can also, under the current regulations, pass under the radar until such time as an accident occurs.  That is not a good way to proceed in respect of these matters.  The regulations are not sufficiently tight for a doctor to risk censure by making a determination as to whether a person should or should not be permitted to drive.  By the same token, there are many doctors certifying patients as fit to drive because the regulations are too weak to support another conclusion.  We have talked about vehicle roadworthiness and people being brought up to date with the standards while simultaneously taking a very laissez-faire attitude in respect of the medical fitness of drivers, even against a background where appropriate legislative provision has been made to prevent people from driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  The existing regulations discriminate against some patients with certain physical or mental illnesses who are involved in a minor or major accident, but we are not in a position to take action in respect of others who might be best prevented from driving.  Every doctor must be very careful in making a recommendation that a person be put off the road for medical reasons, because that recommendation will have such a massive impact on the person’s life.  At the same time, where a person with one of several medical conditions is involved in an accident, it is subsequently very difficult to get him or her back on the road because the regulations offer no protection in that respect.In regard to the provisions relating to commercial vehicle roadworthiness, many speakers referred to the need for standardisation throughout the country.  There is an opportunity here to review the entire system for dealing with commercial vehicles.  For example, there should be a separate roadworthiness certificate for the tractor and trailer units of such vehicles, as well as a separate motor taxation requirement for each.  I have received several representations from commercial vehicle operators pointing out the difficulties arising from the way in which tractor units are taxed, which is not always representative of the type of trailer unit that is generally attached.  This issue must be addressed.Commentators have observed that the main problem with the current system is that limited roadside enforcement by the Garda and other agents has contributed to an environment where a significant number of commercial vehicle operators are lax when it comes to ensuring the roadworthiness of their vehicles.  However, a number of operators in the Wexford area have complained to me that the gardaí operating there are very effective in enforcing the legislation and that this is causing people to divert from Rosslare Europort to Dublin Port or even to Northern Ireland in the expectation that enforcement in those locations will be less rigorous.  This presentation of the situation is anecdotal and may not be generally accurate.  Nevertheless, it is vital to ensure the rules are enforced in a uniform way across the country and that all Garda divisions have adequate resources for that purpose.  Inconsistent enforcement in different parts of the country has an overall impact on operators' costs and an implication for competitiveness where some operators are spending less on maintenance in the expectation of meeting less rigorous enforcement in particular ports.Will the Minister of State indicate how many test centres will be in operation when the system is up and running?  There are currently 150 or so, while the corresponding figure for Britain is only 70.  To be more comparable with our neighbours we should have less than 20, which would amount to a huge reduction in the current complement.  The Department's regulatory impact review notes that industry representatives have pointed to commercial pressures leading some operatives to cut corners in terms of vehicle maintenance and compliance with the required standards.  We must have a standardised system throughout the State in order that everybody is impacted to the same degree.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I welcome this Bill as another step in a co-ordinated approach for ensuring our roads are safer for drivers, passengers and pedestrians.  It addresses two critical issues, namely, the transfer of testing of commercial vehicles to the Road Safety Authority and the transfer of the administration of driving licences from local authorities to the same body.  I take this opportunity to welcome the introduction of plastic card licences from next year.  However, with more than 2 million ten year licences in existence, they are likely to be replaced only at a rate of some 200,000 per year.  Will the Minister of State, in conjunction with the RSA, consider allowing drivers who would like to replace their existing licence to do so at a nominal charge?  That would greatly enhance the rate of transfer.Will the Minister increase the age limit from 70 to 72 years in respect of the requirement to undergo a medical to renew a licence in line with increased life expectancy and retirement ages being provided for in current and future legislation?  Seventy years is too young for this provision.Could we have clarity and receive co-operation on the conversion of driving licences for those who come here from other countries, particularly the United States?  It is very frustrating for a person who is fully competent to drive to come from the USA to this country and have to go through the rigmarole of testing and assessments and paying associated fees.The RSA is proposing that everyone will receive a unique identifier when applying for the theory test and that this identifier will follow each applicant through every stage of the licensing process.  This reminds me of the centralised medical card application system.  Concerns were raised by Deputies on all sides about the administration of that scheme.  I suggest the PPSN be incorporated as a primary recording number.  That is what the centralised medical card office now does.  The PPSN is recognised as the identifier for citizens in the State and the RSA should take note of this in the theory test application system.  It would be worthwhile to put a tracking system in place at the same time.I am concerned about the RSA's accountability to the Oireachtas and duty to respond to parliamentary questions.  A liaison officer for parliamentary business should be appointed to the agency.There is a perception that commercial and private vehicle tests are often failed on frivolous or cosmetic grounds rather than road safety issues.  Most of us know that is not true in the vast majority of cases, but we must convince the public and commercial vehicle operators that the priority is road safety, not cosmetics.  We are aware through recent initiatives that road safety statistics have improved dramatically in the last decade.  I would like statistics, however, for roadside checks.  There is an absolute figure and it should be compared with that in our European neighbours, in conjunction with the number of commercial licences granted.Those involved in the operation of commercial vehicles, from double decker buses to small commercial vans, are running on tight margins.  We must be careful how we add to those working in the road haulage sector.  We must have one eye on road safety, while keeping the other on the competitive nature of the economy, recognising that commercial vehicles are the circulatory system of the economy.  Commercial vehicles and their operators must comply with numerous obligations and regulations on an annual basis.  I hope this issue will be examined to reduce the time, expense and bureaucracy in obtaining HGV and LGV licences.  The system is onerous for owners, but if we can achieve better road safety figures and increase efficiency, it will be a welcome step.There are 148 test centres well spread out across the State.  In west Cork it would be helpful to have a maximum travelling distance to a test centre.  This would be welcomed by the Irish Road Haulage Association.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I thank the Technical Group for allowing me some of its time and thank the staff in the Whip's office for their contribution to the 31st Dáil.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister and thank him for some of the work he is doing, particularly on the issue of rural transport.  He has a good understanding of needs in rural areas, which I appreciate.Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion of the Bill and anyone who has looked at it in detail will see there are aspects that are okay.  I make it clear that I am 100% committed to helping and ensuring the number of deaths on the roads is continuously reduced.  We must, however, be careful because the devil is in the detail.  What are we doing in the Bill?  Already, those who use the roads in commercial or private vehicles have them tested.  We must go through strict measures to ensure vehicles are roadworthy.  At the end of the day, however, accidents will happen.  If one studies the Bill, one would believe the cause of all accidents on the roads is the state of vehicles.  There are certain things that cannot be legislated for such as driver behaviour, fatigue, weather conditions and other issues that arise that cause accidents.I want to speak up for haulage contractors and those building contractors who have vans.  It might be one man with his own van going to work every day, creating a job for himself.  The mantra of the Government since entering office has been that it wants to provide for creation of jobs.  I ask it to ensure those who have jobs keep them.  Anyone in the country who has one truck or a fleet of trucks is under extreme pressure.  He or she is trying to keep them on the road.  Fuel is acutely expensive - the price has doubled in the last few years - and there are ever increasing ancillary costs involved in transport.  The people concerned are trying to keep themselves and others in employment, while continuing to move the materials we need around the country.  The detail of the Bill, however, will make it more and more difficult for them to stay on the road.Provisions like the one in the Bill that will provide for a new licensing system for test centres and authorised testers, as well as greater powers of enforcement through targeted roadside inspections and inspections of commercial operators' premises, treats people as if they are criminals.  The Government must appreciate that the vast majority of hauliers and those involved in the transport sector are highly respectable.  I never criticise the remarks of other Deputies because they have been elected just like me and are entitled to their opinions, but I heard someone refer yesterday to "dodgy transport providers".  Who, in the name of God, was that individual talking about?  I certainly do not know any "dodgy transport providers".  The individuals I know are respectable business people, contractors who are trying to make a living.There are other issues to be addressed in the Bill.  Under the regulations providing for roadside roadworthiness testing of CVR vehicles, the inspectors who will carry out the inspections will have the power to take the vehicle for a drive and remove it to a centre for inspection.Section 34(3) provides that there will be no liability in respect of anything done in good faith and without negligence by a CVR inspector.  I presume this means that if an inspector insists on having a vehicle driven away or if he takes it on himself to drive it away and if it is involved in an accident, he will not be held responsible.  The legislation indicates that those who will serve as CVR inspectors cannot previously have been convicted of murder.  What qualifications will these individuals be expected to possess?  If an inspector was about to jump into a commercial vehicle or lorry I owned, the first thing I would do would be to ask him where he served his time and I would then inquire as to the qualifications he possesses which permit him to test the vehicle.Section 34 (1)(a) provides that where a CVR inspector is a member of An Garda Síochána or is accompanied by a member of An Garda Síochána, powers are being provided to stop a vehicle and keep it stationary for a period that is reasonable for the purposes of carrying out an inspection under section 32.  Such a vehicle would have already passed an inspection under the existing rules and regulations.  It is proposed that innocent people who are trying to make a living are going to be stopped at the side of the road.  This is another layer of bureaucracy that will cause more hardship and impose even more expense on those who are already struggling to survive.  Under section 41, people who are currently struggling to fill their vehicles’ tanks with diesel will, on conviction on indictment, be liable to fines not exceeding €100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.The report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, found that testing standards are not applied uniformly throughout the country and that the current system has considerable administrative inefficiencies.  I completely disagree with these findings, which are an insult to the people responsible for testing commercial vehicles up to now.  Those who currently work in the test centres are well qualified and I respect the work they have been doing.  It is an insult to infer that in the past these individuals have not done their job properly.  What is being stated in this regard is wrong.The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that the driver licensing system should be modernised through centralising the function in one authority.  I thought we would have learned our lesson in this regard.  In that context, I wish to draw an analogy with what occurred in respect of the medical card system.  Medical cards used to be processed at centres throughout the country.  This was a local service that was working well and there was nothing wrong with it.  In their infinite wisdom, the previous and current Government thought it would be a good idea to centralise the entire system in Dublin.  Since then there has been nothing but chaos.  People have been obliged to wait months for their cards and documentation sent by post and information relating to people's applications have been lost.  Is it the intention that the service provided by local authorities in respect of the issuing of driving licences is not good enough and that centralising the system will improve matters?  History will show that what is being done in this regard is wrong.  I am of the view that local services are better because it is possible to engage directly with those who provide such services.  In time, the decision in this regard will be proven to have been both poor and unwise.  It is amazing that so many Members have been prepared to come before the House to warmly welcome that decision.  Deputy Mattie McGrath certainly did not welcome it and he highlighted many of the problems and issues that arise in respect of it.The explanatory memorandum indicates that the overall objective of the legislation is to improve the quality of commercial vehicles using Irish roads and thereby help improve road safety, reduce congestion and ensure fair competition.  Are those in the Department of the view that each day roadsides are littered with vehicles that have broken down?  It is now the exception rather than the rule to come across a vehicle that has broken down.  I accept, however, that commercial vehicles can break down.  Anything with an engine can break down and even people can do so.  Given the state of some of our roads, vehicles can break down in tunnels and elsewhere and this can give rise to a great deal of upset and chaos for a short period.  However, instances of this nature are the exception rather than the rule.  It is nonsense to state that what is proposed in the legislation is going to reduce congestion.  If the Government wants to reduce congestion, it should carry out improvements to more of our roads.  I have no difficulty with the introduction of the plastic card driving licence.The explanatory memorandum also indicates that "A partial adoption of the measures would not reap the financial and safety benefits that are expected".  Why are we seeking to obtain a financial advantage on foot of this legislation?  Are motorists not incurring enough costs at present in the context of keeping their vehicles on the road?  The Government appears intent on raising an additional €4.5 million from these hard-pressed motorists.When the motorway from Dublin to Cork was built, the Road Safety Authority had been already established.  Why in heaven's name did it not, in the interests of safety, ensure a proper filling station was in place along the route in order that lorry drivers and others using it could pull in, refuel, have a cup of tea or coffee and a sandwich, have a rest and then recommence their journeys?  It was only due to a massive investment on the part of the highly-respected Liam and Donal Fitzpatrick and their family that a state-of-the-art service station was put in place at junction 14 on the Dublin-Cork motorway.  They did not receive support from the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority or any other body in respect of this matter.  The Fitzpatricks did all the work themselves and they are now providing an excellent service for those who wish to stop en route.  The Road Safety Authority was, to coin a phrase, asleep at the wheel when the motorway to which I refer was being constructed.  The authority should have foreseen the need for a services area when the project was being developed.The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:It has been estimated that 208 full time equivalent staff in MTOs are involved in dealing with driver licences across the country.  Proceeding with the centralised model will have implications for staff numbers.  The new arrangement would require considerably less staff to operate. On the face of it, therefore, a significant number of staff in local authorities will be available for redeployment within the system when the necessary numbers transfer to the centralised model.What the memorandum does not indicate, however, is what will happen when those to whom it refers retire.  Will the local authorities employ replacements for them?  I am of the view that they will not do so.  The authorities will indicate that such staff are not needed because the service has been centralised.  Is it not the case that local authorities have lost enough already?  Responsibility for water services is to be transferred to Irish Water and many of them are, in a way, losing their housing sections.  Now, the system for issuing driving licences is to be taken from them.  There is a continuing process of undermining the local authorities, which have done excellent work over the years and the staff of which have given great service to the State.  The number of people working for local authorities will continue to decrease and that is being admitted in the explanatory memorandum.In the event that anyone might form the view that, in the context of my contribution to the debate on this Bill, I have a disregard for safety, I wish to put matters straight.  I occupy a very strong position when it comes to discussing road safety.  Some 21 years ago I was involved in a serious road accident.  I spent four and a half years in rehabilitation.  At one point I thought that I would never walk properly again.  I am glad I survived my accident. It saddens me to think of those who were involved in accidents and who did not survive.  We are doing our part for road safety but one has to ensure we do not put our hauliers off the road.  Haulage companies from England - one sees them on the roads every day - are coming here to compete with Irish companies and they are beating them because of the massive expenses our hauliers suffer.  Do we want these indigenous companies that are giving employment to be forced off the roads and their workers put on the dole queues?  I do not want this to happen.This Bill, I believe, goes too far.  It is not as though there is no regulation in place already.  It is not as though people can drive a lorry without having it properly tested between the MOTs and the DOEs and all the other different tests, along with the Garda enforcing the rules of the road.  In introducing this Bill, are we saying the Garda is not doing its job in this area?  Are we insinuating the delivery of service in testing the vehicles was not up to standard because it was not uniform?  Are we proposing to centralise all testing facilities in Dublin, Limerick and Cork resulting in those needing to get agricultural or commercial vehicles tested having to travel many miles?  We are going too far with the legislation.The Road Safety Authority, RSA, is praised for the work it has done so far.  If its work has saved one life, off course it should be commended.  However, one must also highlight some of the effects of changes in road safety regulations made over the past several years.  For example, a person travelling to a local pub, having a pint and driving home after that is now out of the question and not to be heard of.  Instead, we now have a massive social problem in that people in rural areas are staying at home and suffering from depression as a result of some of the rules introduced in road safety in recent years.  I am glad to have had the chance to register my concerns about this.We have people who have worked very hard to build up small haulage businesses.  They might not be creating many jobs, some times only one, but that is the backbone of Ireland - the man and woman in such a small business who create one job for themselves and probably another for a family member or a neighbour.  They are the people this Government should nurture and support.  Last week, I was very disappointed there was not more of a favourable response to the Private Members' Bill to reduce fuel prices.  Fuel is now at a ridiculous price.  How many Deputies realise that it costs €1,475 to fill an average articulated lorry with fuel today?  If it were only half that price, €700, it would be a lot of money that could assist those small haulage companies.  These people are already struggling with the high costs of taxing their vehicles, tyres, wages and insurance.  The Government's mantra is about creating new jobs.  Will it do everything it can to keep those working in this industry in employment and not legislate them off the road?

The introduction of plastic card driver licences is a modern move which should have been in place many years ago.  I commend the Minister and his staff on introducing this new type of licence.  We will also have a more efficient administrative and management system for driver licensing.  The local authorities managed them heretofore but this new system will give the RSA a more enhanced and involved role, an agency with a good track record in general road safety improvement.  I recognise the role played by the RSA, the local authorities, the Garda, road traffic organisations such as the AA and, more importantly, the general public in improving road safety and in the reduction of road deaths.Commercial vehicles, especially, require enhanced safety standards.  In the case of buses, we have seen some tragic accidents with some fatalities.  It is only right that we have in place the highest possible standards and inspection systems for such vehicles.  Heavy goods vehicles, particularly those which carry dangerous cargoes such as chemicals, gases and oil, must have the highest of safety standards applied to them.  The potential damage such vehicles could create if anything went wrong would be devastating.  For these reasons, I welcome the improvements the Bill will bring to this area.An old hobby-horse of mine is the lack of adequate rest and service stations on our national road network and motorways.  While the M1 from Dublin to Belfast is well serviced, the road on which I travel most frequently, the M9 from Dublin to Waterford consisting of 100 miles, has no online service or rest station.  A station has been proposed in the general Kilcullen area but no progress has been made of late.  The Irish Road Haulage Association also complains about the lack of adequate service and rest stations.  Truck drivers must stop when they need rest.  Fatigue and the lack of toilet facilities for drivers, however, needs to be addressed.  I often see large articulated lorries, as well as buses, pulled over on hard shoulders, where people are forced to go to the toilet.  Otherwise, they would have to go miles offline which is not an appropriate option.The N25, which traverses County Waterford and runs from Rosslare to Cork, also does not have adequate service and rest stations.  The National Roads Authority's  guidelines for planning authorities, produced only in January 2012, encourage lorries to go offline into towns and villages to use such stations.  The reality on the ground is that many of these smaller and traditional service stations are closed.  In any event, they are too small for large lorries to manoeuvre into.The NRA guidelines state:A proliferation of service area facilities along rural sections of national roads and/or associated junctions, where the maximum speed limit applies, would create significant safety risks and affect the level of service available to road users, as well as impact on the viability and vitality of existing urban settlements.  In general sufficient road side facilities exist on non-motorway national road network.This paragraph is outdated, inadequate and does not address needs on non-national roads.  Many garages and service areas in small towns and villages have closed and I do not see how this paragraph will improve road safety, as there are no places for people to stop, especially long-distance lorry drivers who, by law, need to rest adequately.There is a need for the National Roads Authority, NRA, local authorities and the Department to consider this document again in order to try in a real effort to identify areas where it is acceptable to have such service stations.  The document is inadequate.  I can quote from a real case in which an application was made for a service station on the N25 in County Waterford, where there are few facilities for commercial vehicles.  Waterford city has now been bypassed and much good work has been done in making road improvements.  However, there are no service stations or rest areas for the drivers of large articulated lorries.As a solution, local authorities could strategically zone identified areas along national roads.  That would at least allow preliminary exploration of the need for service areas.  We should not have a service station at every crossroads and junction 100 metres apart, but we should have a planned and strategic approach to this important matter.  I will continue to lobby and discuss the matter until something is done.The road network, including local, regional and national routes, should be managed more professionally from an asset management perspective.  There should be an electronic mapping system for all roads.  Although some local authorities may have them, there is no central data system or asset management.  There should be digital mapping with records of maintenance, clearing of gullies and inlets, dangerous junctions and accident sites.  There should be an oversight system to consider all of these issues which would not depend on the local knowledge of overseers and council workers.  We have lost many of these overseers and with them much local knowledge of inlets and gullies.  When they are blocked, roads can be damaged and we throw good money after bad in trying to repair and maintain them because the water cannot escape.  As with utilities like water and electricity etc., the roads should be managed with a professional system.  The Department and the Minister have a role to play.  Although local authorities manage their own systems, we should examine the possibility of having a more efficient national system to oversee the expenditure of public moneys on road maintenance in a more efficient manner.We should always recognise the need to regularly revisit the issue of road safety.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's presence in the House.  He is a rural Deputy and would accept and acknowledge the need for continued investment in rural roads.  I also commend him for his efforts to date in maintaining rural transport networks.  It is important that nobody is isolated in this small country of ours.  We should maintain as far as possible a safe road traffic network.

I echo Deputy Paudie Coffey's sentiments.  I like Deputy Michael Healy-Rae who, unfortunately, has left the Chamber, but I have rarely heard such a bizarre contribution since entering the Dáil.  I readily accept that there has been a great reduction in staffing levels in local authorities, particularly outdoor staff who deal with the road network across the country, and I would like to see more people employed in that area.  Nevertheless, the notion that we retain staff previously employed in inspection centres for commercial vehicle road testing beggars belief.The Deputy also made some strange veiled references to some of the road safety legislation introduced in the past few years and argued that it was having a negative impact in rural communities.  The reality is that the statistics speak for themselves; there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of fatalities and serious accidents on the roads.  That has not come about by accident; there has been a concerted effort to change attitudes among the general public and excellent work done by the Road Safety Authority and other stakeholders.  I commend those involved for the change in attitude that has occurred in recent years, during which there has been a noticeable improvement in road safety.  I welcome any measure that will see 200 more people alive at the end of the year; there are 200 fewer fatalities a year on the road now than there were ten years ago.  Measures and legislation that have such a dramatic and positive impact have to be welcomed.I echo Deputy Paudie Coffey's views on the introduction of the new plastic driving licence, which will brings us into line with existing European legislation.  It will come into effect across the European Union within the next two years.  I wonder if it will contain more information than in the current format.  We live in an age when everybody has cards for everything and there are personal identification numbers for this, that and the other.  There is a strong argument to be made that the driving licence should contain other useful information; in addition to a picture of the driver, it might contain the PPS number and almost act as an identification card.  This may not be possible at the introduction stage, but there is a strong argument to be made for this to happen over time.Unlike Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, following a couple of very serious and tragic bus accidents, resulting in significant loss of life, I see a need to examine the licensing of testing centres for commercial vehicles and a requirement to introduce uniform standards across the country.  That is why consultants are being engaged.  Unlike the Deputy, I see it as perfectly reasonable to expect that if a vehicle is tested in Kilkenny, it should be subject to the same standards of testing as if tested in Carlow.  Within most counties there are several test centres and it is essential that the same standards apply across the board.  That is partly what was identified in the report.  This legislation is positive in that regard.I raise with the Minister of State a point brought to my attention on the test centres which are private operations.  A number of such centres are operated by family haulage companies or small businesses and there is concern that people may invest significant amounts in upgrading facilities, with no guarantee that they will retain the licence to test in the future.  A guarantee cannot be given, as a centre may not be up to standard.  I seek reassurance for those who have borrowed, in many instances to invest in a facility which is state of the art.  If they meet the required standards into the future, these family businesses should not be forced into a position where they will lose the licence because of other vagaries of the system.  This could have serious detrimental consequences for those involved in the sector.I would like to raise a number of other issues with the Minister of State.  A consistent bugbear of mine and of many other Members for years is the issue of speed limits.  I heard a radio report about the introduction of a more uniform pattern to such limits across the country.  A uniform system of vehicle testing is being introduced and despite the fact that more than 40 local authorities propose speed limits in their areas, there needs to be uniformity in how they are implemented.  There are obvious and famous examples on major roads.  I live on the outskirts of Waterford city near the dual carriageway that links Waterford with New Ross and Limerick.  The speed limit on this dual carriageway is 50 km/h whereas the speed limit on the road on which I grew up five miles away which has grass growing on the middle of it is 80 km/h.  That is a ridiculous case, of which every Member has examples, and that should not be allowed to continue.I echo Deputy Coffey's comments regarding the need for service facilities to be provided on motorways.  I also use the M9 to travel to Dublin.  It has been a great and welcome development, which has shortened journey times and dramatically improved connectivity between the south east and our capital city.  However, it was short sighted in the extreme not to make provision for service facilities when the motorway was designed.  The same applies to other motorway routes.  These facilities would be operated by private operators and, therefore, the Exchequer would not incur significant expense.  It should be ensured that such facilities are provided as a matter of priority.We do not have enough outdoor local authority staff to maintain roads but significant local road improvements should be carried out privately leaving these staff the task of maintaining the standard of the roads and ensuring the huge investment made in them is worthwhile.  That is not the case currently.  Good work is done and, as soon as torrential rain arrives, it is washed away.  A change can be made in that regard.Hauliers are under significant pressure.  Last week, a Private Members' Bill on fuel costs was debated in the House.  It is ironic and hypocritical that a party that was in a government that increased excise on fuel in its final two budgets would come along a year later and seek an overnight reduction with a straight face.  The Minister for Finance is the main man in this area but it is imperative that something be done urgently for those who use fuel commercially, perhaps in the form of a rebate.  The Exchequer is losing significant revenue because of hauliers and others buying fuel abroad and the illegal washing of fuel, which is sold in many locations.  This phenomenon used to be reserved for the Border area but washed fuel is sold all over the country nowadays.  A small change to provide for a fuel rebate could have positive impact on the Exchequer because of the revenue being lost currently.  People who want to obey the law would very much welcome such a rebate.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The genesis to the legislation was a number of serious bus accidents in Kentstown, County Meath and Clara, County Offaly, and every speaker needs to be conscious of its background.  There is a need for consistency in the testing of commercial vehicles.  I compliment the RSA on achieving the target it set in the road safety strategy for annual road fatalities 12 months ahead of schedule.  The target for the end of 2012 was 252 road fatalities annually.  The authority will be significantly under this target by the end of this year based on fatalities to date.  One fatality or serious injury on Irish roads is one too many but a great deal of good work has been done by the authority and Mr. Brett and his colleagues should be commended on that. Like every other Member, I am critical of the fact that the RSA is not directly answerable to the House in the context of parliamentary questions and so on.  However, as an organisation, it has been responsive to individual queries that have been raised.  I do not always agree with the response I receive but the staff have always made themselves available and responded in a prompt manner to matters I have raised.I am concerned that the legislation opens the door for secondary legislation and the detail normally required in primary legislation has not been provided in this Bill and it will only be following its enactment that we will have sight of the secondary legislation.  Sadly, most of that will go through the House on the nod.  I hope the Minister will agree on Committee Stage to amend the legislation to ensure it requires a positive vote of the House to enact the regulations provided for in it.The proposal to establish a single authority to monitor testing standards is welcome and positive and this will, hopefully, ensure consistency throughout the country.  However, it is also important that the range of test centres is maintained because competition is needed between them to keep down prices and that will not happen if there is only one provider throughout the State, similar to the national car test.  The operators must remain independent and spread out geographically.  There are significant costs involved if commercial vehicle users have to travel significant distances to have their vehicles tested and have certificates issued.With regard to standards, an issue relating to the national car test will become an issue for commercial vehicle users on foot of this legislation.  The issue was brought to my attention by the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation as it concerned a young child.  The child who is fragile has a number of difficulties.  One is that the child's eyes are sensitive not only to sunlight but also to daylight due to the child's illness.  The HSE paid for specially tinted windows to be put in a vehicle to alleviate the child's medical condition.  The vehicle is four years old and had to undergo the national car test recently but it failed because of the tinted windows.  The national car test centre referred the case to the RSA on appeal and the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation contacted the authority, which refused the appeal because flexibility is not provided in existing statutory instruments to deal with such cases.  Unless this issue can be resolved, the child will be unable to travel in the vehicle for outings, hospital appointments and so forth.  It has huge implications for the child who is now restricted to the home, despite the taxpayer having paid, through the HSE, for the windows to be tinted in the first place.  This issue will also arise if a child is being transported to school in a commercial vehicle.  Although the taxpayer will have paid to have the windows tinted, when the vehicle is presented for the NCT, it will be refused.  The difficulty is that the current national car test regulations state excessively tinted windscreens or front side windows present a significant safety hazard for vehicle drivers and their occupants.  I fully accept that in the vast majority of cases this is not an issue and that there is a safety aspect.  However, I put it to the Minister of State that people of very large size are exempt under the law from wearing safety belts if they physically cannot close the belt.  For a physical reason, therefore, a person can be exempt from wearing a safety belt, yet, also for a physical reason, a person's vehicle will not pass the NCT because of an adjustment made owing to a particular medical condition.  There needs to be flexibility built into the system in order that, where there are medical or safety reasons, discretion can be provided for.  I ask the Minister to deal with this issue.  The RSA is looking into it and will undertake a review, although I do not know when it will be completed.  The vehicle in question is off the road, however, and the child is housebound because the NCT certificate cannot be issued.One of the provisions in the Bill is that the RSA will take over the issuing of driving licences.  I bring to the Minister's attention an issue that needs to be addressed in the context of the Bill, namely, the storing of basic emergency data on the new credit card-type driving licence to be introduced next year.  It will include data such as who should be contacted in the case of emergency - an ICE number - and basic medical data on long-term medical conditions such as diabetes, allergies to particular medicines, blood group and so on.  This information is vital in treating someone at the scene of an accident or in an emergency and must be included in the new driving licence which must also include the existing provision in regard to organ donation.  Under the proposed legislation, the card will automatically carry a photo, the name and address and date of birth of the holder, information on the licence type and details of the issuing authority.  It will also carry a record of any penalty points or endorsements incurred and allow gardaí at a checkpoint to examine the driver's record, whereas, currently, a garda who stops a motorist cannot tell from examining the licence if the driver has been disqualified.  While this will benefit gardaí and the authorities, we should make information available that could directly benefit the individual who holds the card.  While it is not possible under the EU directive on driving licences to combine the new licence with the social welfare identity card, it should be possible to include emergency and basic medical data in it.  Having immediate access to such basic medical data at the scene of an accident or in an emergency can be the difference between life and death for some and for others, it can have an impact on their length of stay in hospital.  Making such data available with the consent of the driving licence holder will, therefore, not only save lives but also save the health service money.The same applies to ICE numbers.  It is a simple concept whereby the new electronic licence will store contact information in order that paramedics can contact a family member or friend in the event of an emergency.  The emergency services have been promoting the use of ICE numbers on mobile phones, which is a welcome development.  The difficulty is that most people now have smartphones with security numbers; therefore, it is impossible for the emergency services to access the data in order to access the ICE number.  If the data were included in the credit card-type driving licence, they would be easily accessible to the emergency services and gardaí at the scene of an accident.  The vast majority of emergency victims are not able to provide contact information for emergency workers, with research in the United Kingdom showing that fewer than one in five carries details of the person they would like to have telephoned following a serious accident.  Taking these two steps would ensure paramedics at the scene of an accident or in an emergency would have access to both basic and more detailed medical information which would directly benefit those being treated by the emergency services.  I urge the Minister to consider including this provision in the legislation.It is important that local access to the driving licence is continued under the new system.  People have access through the local authority network in order to submit their application and have their driving licence issued.  This local element must be continued under any new structure the RSA introduces.  The staff in the local authorities have the skill-set to deal with this service and, while it may not be possible to retain all of the staff operating the service, it should be possible to maintain the network and some of these skills to be used in the provision of services in local areas where people are used to submitting their applications and having them processed.I want to deal with the issue of fuel prices, as well as the wider issue of cost.  This legislation will result in increased costs, not immediately in regard to the new test but for the future in that it provides for additional statutory instruments to be introduced to set new standards.  I urge the Minister to ensure any new standard being introduced carries a clear safety benefit and that we are not just concocting standards because it would be nice to have them in place.  What we need is clear standards with a clear connection to safety and accident records.  In tandem, there must be direct discussions with the insurance industry to ensure whatever savings are made result in a return to the road haulage industry and motorists in general.  We have seen the industry absorb some of the savings made in recent years owing to the reduction in the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads.An issue which will shortly come to a head concerns vintage vehicles.  While this is not directly under the control of the Minister for Transport, it is a transport issue and connected to the proposed off-the-road tax of approximately €30 which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is considering.  There is such a system in place in the United Kingdom, but there is no tax charge.  A person registers the vehicle as being off the road to deal with the issue of anomalies in motor tax, and if the vehicle is off the road, he or she does not pay a charge.  The idea behind motor tax is that the driver pays for the use of the road in order that local authorities can repair and replace road surfaces.  If a vehicle is off the road, why are we paying tax towards the cost of repairing roads?  It does not make sense.I specifically want to focus on the issue of vintage vehicles.  Across the country not only vintage car clubs but also commercial vintage vehicle clubs do a huge amount of fund-raising.  In my local area the South Roscommon Vintage Club which involves agricultural vehicles raises money every second or third weekend for many local charities.  In fact, in the period from September to December 2011, vintage clubs around Ireland donated over €280,000 to local charities, an astronomical sum.  Surely we should recognise this.  There are already exemptions in the motor tax legislation.  Surely we can get around the problem relating to vintage vehicles which are exempt in many countries in Europe.  I realise there is a difficulty, but there will always be a difficulty in this country because someone will always find a loophole.  I am confident, however, that it is within the capabilities of the officials in the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to regulate to ensure there will be no loopholes.I refer to the issue of fuel prices which are going out of control for all commercial operators.  I accept the Government does not have a bottomless pit of money to deal with the issue.  However, the additional VAT collected on fuel and fuel laundering are costing motorists approximately €1,000 every minute.  Up to €500 million a annum is being lost through fuel laundering, a significant loss to the Exchequer, one that must be addressed urgently.  I realise the Government is in talks with the British Government on the issue.  However, we must put in place a system, whereby if additional savings are made, motorists will receive a return.  If this was to materialise, there would be a direct incentive for motorists to report suspected cases of fuel laundering to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is a difficult problem to police, but such vital information would be of direct benefit to the Revenue Commissioners and motorists.  Everyone would win, including the Exchequer.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I extend my thanks to all Deputies for their contributions.  This is important legislation.  I have been pleased by the approach, consistent with successive Dáileanna, whereby parties have worked together in the area of road safety.  The issue has not been divisive politically and has been worked on closely by all parties.  I have been encouraged by the support for the Bill and I hope it will be enacted and the measures implemented without delay once the legislation has been passed by both Houses.I trust Deputies will agree there is no doubt we have witnessed vast improvements in road safety in recent years and the country is seeing the benefits of such improvements with ever-reducing numbers of road fatalities.  There are many reasons for this.  Vehicles are manufactured with the safety imperative in mind and the roads on which we drive are better and safer as well.  Government policy has been continually supported through various initiatives which seek to alter driver behaviour, including the introduction of safety cameras and the roll-out of the penalty points system.  The law has put the onus on road users to adopt a more responsible attitude, and for the most part the response has been positive.The Bill is the third tranche of road safety legislation that has been through the Houses in the past year.  In 2011, the Government reduced the drink driving limit to zero for all drivers, with an effective zero tolerance for learner, novice and professional drivers.  The mandatory alcohol testing provisions were also extended in 2011.  Enforcement by the Garda has also played a significant part in road safety improvements, and this work has been robustly supported by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  A great deal of the progress made during the past five or six years can be attributed to the role of the Road Safety Authority.  The authority has brought road safety issues to the forefront of national debate through education, awareness and the drive to raise standards throughout the road safety sector generally.  The Bill acknowledges the fundamental role the Road Safety Authority plays in this area and reinforces this role in respect of commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing and driver licensing.With the support of Members for this legislation we can look forward to further progress in the road safety agenda.  This Bill is only one element of a wide-ranging programme that seeks to avoid tragedies involving commercial vehicles.  We will never be able to control everything that occurs on the roads but we can make every effort to reduce the chances of such tragedies occurring.I wish to address the issues raised by some Deputies.  Deputy Dooley asked about a possible agreement with Northern Ireland on penalty points.  Under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, asked that officials from both jurisdictions examine the possibility of mutual recognition of penalty points.  Discussions have begun to try to reach agreement.  Four traffic offences will be targeted on a pilot basis: speeding, drink driving, the non-wearing of seat belts and use of mobile phones while driving.  The systems for applying penalty points and the supporting legislation are different on both parts of the island and it may take some time to arrive at a mutually acceptable position.  However, the work is ongoing and every effort will be made to reach agreement as quickly as possible.Some Deputies referred to the possibility that drivers from outside the State are dealt with more leniently than Irish truck drivers.  The Road Traffic Act 2010 provides for a payment deposit scheme for non-resident drivers who have been stopped for committing offences.  The scheme provides for the payment of a deposit by the driver or the impoundment of a vehicle until the deposit is paid.  Officials from the Department are working with the Garda and the RSA to agree arrangements for the practical application of the provisions of the Act in order that non-resident drivers or companies will not be given any competitive advantages.Deputy Dooley referred to road safety education and developments at junior certificate level in schools.  The Road Safety Authority's policy is to deliver road user education with a cumulative, age-appropriate approach, commencing in preschool settings, through to third level and into community settings.  Road safety education ensures all road users develop appropriate attitudes and safe behaviours.  The RSA resources are not compulsory at present but they are aligned with the relevant curriculum strands in each educational setting.  It would be of significant benefit if these programmes were made compulsory within the school curriculum.  The proposed development of the junior cycle programme presents opportunities for the authority to further develop its existing road safety programme, entitled Streetwise.  The programme could be developed to take advantage of the proposed short courses or it could be integrated into the priority learning units outlined in the document entitled Towards a Framework for Junior Cycle.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has spoken to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, on this matter on many occasions.Several Deputies queried the overall rationale for the legislation and asked about how the new system would operate.  As I remarked in my opening statement, one trigger for the reform of commercial vehicle roadworthiness was the Kentstown bus crash in which five young school girls lost their lives prematurely.  The comprehensive review conducted following the tragedy found that a radical transformation of the commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing service was required and that this reform would be best undertaken by a central body.  The RSA was tasked with undertaking this reform.The overall objective is to introduce a far more robust system of testing with higher standards that will be consistent throughout the country.  The credentials for operators who wish to become involved in testing vehicles will be stringently examined before approval is given.  Any company or person is entitled to apply for the appropriate authorisation.  The tests will be supported by random checks of vehicles at premises and roadside checks.  The outcome will be a step change in the way we test and maintain our commercial vehicle fleet.  It will enhance safety on our roads and improve the reputation of hauliers at home and abroad.Compliant operators have nothing to fear from these provisions.  Indeed, they have welcomed them.  Those operating outside the law and gaining a competitive advantage as a result will be exposed and brought within the system through enforcement.  Enforcement will be targeted through the use of a risk rating system.  Risk ratings will be purely evidence-based and constructed on the basis of roadside, premises and test history inspections.  Infringements and non-compliance will be accorded a numeric value.  Converting the information captured will be undertaken by a purpose-designed computer program that will calculate a rating for each operator.  Factors including the seriousness of the infringement, the number of infringements and the number of checks will be taken into consideration in determining the relative compliance of each operator.Certain roadside infringements pose more of a significant safety risk than others.  For example, problems with steering or braking systems create more of an immediate danger than an operator not correctly displaying a certificate of roadworthiness.  A time factor will also be included.  This means an operator who commits a high number of offences in a short period will be perceived as posing a greater short-term risk than an operator who commits a number of lesser offences over a longer period.  More recent infringements will be accorded a higher weighting than older ones.  It is intended that rated operators will have access to their numerical score and how the score is comprised.  The system will provide a fair and accurate indication of the safety of the operator's fleet and the operator's compliance with the legislation.  Operators who adhere to good practices, hold appropriate records, observe the tachograph and the rules on driver hours and consistently maintain their vehicles to the required standards will reap the benefits as compliance and enforcement activities will be primarily focused on higher risk operators.Some Deputies raised concerns about the transfer of responsibility for driver licensing from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority.  The system of local authorities managing all aspects of driver licensing has served the country well over the years but procedures and processes have changed in recent years and, other than issuing the licence, local authorities are no longer involved in the management or update of the licence details.  These procedures will change fundamentally with the introduction of the plastic card licence next year.  It would not be feasible or economically sensible to expect that every local authority would have the facility to produce a plastic card licence.  The security aspects alone would make this impractical.  For this reason, the licence production unit will be centralised.Following on from that, it makes more sense to centralise the processing arrangements.  That will bring consistency to the handling and management of applications and will eliminate the variable practices and inefficiencies of the current system.  In addition, transfer of responsibility to the RSA will mean the public will have a one-stop-shop arrangement in respect of driver licences.  Issues from theory tests to driving tests to driver licences will be handled by the authority.  As well as enhancing the efficiency of the operation, this will lead to clarity and convenience for the public who will have just one State body with which to deal in regard to all driver licence issues.The RSA is at various stages of conducting procurement processes, first, for the production of plastic card licences, second, for the processing of applications and, third, for front office customer service operations.  Some staff from local authorities who are currently working on driver licence issues will be given the opportunity to transfer to the RSA.  All other relevant local authority staff will be redeployed within the local authority structure and, in a time of scarce resources, this opportunity will be welcomed by local authority managers.  No staff will be made redundant as a result of this transfer.Under the new system, we should be able to reduce significantly the number of people processing licences and move from a loss making arrangement, which costs local authorities money, to one that will be slightly profitable for the RSA.With regard to commercial vehicle roadworthiness, CVR, a number of Deputies mentioned approaches from the IMPACT trade union.  Any redeployment of local authority staff, in regard to both driver licensing and CVR, is fundamentally a matter for their employers, the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Staff members are dealt with under the Croke Park Agreement and therefore there is no question of compulsory redundancies.  In some cases there will be redeployment to the RSA, particularly in the north west.  In other cases, staff will be redeployed.As the number of staff in local authorities has reduced dramatically in recent years, more so than in most parts of the public sector, the fact  we can now redeploy a significant number of people from laminating and processing licences to other council activities can be seen only as a positive step.  In regard to CVR, 22 staff have already moved to the RSA and are working to advance the CVR reform programme.I should clarify, however, that while the approach is to centralise the administration and management of the CVR testing system, the commercial vehicle test network will continue to be run by individual privately owned test centres located across the country.  There are currently 140 of these test centres in operation. The Bill will not change this approach and does not provide for a single service provider in the State.As Deputies will be aware, the primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a more robust legislative framework for CVR testing, which will support consistency, accuracy and impartiality across the testing system.  The RSA will demand consistency in testing through the centralised supervisory approach.  The RSA will outsource some of the work on technical inspections and it is likely that this will be delivered consistently across the country in a service that is delivered, as mentioned already, by 140 privately owned test centres. The new regime, upon commencement of the provisions, will apply to the existing test centres and the necessary transitional provision for this arrangement is provided under section 10 of the Bill.  These existing test centres will be required to apply for a renewal of their authorisation within 18 months of the commencement of section 10.  Any application that was being processed but not determined prior to the commencement of this legislation will be also covered by this section.A number of Deputies asked about rest areas and parking facilities available to hauliers on motorways.  Currently, there are three NRA motorway services areas open to the public, two on the M1 and one on the N4.  Negotiations with tenderers for a public private partnership scheme to operate service areas on the N6 near Athlone, the N9 near Kilcullen and the M11 near Gorey are at an advanced stage.  The Department is also aware of two other services areas opened recently, one on the N7 near Mayfield and the other on the N8 near Cashel.  Other work is also being conducted by the Department, working with the bodies, in regard to that area.Deputy John Paul Phelan raised the issue of speed limits.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, recently announced a review of speed limits throughout the country and a group has been set up to work on that.  The group is expected to report back to the Minister before the end of the year.Deputy Ross raised the issue of licence holders.  I would point out that learner holders are still required to have a fully qualified driver with them but it is a matter for the Garda to enforce this legislation.Deputy Naughten raised a number of issues.  On plastic card licences, we are confined initially to including only what is provided for in the European Union directive as regards the information on that licence.  However, the RSA will include a microchip in the licence on which vital information as referenced by the Deputy can be stored.

This legislation provides the groundwork for a radical change in the commercial vehicle and haulage sectors in Ireland and it will send a strong signal internationally that our country is striving to achieve the highest industry standards, particularly in regard to roadworthiness.Following the enactment of the Bill, we can also look forward to the introduction of a plastic card licence next January, which will be managed by the RSA. People are required by law to carry a licence when driving and this credit card style licence will make it easier and more convenient for drivers to comply with such a legal requirement.  Drivers will be more inclined to carry this new type of licence, which will undoubtedly help An Garda Síochána in exercising its duties as they relate to the Road Traffic Acts.It is our wish to have the Bill enacted as quickly as possible to ensure its provisions can be commenced at an early stage.  Strong legislation has been proven to reduce death and injury on our roads and this Bill should not be any different.  An overhaul of the commercial vehicle testing system is long overdue and it is hoped reform of the system will begin in earnest this summer.  I thank the Deputies for facilitating the introduction of the Bill in the Dáil and for their generous and considered contributions to this debate.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	365	This is straightforward legislation.  While it will not resolve all the problems arising in the area of protection of employees, its enactment would immediately strengthen and extend legislation aimed at protecting workers who have been made redundant.  The Bill is supported by a number of the largest trade unions, including Unite, SIPTU and Mandate.  Speaking at a briefing on the Bill earlier this week, John Douglas of Mandate stated his union was faced with a serious and growing problem of employers ceasing to trade and walking away from their responsibilities to their employees.  When a company ceases to trade and is placed in the hands of a receiver or liquidator as opposed to being wound up, workers are left in limbo as regards pay arrears, holiday pay and pay in lieu of notification.  They do not have recourse to the insolvency fund which is only available when companies become insolvent.  In cases of insolvency, employees' claims have to be given preference by the receiver or liquidator and if the company does not have assets or capital, payment is made from the insolvency fund.  The current position would be changed by the Bill, which proposes to give the Minister the power to declare companies insolvent for the purpose of meeting employees' claims.I welcome the provision to extend the notification period for collective redundancies and measures aimed at reducing the 76 to 80 week delay in securing a hearing at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is outrageous that a backlog of 29,000 statutory redundancy claims has built up, particularly given the pace with which the Government facilitated employers' demands on issues such as joint labour committees and the introduction in the budget of more special tax breaks for high earners at the suggestion of powerful, big business interests and in the face of reservations expressed by the Revenue Commissioners.The Labour Party has argued that a review body has been established and legislation will be forthcoming on foot of its findings.  Legislation on the protection of employees is urgently required.  It must be made loud and clear to employers that they cannot treat workers in the manner in which many of them have behaved in recent cases.  When a Bill was proposed recently to address the implications of the X case, the Government argued that a review body was addressing the issue.  We will closely monitor the position to ensure that, unlike in the case of joint labour committees where the Government reduced rather than enhanced workers' rights, any legislation introduced on foot of the review body's findings will enhance workers' rights.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	366	In the year since the Government came to office we have had a litany of cases in which workers were treated in a disgraceful fashion by rogue and unscrupulous employers.  Workers at Jane Norman have still not secured justice, while workers in Vita Cortex, La Senza, Lagan Brick and Game were forced to occupy their places of employment to bring their cases to the attention of members of the public and the Government and secure some justice.  More recently, as I noted earlier, we had the disgraceful treatment of Irish Cement workers by one of the largest and most profitable companies in the country.  Perhaps the lack of concern shown on that issue is related to the close relations Irish Cement has always enjoyed with the political establishment, going back to the days when Cement Roadstone organised handouts for Charles Haughey and his family.I find it amazing that this Government, which has shown so much enthusiasm, energy and vigour in protecting the interests of bankers, bondholders and the super-wealthy in this country and in Europe, shows no enthusiasm for and a complete disinterest in the plight of workers who have been treated in a despicable fashion.  Since the La Senza and Vita Cortex disputes began, Deputies on this side have been calling on it to introduce legislation to protect workers from this type of despicable treatment.  While we saw crocodile tears and heard words of concern, we did not see any concrete action that would prevent a recurrence of such cases.  It should be clear to the Government at this stage that certain employers, particularly large multinational companies, are taking advantage of the climate of recession to do things to workers they would not have got away with in other circumstances.  What will the Government do about this?Sinn Féin accepts that its Bill addresses only some aspects of employee protection.  Nevertheless, the legislation should be supported in so far as it extends the minimum notice requirements when employers make workers redundant and requires the Employment Appeals Tribunal and Labour Court to respond more quickly to workers who are made redundant.  We also need a shift in gear from the Government.  It must show a political will to address the grievances of workers who are being treated in a despicable fashion.  I hope it will respond.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The protection of employees has been brought centre stage as a result of the recent cases highlighted by Deputies Joan Collins and Richard Boyd Barrett.  While this badly needed legislation does not claim to be a panacea, it is a step in the right direction.  If nothing else, it has focused attention on employee protection and forced the House to discuss the issue.The Government has been shamefully slow to address a growing scandal that is emerging from the economic difficulties we are enduring.  However, legislation alone will not sort out abuses by unscrupulous employers.  We have in place a body of legislation that is either being actively evaded or ignored by many employers.  In addition, the industrial relations machinery is so slow and toothless that unscrupulous employers are able to get away with their actions and are not called to account.  In that context and given that it was May Day yesterday, the trade union movement has a responsibility to organise and champion workers.  Rather than hanging on the coat-tails of politicians and expecting them to deliver, they should do the job trade unions were set up to do.That said, legislation has a role to play in this regard.  The Bill should proceed to Committee Stage at which point a number of additional measures should be considered.  The first of these relates to occupations, the only weapon available to workers who seek to meet the threat of closure and defend their interests.  I applaud the stance workers have taken in this regard.  While the forces of the State were not called to intervene in the cases of La Senza, Game and several other companies, the workers who occupied Thomas Cook premises to save their jobs were forcibly dragged out of the building by agents of the State.  The Government must provide legal immunity for workers who occupy places of employment in such circumstances, particularly where they have given a life of work to the company in question.  Such protection should be built into the legislation.A legal requirement should be also introduced to force companies to open their books.  This would allow claims of poverty to be examined and verified or otherwise.  We know such claims do not stand up in many instances.We have also had the appalling spectacle of organisations such as KPMG, which advised La Senza on how to breach the legislation and avoid its statutory responsibilities, securing contracts with Departments.  This type of doublespeak must stop and companies that engage in such practices should be excluded from all dealings with the State.Access to the Labour Court machinery must be also accelerated.  In terms of enforcement, what is the point in having a Labour Court adjudication if its rulings can be ignored, not only in the private sector but also by State companies and Departments?  There are three instances of the National Museum of Ireland ignoring Labour Court recommendations, as well as other State bodies.  If it is not led from the front, why would any private sector employer behave any differently?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I would like to use my speaking time to highlight an issue brought to my attention by Mr. Tom Dwyer, one of 20 workers who lost their jobs recently at H.W. Wilson when it was taken over by a larger American company called EBSCO.  That company was named in the 2011 Forbes list as one of the top 200 private companies in America, with revenue in that year of over €2 billion.  There was a dispute about the redundancy to be paid, and it went to the Labour Court.  The workers, in good faith, were happy with that.  The Labour Court found in favour of the workers and was quite critical of some of the claims made in the defence of EBSCO, and pointed out the obvious fact that the company would receive a 60% rebate from the State on the minimum statutory payment it was going to make.  The court recommended that all H.W. Wilson employees in Dublin should be paid an ex gratia payment of four weeks per year of service, inclusive of the statutory redundancy payment already received, as it was deemed to be in line with common practice in this industry.Sadly, EBSCO has ignored the court's ruling.  When the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was challenged here on the issue, he said that neither himself nor the Labour Court could compel companies to abide by the court recommendations as they were voluntary.  This was a big disappointment to the workers, who expected a bit more from him.  These companies come over here, we treat them well and we are glad that they provide work, but we expect our workers to be treated fairly in response.  It is not like EBSCO is a company in trouble or short of money.  It turned over revenue of more than €2 billion in 2011 and it has no moral right to refuse the workers a fair deal.  If the Government is not in a position even to pressure these companies on the Labour Court, why should we bother having a Labour Court in the first place?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I call Deputy Áine Collins to be followed by Deputy Ann Phelan, and then Deputies English, Maloney, Barry and Donohoe.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The issue of redundancy is, by its nature, very sensitive as an individual is losing his or her job.  When redundancies are announced, its effects on the individual are life changing.  This can result in many knock-on effects such as inability to pay a mortgage, insufficient funds for educating children and a total change in lifestyle, not to mention the psychological effects.  Redundancies can be particularly painful when they occur in the midst of a recession, where unemployment figures make it difficult for a person to get alternative work.For these reasons it is very important that we look very carefully at any suggestions that might improve the lot of workers who are being made redundant.  Indeed that is why there is already a raft of legislation which has evolved over the years to protect the rights of workers.  Unions, governments and employment organisations are constantly reviewing the regulations that govern redundancy to try to ensure the best possible outcome for those unfortunate enough to be placed in that position.Extending the notice period in cases where redundancies have to be made could have a negative impact on a business which is trying its best to survive and recover.  The impact would be felt by both the employees who are made redundant as well as those staying on.  It creates underlying negative moral issues in the workplace and this can have a long-lasting effect on the business.  There is also extensive European legislation which offers a further layer of protection to redundant workers.  Having acknowledged the importance of the objective of protecting redundant workers, it is important that this is achieved in a balanced way.  Looking at one of the original EU directives in 1998, the Commission notes the need for balanced economic and social developmentSinn Féin's rhetoric in every big issue of the day seems to be designed to promote Sinn Féin as a party rather than promote what is good for Ireland or its citizens.  This is true of its stance on the upcoming treaty, where its leaders are asking people to vote "No" on emotional issues without providing any solution as to how we fund the State after 2014 in the event of such a vote.  With this Bill, Sinn Féin is promoting soundbites which are not practical and which cannot be implemented in a balanced way.  As Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, stated: "Ultimately it could serve only to expose the taxpayer and employees to an additional burden, while also ironically acting as a chill factor to the creation of vitally necessary new employment in the State."The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is committed to introducing legislation and structures that will not only help to resolve difficulties being experienced by employees, but will also benefit the overall relationship between unions, employers, and government, with more structured and effective ways of resolving issues that arise.  The Minister last month announced the detail of his plans to establish a two tier employment rights and industrial relations structure.  Work has begun on drafting of the workplace relations Bill, which will be enacted in the third quarter of this year.  This will include measures to promote compliance and deter employers from risking non-compliance.  As well as providing improved services, these reforms will bring about significant savings for the Exchequer.I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, that the focus should be on providing improved mechanisms through which vindication of existing rights can be facilitated.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already shown his clear commitment to this objective.  For these reasons I will be voting against this Bill.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  Furthermore, I thank Sinn Féin for raising it in Private Members' time, though I fear it is unworkable.While the proposed legislation seeks to enhance the period of notice to workers that are being made redundant, current legislation provides cover for such problems, and the Government is making great progress already in this area.  I would like to acknowledge the work that has already been done by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the area of reforming employment rights, and also industrial relations mechanisms.  The Minister recently published a document which sets out the proposed shape of the new workplace relations structures that will be in place by the end of this year.  However, there is more to be done and the Government will lead the charge.The area of industrial relations has always been encased in red tape and bureaucracy, with arduous methods of seeking redress.  There have been long delays under the current system, in some cases of up to two years, in scheduling hearings and also delays in issuing decisions.  The Government is intent on replacing some of these outdated systems and implementing a new, quicker and more efficient way of seeking redress and providing enforcement.  Already improvements have been made and progress has been achieved.  For example, all first instance complaints are now being acknowledged, with the employer made aware within five days of the complaint being made.  Previously this process could take up to seven or eight months.   The aim is to target a period of just three months from the original complaint to the hearing and written decisions.  This has already been achieved in the case of the Rights Commissioner hearings.  It used to take an average of 142 days to schedule a hearing, but they are scheduled by the LRC in a matter of weeks.The establishment of the workplace relations commission will mean that two bodies will replace the current five.  Amalgamation shows a commitment to cut down on red tape and make this entire system fairer and quicker.  These are just a few things that have already been achieved by the Government and by the end of the year we will have much more.  We have a new workplace relations customer service, which provides for a point of contact for all employment rights and industrial relations information, among other things.  The early resolution service, which although only embryonic, will act as an alternative to adjudication, in the hope that parties can resolve the issue themselves with the help of a case resolution officer.In its first year of office, this Government has restored the minimum wage, invested over €500 million in our jobs initiative, reduced VAT in the tourism sector and set up the strategic investment fund to channel investment into the domestic economy.  This is what the Labour and Fine Gael Government has done; it is a matter of public record.Some trouble has arisen as a result of winding up orders from courts outside this jurisdiction that affect companies and workers operating within it.  Perhaps the answer to this is to frame some European legislation and perhaps the Government could follow up on this.  Those companies which are not based here but which operate in the Irish market, and therefore derive large profits from it, should not be given any contracts from any government or State bodies if they decide to break from normal employment practices in the Irish market.  The Sinn Féin Bill proposes amendments that offer no real improvements for workers.  Furthermore, the current structure provides support for those whose employer has become insolvent.The Opposition, and Sinn Féin, do not have a monopoly on concern for workers' rights.  Members of my family have been made redundant and been unemployed.  Let no one tell me I do not know what this is about.

It is strange we are debating a Bill to improve services for people who have been made redundant and relations between employees and employers while the proposers of the Bill are campaigning against a treaty that will bring stability to the country.  Stability is the best way to protect jobs and prevent redundancies.  The timing of this debate is amusing.I understand the sentiment of the Bill.  Every Deputy agrees that the more one can do to help employees and employee-employer relations the better, but there must also be a balance.  I have said on previous occasions that we must have a balance between the employer and employees.  As well as protecting jobs and putting services in place when people lose their jobs, we must also win and create new jobs.  We must create an environment that will help that.  A foreign employer considering investing in Ireland will ask a number of questions.  The first question will be how we voted in the fiscal treaty, because that is about stability and securing our position in Europe.  I will not dwell on that, but an outside employer will ask that question.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I am simply saying we should ask ourselves this question.  Would an employer, such as Sky or PayPal, who wanted to invest in this country do so if Ireland had voted "No" to the treaty?  I think they would think twice about it.  We must bear that in mind.  People will oppose the treaty for various reasons but I suggest they bear that question in mind.A potential investor will also look at our taxation and employment legislation and at that range of issues.  All of these issues will be considered.  We must ensure that balance.  I am afraid the Bill will tip the balance in the wrong direction.I regret I missed the speeches from the upper corner of the Chamber this evening.  I wanted to hear them.  However, I read Deputy Tóibín's speech of last night.  He referred to our neighbouring country and the regulations in the United Kingdom, but he misrepresented the facts.  In the United Kingdom, 60 days notice of redundancy is required, but that country is already considering reducing that to 30 days.  If we are to mention what other countries do, we should get our facts right.  The United Kingdom is on the way back to where we are because they recognise we have got things right.Other parts of the Bill propose speeding up the service to people who are made redundant and ensuring they receive their entitlements more promptly.  I agree we need to improve on that.  Changes have been made to that service but more needs to be done.  People are still having to wait months, which is far too long.I repeat what I said when in opposition: we need to provide for companies in a way which foresees the possibility of going out of business or laying off staff and to flag that possibility at an earlier stage, perhaps behind closed doors, to the various agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland or Departments.  I encourage such companies to seek help at an earlier stage.  We might consider legislation to allow for that, but increasing the number of days to debate redundancy will not achieve anything.  If it did, I would support it but I am not convinced of its benefits and I do not understand what it would achieve.  I am in favour of earlier notification to those who might be able to step in and help, if we can do that.I understand there is a grey area where a company is technically insolvent but the workers are not being made redundant and where the company can be forced to become insolvent so the workers will be entitled to receive redundancy benefits.  If we move too fast to wind up a company, we eliminate the chance to bring it back from the brink.  Deputy Tóibín, who made this proposal, has worked with many companies in the past.  Like other Members who have worked with various companies, Deputy Tóibín must know that a company can be saved at the last minute and come back from the brink.  If we move too early, we eliminate the chance of that happening and of saving the company.  We then have to re-start the company and move the jobs over so that things become very complicated.I understand the logic of what the Bill is trying to achieve.  Members on all sides agree that no harm is meant by the Bill, but we must get the balance right.  There are elements of the Bill that can be worked on.  Sinn Féin speakers have asked the Minister to look at the issues raised in the Bill and to work on them.  Improvements are called for in this area.  We can work on those.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I acknowledge Sinn Féin's bringing the Bill to the House.  I did not hear the contribution of Deputy Tóibín, but I read it and looked at the points he made.  Deputy Ann Phelan made an important point, which is that no public representative has a monopoly of wisdom or understanding of the rights of workers and how they need to be protected.  We all have family members who have been affected by unemployment and we deal with it, and the difficulties and stress that go with it, in our work as public representatives as people come into our constituency offices and clinics.  I welcome any Bill, or any piece of thinking, that seeks to make redundancy fairer to employees, while recognising the difficulties and rights of employers.This is a discussion we need to have.  Like Deputy English, when I was reading Deputy Tóibín's speech, it appeared to me he was acknowledging some difficulties in the Bill but that he wanted the debate to begin and certain issues to be raised.  The Government is working on a number of areas of reform, to which my colleagues have referred, and we hope they will deal with some of the points raised.In my experience, two issues are frequently raised by constituents.  The first is the lack of information in the period when it looks as if a company will be wound down and employees made redundant.  Employees are often not clear on their rights and entitlements or about the roles of the various bodies, how they will be brought into the workplace and how they will engage.  At a time when stress levels are already high, this uncertainty makes things more difficult for employees and makes planning for the future all the more difficult.  The second issue relates to one touched on by Deputy Clare Daly.  Employees are often not clear about the role of administrators in this period, how they are meant to engage with employees and how employees should deal with administrators and respond to points they make.Another issue causes difficulty for people who are about to be made unemployed, although it is outside the scope of the Bill.  People who have been working in certain types of companies or for themselves often find, when they lose their jobs, that they are entitled to no benefit at all.  This may be because they were self-employed or because their work was short-term, consisting of several different contracts going back over a long period.  The shock of this discovery for people who have been working all their lives in a particular part of the economy is something that must be dealt with.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has touched on this.  My colleagues have highlighted the reasons the Government will not accept the Bill, relating to amendments to sections 1 and 6.I will conclude with some thoughts on how we can move this issue forward and what the future will be.The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has outlined a process of moving to a two-tier structure where we will amalgamate a lot of the bodies that are there at the moment and bring them together in the hope of making the system clearer.  He has already introduced some changes.  I heard Deputy Ann Phelan speak about a single application form and a single contact portal.  However, the most important thing on which we must focus is the administration of the work to ensure that it happens in line with people's expectations; that when they contact this new structure that they receive a response within a reasonable period and that at all times they are clear about where they stand within the process.  We can create new structure after new structure but a quantity of work remains to be done to support the system and ensure it operates in a timely and transparent fashion.  That would make a huge difference.

There was a touch of history in that he made reference to the fact that the amendments to the legislation were being moved on May Day, or as some of us call it International Labour Day.  The touch of history to which I referred relates to the fact that we do not traditionally connect Sinn Féin with May Day.  We do connect Sinn Féin with Easter Sunday for obvious reasons because we are dealing with two different traditions.  The reference to May Day brought back a memory to me and reminded me also that we are one year away from the celebration of the centenary of the Dublin Lock-Out.  My grandfather used to say to us that he could never vote for Sinn Féin because Sinn Féin and Arthur Griffith refused to publicly support the Dublin Lock-Out.  He never forgave them for that, as was the case with many others.  In his very good biography, Seán O'Casey makes reference to how Mr. Larkin and Mr. Connolly felt about it.  I do not say it is a bad thing; in fact it is a positive thing that people move towards recognising the working class and its struggle.I will quickly move on as I am sharing my time with this good Cork man - Deputy Ciarán Lynch.  I have grave reservations about the proposed amendment to section 9 of the 1977 Act.  Other points have been made about the other amendments.  Employers are well able to look after themselves.  However, a mistake has been made in section 9; I do not suggest by any means that it was deliberate.  I am someone who was made redundant in recent years.  This is my first job since being made redundant.  I am beginning to wish that I had not been made redundant but nevertheless, let us move on.  When one gets over the initial effect of being made redundant, especially if one has a family and a mortgage, the first thing on which one zones in is on getting an alternative job.  That is where the mistake is made in section 9 of the amended Bill, which could have catastrophic effects.I recall strike committees in the 1980s when a company was being closed.  If one extends the period to 90 days it could put the situation in complete disarray if one has workers in a factory who are involved in a trade union looking for jobs.  In fairness to Deputy English, he stole my thunder.  The TUC in Britain is moving towards our model based on the 1977 legislation.  I accept there are differences among the unions in this country on the issue.  We should reserve ourselves in regard to section 9.  There is no point in me talking about the other sections because they were adequately covered by other speakers.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I thank my colleague, Deputy Maloney, for granting me this time.  As we speak, word is travelling outside this House that the Vita Cortex dispute which has lasted for 139 days is now coming to an end and that an agreement has been reached between the employer and the workers in that factory.  A total of 32 workers have given 847 years service between them.  An agreement has been reached which will be welcomed by this House and throughout the land.  The Vita Cortex workers, through their campaign over 139 days captured the public imagination in this country and in doing so acted as an inspiration to a host of others.  I congratulate them and commend them on what I hope will be a successful conclusion to a struggle that has gone on for months over the winter, including over the Christmas period.  When many of us were eating our Christmas dinner those people were still sitting in a cold, icy factory.  It is great to see that their perseverance has won out and that the fairness, respect and justice they sought now looks as if it will be handed to them.Ann Egar, the SIPTU representative of the workers, said it had been an honour to represent them in the struggle.  On behalf of this House I congratulate her, the workers and everyone else associated with the campaign.  In the aftermath of this case questions must be asked by this House about how employers plead inability to pay and how the dispute unfolded and became such a fractious issue.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As an employer of 18 years I consider this to be an important topic.  At a time of high unemployment, security of employment is all the more important.  An economic crisis should not deter us from striving to ensure that employees are treated fairly and equitably.  It is in how we handle issues such as employee rights at these times that we will be judged.  However, the principle must always be approached in a measured and balanced way.  I will not be supporting the Bill because while I agree with and admire the spirit of the Bill, the way it is presented will not resolve the difficulties with which it proposes to deal.First, the Bill proposes extending the information and consultation period prior to redundancy from 30 days to 90 days.  The reality is that the proposal would have little impact in the case of a number of high profile company wind-ups that have brought the Bill before us today.  The 30 day period is sufficient and has always been sufficient.  There has never been an application by either an employee's group or an employer's group to revise it upwards.  In these high profile business failures it was not the case that there was a failure to meet the 30 day deadline.  There was no consultation or information period whatsoever.  We have a better chance of co-operation and adherence where the mandatory period of time is practicable and manageable.  Irrespective of the length of the period set out, sadly, there will be situations where companies will not comply and there are procedures in law to deal with those circumstances.  This is not the right answer to the problem.Other speakers have referred to the 2012 sample of redundancy notifications that have shown that 65% of notifications gave six weeks notice and 50% allowed two months or more where companies are compliant.  The mandatory period is perfectly sufficient and extending it would do nothing to address the cases of non-compliance.  What it might do however, is act as a chill factor, repelling prospective inward investment which is the last thing we need to do at present.On the resolution of disputes and the handling of complaints, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has made impressive progress already and continues to cut through the red tape in regard to employment rights and industrial relations.  All first incident complaints are now acknowledged and the employer is notified within five days - a process that in some cases is taking up to eight months.  A single complaint form has now replaced 30 existing complaint forms that currently accommodate more than 100 complaint types across five institutions.  Where it was taking an average of 142 days to schedule rights commissioner hearings in 2010, these are now arranged within a matter of weeks.  A single contact portal and accompanying website, workplacerelations.ie, has successfully brought all the relevant information together in one place, which is of benefit to both employers and employees.The delivery of an early resolution process has also commenced, assisting parties involved in a dispute to resolve the issue themselves with the assistance of a case resolution officer.  Crucially, if the process fails, those involved will not lose their so-called place in the queue.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has constantly stated his commitment to delivering a world class workplace relations service.  Impressive progress has been made in that regard to date.  He is also establishing a two-tier workplace resolution structure which means that two statutorily independent bodies will replace the existing five by the end of this year.  We need to realise that job creation is the most important aspect of what we do.  The Action Plan for Jobs is a seminal document.  We need to start looking positively at the issue of job creation.Sinn Féin should look at its position on the treaty.  I run a business and if the treaty does not go through, I fear it will cause me, not to mention my employees, many problems.  The uncertainty it will create will be frightening.  I am not sure why Sinn Féin is insisting that it will have no impact on the jobs position.I admire the spirit of the Bill.  It is always good to speak about employees' rights and the issue of employment.  However, in the way it is phrased, the Bill needs more work.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I wish to share time with Deputies Michael Colreavy, Mary Lout McDonald, Johnathan O'Brien, Pádraig Mac Lochlainn and Pearse Doherty.I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  This is timely legislation and as many of my party colleagues have mentioned, the purpose of the Bill is to enhance the period of notice given to workers being made redundant collectively and expedite the hearing and processing of claims to entitlements.  It also seeks to allow workers who have been made redundant by a company which is, in effect, insolvent but which has not had a liquidator appointed to claim their entitlements from the insolvency fund.  The real effect of the Bill, though, is to provide for some additional supports and relief for people at what is almost always a trying and vulnerable time.  We should not forget that behind every announcement of the latest employment statistics and job losses, of which we have heard far too many in the last few years, there are the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people.  Theirs is the real story and we have become all too familiar with employers taking callous advantage of them and, by extension, their families and communities.Far too often we have seen an approach to redundancy by employers which has been nothing short of incredible.  This does not apply to all employers; far from it.  We all acknowledge that in the normal course of events companies come into and go out of existence.  Some succeed and some fail and when they fail, workers are made redundant.  This is accepted.  It is also accepted that employers take risks and make considerable investments in getting businesses off the ground and sustaining them.  However, what is equally clear to at least some of us in the House is that employees, ordinary workers at every level, make a business.  Their efforts, hours worked and dedication are fundamental in ensuring viability.  In the cases of Waterford Crystal, TalkTalk, La Senza, Lagan Brick, Vita Cortex and the Game stores, for example, this recognition was obviously absent.  I have had cause in my constituency of Cork East to deal personally with ex-workers, their wives and families at a number of these sites.  It is their plight that the Bill seeks to address in part.  These are some of the notable examples.  There are, undoubtedly, many others that never make the six o'clock news, many other workers who receive notification of redundancy and are refused their agreed and reasonable entitlements.  If we keep going as we are, there is no doubt that we will see increasing numbers of such cases as unscrupulous employers seek to feather current and future ventures in what is an enabling environment.We have seen employers who will do everything in their power to avoid doing the right thing and to avoid their responsibilities.  The bottom line is money, personal profit and personal greed above all else.  Consideration for the effects of their actions is secondary - how they affect staff and, to a lesser extent, customers and suppliers.  It is no co-incidence that the commitment of a number of these employers to Ireland and its people can be questioned.  Anything goes in business and the bottom line mentioned is God.  These companies have shown themselves to be quite willing to abandon loyal and dedicated staff for the prospect of employing cheaper labour and making higher profits elsewhere - mar a dearfhá, is glas iad na cnoic i fhad uainn.  At a time when people are exposed and vulnerable, with the cuts and charges introduced by Fine Gael and the Labour Party making day-to-day living even more difficult, there is a sub-culture of exploitation.  These and other unscrupulous employers are, in a premeditated and planned way, taking steps to minimise their own personal losses at the expense of the very people who have worked hard to give them that status.The current economic climate should provide us with the opportunity to take stock of what is important to us.  I call on all Deputies to support the Bill.  Workers would benefit.  It would give them some extra security and protection at what is always a trying time.  Responsible employers would have nothing to fear and a number of unions have already indicated their support.  The House needs to show where its loyalty lies.  Is it with the needy or is it still, even with the Labour Party in government, very firmly with the greedy?
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Yesterday was May Day, a day on which workers throughout the world march, organise and remember their long tradition and the difficulties faced by them, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe and many other parts of the world.  There were thousands of people in cities throughout the world demanding better rights and opportunities for themselves and fellow workers.  It is apt that we are speaking about workers' rights and how we can play our part in improving the lives of ordinary people in this country.  When the financial crisis hit this country, it was low and middle income earners who were forced to bear the brunt of the mistakes made by bankers and developers.In the past year we have seen a number of examples of workers' struggle, including Vita Cortex, La Senza and Lagan Brick.  These were dedicated workers who are being cheated out of fair redundancy packages.  The Bill would not address all of the issues relating to workers' rights and redundancy entitlement, but it is a step in the right direction.  It aims to ensure workers would receive their redundancy entitlements in a reasonable timeframe.  After years of work, it is the least to which workers should be entitled.  The most recent figures indicate that there is a backlog of approximately 29,000 statutory redundancy claims in the pipeline, which is a disgrace.The Bill attempts to lengthen the notification period in collective redundancies from 30 days to 60 where companies have 20 to 99 employees and from 30 days to 90 where companies have 100 plus employees.  It seeks to ensure workers in companies which are insolvent in all but name would be entitled to apply for payment from the insolvency fund after their company had ceased trading for over 60 days.  It would put in place a maximum period of 60 days after a determination of the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal in which to have their entitlements paid to them from the insolvency fund.  Where a decision is not made within 60 days, the Minister would be required to issue a statement on the matter within 30 days and publish further updates at intervals of every 30 days until the matter was determined.The Bill is only a small part of what is needed to improve the conditions of workers.  Parties should set aside partisan politics and work together to introduce this legislation and more like it to ensure workers would have better conditions.  Further ideas could be explored in the way we make redundancy payments.  In many European countries such as Germany workers receive on a weekly basis a payment approximating to their wages for a fixed period, complemented by training provided by the State.  This approach would provide an incentive for workers made redundant to up-skill and retrain and ultimately make the task of getting back into the workforce easier.Today I met workers from Irish Cement-CRH who are being deprived of their legal rights by their employers.  At the meeting there were Fine Gael, Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Independent Deputies present - there was also a Minister present - all of whom undertook to support the workers in every way possible.  This is their opportunity.  They should vote for the Bill.  If it is not perfect, they should seek to amend it as it passes through the Houses, but they should deliver on the promise they made to the workers.  They should do something to improve their rights.  Supporting the Bill is the right thing to do.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  When asked yesterday if his Government would support this Bill ,the Taoiseach said "No", which hardly comes as a surprise.  After all, protecting the most fundamental rights and expectations of workers has never been high on the agenda of the Fine Gael Party.  It was left to the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, to defend the position of the Government last night.  Once again, it seems Fine Gael is setting the agenda while its Labour Party partners in government are relegated to the role of stepping in to back up the larger party.  For reasons best known to himself, the Minister of State's point of reference in evaluating the merits of the Bill was the British Conservative Party.  Sinn Féin's proposal seeks to extend the current notification period in respect of collective redundancies to bring it into line with provisions in the North.  The Minister of State said last night that Britain is actively evaluating the relevance of the continued application of the 90 day provision.  It can be no surprise to any of us that a Tory-led Government would seek to dismantle hard-won workers' rights.I can only rationalise that it was in an effort to copperfasten his party's jump to the right that the Minister of State went on the say that the 30 day provision has served the State well and that neither employers nor employees have ever sought amendments to current legislation.  I can only suggest that he take himself out of the confines of his cosy office in Leinster House once in a while and rub shoulders with the former workers of Waterford Crystal, TalkTalk, La Senza, Lagan Brick, Vita Cortex, Game and Wilson Publishing.  If he cannot rise to that, he should at least have a word with his party colleagues in the Seanad.  Only last September Labour Party Members in the Upper House brought forward a Private Members' Bill calling on the Government to act on the period of notification.  Senator Ivana Bacik called for greater protections to be put in place to assist employees who face collective redundancy situations.  She went on to propose that existing legislation be reviewed to provide for a longer notice period than 30 days.  Her party colleague, Senator Marie Moloney, a former SIPTU official, observed that she had met many people who had encountered difficulties in claiming their redundancy payments and entitlements.  She was of the view that a notice period of at least 60 days would allow people time to come to terms with the devastating news of the loss of their job and to investigate their entitlements.  Like Senator Bacik, she called on the Government to consider introducing legislation to that end.Several trade unions, including Mandate, have indicated their support for my party's Bill.  Many employees, including those in TalkTalk, have called for an extension of the notification period, as provided for in the Bill.  While the Labour Party Senators' Bill was limited to issues regarding redundancy rights and access to payments, at least they, unlike others of their Government colleagues, stepped up in response to the TalkTalk dispute.  This Administration has done nothing to address the scandalous position in which too many workers have been left following collective redundancies.  Instead of action, we have the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, sauntering into the Chamber, referring to the British Tories and telling us everything is A-okay.  I challenge any Labour Party Minister to relay that message to workers who have experienced collective redundancy and, months and years later, are still awaiting their entitlements.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Peadar Tóibín, on introducing this legislation and call on Members across the floor to support it.  In particular, I appeal to Labour Party Deputies to do the right thing.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I will begin by commenting on the breaking news in respect of the dispute at Vita Cortex, a dispute which should never have been allowed to happen in the first place.  This Government and previous Governments, through their failure to legislate for the protection of workers, forced a situation where workers had no choice but to occupy a factory for 139 days to secure the ex gratia payment they were promised.  This situation clearly shows the current legislation is inadequate, leaving workers, including those with decades of experience and loyalty to the same company, to fend for themselves and the political establishment unable to intervene to resolve the situation.  Even those politicians who wished to assist could not do anything other than offer words of encouragement and moral support.  This victory is a victory for the workers and nobody else, nor should anybody else seek to claim it.  There is an onus on the Government to ensure it never happens again.  The bottom line is that unless adequate legislation is introduced, that cannot be guaranteed.I listened with interest to the debate last night and in particular to the contributions of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, and his Labour Party colleagues.  What struck me was the inconsistency in that party's approach to this issue and its response to the Sinn Féin Bill.  The Minister of State put forward the view that the 60 and 90 day periods proposed in the Bill would be "unrealistic" and "inconsistent with the flexibility needed by companies to make decisions on restructuring and change".  Only last September, however, as Deputy Mary Lou McDonald observed, a Labour Party Private Members' Bill, which followed the announcement of job losses at TalkTalk, sought to address this very issue.  Several Labour Party Members made contributions in the course of that debate which were in direct contradiction with the statements made in this House last night by the Minister of State and other members of his party.  For example, the leader of the party in the Seanad, Senator Ivana Bacik, stated:First, we propose that greater protections be put in place by this Government to assist employees in any company, including TalkTalk, who face collective redundancy situations.  In particular ... we propose that existing legislation be reviewed in order to provide for a longer notice period than 30 days, especially in cases where a large company is proposing to make collective redundancies.  We are conscious that an extension of the 30-day period could be made within the terms of the EU directive.Senator Marie Moloney, a former SIPTU official, observed that many people have encountered difficulties when they tried to claim redundancy payments and entitlements and went on to indicate her support for a 60 day notice period.For too long the Labour Party has thrown the accusation at Sinn Féin that there are inconsistencies in our position on certain issues in this jurisdiction in comparison with our position on the same issues in the North.  That is to ignore the fiscal realities of partition.  Moreover, it is ironic that the Labour Party should see fit to preach to my party when it is unable to agree a position between its members who sit in two Chambers a few hundred feet apart from each other.  We are not suggesting that what we propose is perfect and will resolve everything, but it is a beginning.  If the Government is not willing to accept it, the challenge is for it to bring forward legislation that will adequately protect workers.  It is not good enough simply to vote down our proposal and then sit on one's hands, issuing platitudes to workers who are involved in sit-ins and are fighting for their entitlements.  It takes more than that to protect workers' rights.  It takes legislation and if the Government is not happy with this Bill, it should bring forward its own Bill and we can debate that.  Regardless of who brings in the legislation, the priority is to ensure workers are protected.

I sit here as a humble TD, listening to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers asking for constructive proposals from the Opposition.  We have had a string of companies leaving workers high and dry, pursuing cases and often having to occupy the premises where they worked to secure justice.  Here we have constructive proposals; we do not claim they are perfect or all encompassing but they are a contribution.  I have looked through them and for the life of me I cannot see why there is any difficulty here.  A 60 day period in which the Employment Appeals Tribunal or Labour Court must decide or be accountable to the Minister; a review period every 30 days; a 60 day period after determination is made during which payment should be forthcoming to workers and, finally, lengthening the period of redundancy notification to reflect the size of the company.  Those are sensible and reasonable suggestions but they will be voted down.  Is it any wonder the public regard this place as a farce?  Every time the Opposition tries to provide some solutions, it gets swatted down.The most topical issue recently was the Private Members' motion that Sinn Féin tabled that asked the Government not to introduce the legislation for the European Stability Mechanism before the House until after the referendum.  That motion was voted down but now the Government has done exactly as we asked.  At times I scratch my head.I wish to talk about why my colleague, Deputy Tóibín, has brought this Bill before the House.  I am a Buncrana man from Donegal and in my small community there are two clear examples of why this is necessary.Clubman Omega was an Irish-owned textile manufacturer, a shirt factory that employed dedicated workers, in some cases for decades.  They agreed to work fewer hours and take pay cuts.  They did everything they could to sustain that company; they could not have been more loyal.  Eventually they were let go with statutory redundancy.  Those women picketed Clubman Omega in a county that at the time was renowned not for radical politics or pickets but for its conservatism.  Those women ended up setting a record for a strike in Donegal.  In pouring rain, hail and snow they were outside the factory to protest.  It was inspirational but sadly in the end they did not get what they were entitled to.Recently, we saw the same story in Seatem-owned ticket company Keith Prowse, which was based on the outskirts of Buncrana and which closed, leaving more than 100 workers who had given loyal service without a job.  There were numerous companies - Seatem (UK), Seatem (Donegal) and Seatem (Ireland) - and they closed down operations in Buncrana, leaving people high and dry, most of them women.  They have now had to wait a year and a half just to get their statutory entitlements sorted out.  They were not even issued with P45s.  The company started to refuse to take phone calls after a couple of weeks.   I was Mayor of Buncrana when this happened and I contacted the Minister about this.  We pulled all of the agencies together and in fairness some of those agencies performed well but the Government and the system failed those workers badly.  Some of them have still not received their entitlements.That is the human reality in a small town like Buncrana and it is replicated throughout the State.  I appeal to the Government to restore some faith among the public.  When it gets constructive, solution-oriented proposals, it could respond positively, do the right thing and back this Bill.We had a Labour Party TD bizarrely talking about the 1913 Lock Out and how Arthur Griffith of Sinn Féin did not stand by the workers.  That is why his grandfather said he should never vote for Sinn Féin.  God almighty, they talk about Civil War politics.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	390	Every week in Donegal, and here in my office in Leinster House, I receive representations from people who have lost their jobs.  The calls do not only come from my constituency but from all over the State.  While each call is different, and each person's circumstances unique, there is a common thread binding them all.  Not only must people cope with the loss of their livelihood and income, not only must they face an uncertain future looking for work and trying to make ends meet, amidst all of that uncertainty, they must also fight to receive their basic redundancy entitlements.I have dealt with workers who after ten years employment arrived to work on a Monday morning to be told they no longer had a job.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn and others have talked about the individual stories.  I can remember getting the call from a factory beside my home town and walking up to the factory to see the workers lying on the ground crying, grown men and women, because of how the company treated them, telling them they had to leave the premises immediately.  The fight for their basic redundancy entitlements went on for weeks afterwards.In other cases people are being refused adequate redundancy payments by companies that continue to trade and generate a profit.  We all remember the young women workers in La Senza who were treated in the most appalling way by their employer.  The same happened to the workers in GAME.  In both cases workers were not given adequate notice of their redundancy, were not provided with appropriate redundancy packages and were then faced with the prospect of applying for statutory redundancy with all the stress and waiting that that involves.As my colleagues have outlined last night and tonight, even when employers stick to the rules there are clear problems with the system.  Minimum time limits are not sufficient, recognition of orders representatives are hit and miss and workers do not have access to apply to the insolvency fund.  These are just some of the limitations of the current system.  Every week we hear of companies closing or workers being laid off without adequate recognition of their statutory rights.  Every week we are contacted by newly unemployed people telling us that the current statutory regime is letting them down.The Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill provides a number of sensible and practical improvements to the existing regime.  It will not stop people from losing their jobs but the measures contained in the Bill will make a real, practical difference to people struggling to cope with the reality of unemployment.It was fitting that this Bill was introduced yesterday on 1 May, International Workers' Day.  It is a day when we remember the century long struggle for the protection of workers' rights and entitlements.  We remember the many struggles for decent pay and conditions; for trade union recognition and for an economy that respects workers for the contribution they make to society.  It would be fitting for all TDs who believe in the protection of workers' rights to send a very clear signal from this Chamber tonight.  Let us leave aside our party political differences and our ideological disagreements and unanimously support this Bill.  In doing so we would be sending out a powerful signal that this Oireachtas unanimously supports workers' rights.  These rights are being actively undermined and workers - whether it is those at Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick, Vodafone, La Senza or GAME- are standing up in defence of them.  Let us show the workers to whom I refer and others who may find themselves in the same situation in the future that we are not just about rhetorical support.  Let it not be the case that the Department merely issues a statement to the effect that it will do everything in its power and that the services of FÁS will be available to workers who have been laid off.  We must show these people, through our actions as legislators, that we are ensuring they will have the maximum protection possible under law.It is disappointing that the Government has decided to vote against the legislation.  That is an appalling message to send to the workers who are currently in the position to which I refer or those who may find themselves in such a position in the future.  God knows there are enough of these people about the place at present.  I appeal to the Government to do the right thing and support the Bill.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	391	At the outset, I welcome the very good news that the Vita Cortex workers have voted to accept a proposal in respect of outstanding redundancy payments.I listened with interest to the debate on the Bill.  In the current economic environment, the plight of employees is a matter of major significance for the Government.  We remain committed to ensuring that protections for workers are both relevant and capable of being vindicated.  This is the focus of the Government's approach.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, indicated, Sinn Féin's Bill, while well intended, would offer no practical improvements to the plight of workers.  Instead, it would impose an unreasonable and unnecessary constraint on employers and employees and would serve only to shackle our efforts to respond to the increasingly sophisticated demands of industry and labour market requirements.The provisions contained in the Bill would be of no relevance in the context of the most of the recent high-profile cases to which Sinn Féin and other Members.  As the Taoiseach has stated, at the heart of the many of these disputes is the absence of dignity toward workers.  Regrettably, it is not possible to legislate for a requirement that employers should behave decently and fairly in respect of the way they treat their employees.I wish to address some of the issues that have arisen in the course of the debate.  The workplace relations reform project, which has been referred to on several occasions, is one of the most significant initiatives undertaken by my Department in recent years.  It represents a major transformation of the means through which employment rights are communicated, enforced and, ultimately, vindicated.  As well as providing for the amalgamation of the five existing employment rights bodies into an integrated and simplified two-tier structure, the reform project will amend existing redress procedures to ensure the more timely hearing of cases and the clear communication of decisions.  This project will result in a better service for employers and employees at a significantly lower cost to the Exchequer.  The bodies involved in the process are the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, the Labour Court and the Equality Tribunal.  It is reasonable that a project of such significance will take some time to complete.  Notwithstanding this consideration, however, I am pleased to note that the project has already achieved some significant administrative improvements that provide real benefits to users.I am pleased to report that the significant legislative programme required to deliver the structures and processes relating to the implementation of workplace relations reform is at an advanced stage of development.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, who unfortunately cannot be present because he is on a trade mission to America, hopes to seek a Government decision for the priority drafting of the workplace relations Bill for enactment this autumn.The number of cases that have arisen in recent times in respect of companies which are becoming insolvent and which are not engaging in timely and adequate dialogue with their employees is regrettable.  I appreciate that businesses are under considerable pressure but this should not be used as an excuse for treating employees in a shabby manner.  The Government has an expectation that all employers should act in good faith and should treat their employees with the dignity and respect they deserve.In the context of the European Commission's audit of directives relating to collective redundancies, the transfer of undertakings, the protection of employees and information and consultation - to which reference was made earlier in the debate - the position is that work in this regard is at an early stage.  The first meeting of national experts from member states will take place during the summer and my Department is ready to actively engage in the process as required.The issue of backlogs was also raised.  The current position with regard to the workplace relations bodies is as follows: NERA has no inspection backlog; the Rights Commissioner Service has no backlog in respect of hearings; the Labour Court is working on the basis of a reduced backlog of three months; and the average waiting time for claims to the EAT to be heard is 76 weeks in Dublin and 80 weeks elsewhere.  The EAT has been proactive in dealing with the volume of cases presented.  It increased the number of cases finalised in 2011 by 11% above the number for 2010.  The latter was itself an increase of 29% on the figure for 2009.  The number of claims disposed of to end March 2012 continued to show an increase.  While various short-term steps have been taken to address these issues, a more comprehensive solution will be addressed in the context of the workplace relations reform project.In respect of redundancy payments administered by the Department of Social Protection, I can confirm that the current backlog is 16,000 and not, as some Members indicated, 29,000.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I accept that this figure is still high and we are working to reduce it.  A new computerised system has been introduced and this is allowing for the speedier processing of claims.  A number of Deputies referred to the issue of ex gratia payments made in redundancy situations.  The purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  It is the responsibility of employers to pay statutory redundancy to all eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to his or her employees is entitled to a rebate from the State of a percentage of the relevant amount.  While an employer is, of course, free to make payments to employees in excess of the statutory entitlement, the Department’s role relates exclusively to the payment of the statutory entitlement.The workplace relations reform project is a tangible example of the Government's commitment not just to the legislative scope employment rights but, just as importantly, to the means through which these rights can be upheld and vindicated.  Sinn Féin's Bill proposes amendments which, as well as representing an additional burden, offer no real improvements for employees relative to the existing suite of employment law protections.  Legislative provisions are only as good as the capacity that exists to enforce them.  As recent experience has shown, the focus should be on providing improved mechanisms through which vindication of existing rights can be facilitated.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already shown his clear commitment to this objective.I am of the view that the current legislative measures which the Bill proposes to change provide an adequate level of support for employees who find themselves in a situation where their employers have become insolvent.  As a result, I cannot support the Bill.

There are employers who will not waste a recession and who are using the current situation to drive down wages and to mistreat their workers.  Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick and Wilson Publishing abandoned agreed redundancy arrangements.  How is that adequate protection?  I applaud the workers at Vita Cortex.  It took them only 139 days of occupation to obtain whatever settlement it is they have achieved.  I commend them on their efforts.  Where was the adequate protection for those to whom I refer?  The Vita Cortex workers should not have been obliged to occupy the company's premises.  There has been a complete failure on the part of the Government in respect of this matter.  The workers at Lagan Brick have been on strike since 15 December.  These people were given one hour's notice of the closure of their place of employment.  Where was the adequate protection for them?  Wilson Publishing completely ignored the Labour Court's recommendations in respect of redundancy payments.  Where was the adequate protection in this regard?  I have met with most of these workers who have given 30 to 40 years of service to companies and have now been forced into industrial action.  This Bill was brought forward in a constructive and positive way.  We wanted to work with the Government to close loopholes which allow unscrupulous employers to ride roughshod over the rights of workers.I asked the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to intervene in my constituency on behalf of workers in Diageo and other companies but he refused to intervene.  Irish Cement workers there are having their rights trampled upon.  Vodafone last year outsourced 130 jobs to India and Egypt.  When I asked the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to intervene, they failed to do so.  In recent weeks, Vodafone announced plans to move over 300 jobs from Vodafone call centres in Dublin and Dundalk to Newry.  No allowances are available for employees who simply cannot move with their job to Newry.  Accordingly, they will not be entitled to any redundancy payments despite years of service with the company.  Where is the adequate protection about which the Minister of State spoke?  Vodafone is the leading supplier of mobile telephone and data services to Departments, receiving its own adequate protection of over €7.25 million in charges over the past five years, almost €1.5 million per year.  These contracts should include clauses for conditions on jobs retention.  Vodafone also used to be Eircell, a highly profitable State company.This morning, I, along with other Oireachtas Members, met with workers from Irish Cement.  The company has completely ignored a Labour Court recommendation that it must pay between €5,500 and €9,500 in sums owed to workers.  Irish Cement is part of the CRH group, one of the world's largest building materials companies.  Its chief executive, Myles Lee, received a cash bonus last year of over €500,000 which made his remuneration total €2.6 million in 2011.I want to give way to my esteemed colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, who gets tetchy when I run into his time.  However, I must say it is disgraceful that the Minister of State claimed there is adequate protection for workers.  There is not.  All the main parties, including Fine Gael and the Labour Party, were represented at today's meeting and all Members present expressed support for the Irish Cement workers.  If they were serious, then they would be supporting this Bill tonight.  Incidentally, I asked the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to intervene in that dispute as well but he failed to do so.

Is fiú ligint don Bhille seo dul ar aghaidh agus iarraim ar gach Teachta, Teachtaí an Rialtais san aireamh, tacú leis.  Má tá gá le leasuithe, lig don Bille dul ar aghaidh chuig Céim an Choiste.In summing up on behalf of Sinn Féin, I want to thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate last evening and tonight.  This Bill seeks to address a pressing need arising from the recession and the jobs famine that we have experienced since 2008.  When there was almost full employment, this problem of redundancy conditions was present but far less obvious than it is now.  A succession of cases in recent times has seen workers placed in bad situations and, as legislators, it is our duty to address this pressing problem.It is most regrettable the Government has decided to oppose the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage.  The Bill is not a complete answer, nor do we claim it to be, to a complex problem but it does provide part of the answer.

Higgins, when he invoked the history of the Labour Party and the 1913 Dublin lock-out.  What a pity, then, that the Minister of State went on in the very next passage of his speech to say:Ultimately, it could serve only to expose the taxpayer and employers to additional burdens while also, ironically, acting as a chill factor to the creation of vitally necessary new employment in the State.Where have we heard the phrases "a burden to taxpayers and employers" and "a chill factor to new employment" before?  All of this was said on the minimum wage and before that to a host of measures introduced over decades to protect the rights, the pay and the conditions of workers.In December 2010, the Labour Party put forward a Private Members' motion to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage introduced by the then Fianna Fáil-led Government.

In my constituency, we saw the plight of the GAME workers who, in common with their fellow workers in stores across the country, staged a sit-in at the Monaghan town shop.  These young workers were simply dumped without notice by their employer while the State was left to pick up the tab in statutory redundancy payments.Since 15 December, the workers at Lagan Brick in Kingscourt, County Cavan, have been maintaining a 24-hour vigil at the plant after they were laid off at an hour's notice.  Once again, workers were dumped by their employer and nothing worthwhile was on offer, despite many years of service by the staff, 43 years in the case of one worker.We are talking here about ordinary working people and their families.  These and many thousands of workers like them are dependent on employers for work and on the Government to ensure fairness at work, as well as fairness in the event of redundancy.  They have been let down badly on both counts.  They do not have gilt-edged private pensions, senior Civil Service pensions or offshore bank accounts on which to fall back.  This Bill's primary purpose is to enhance the period of notice to workers being made redundant and to speed up the hearing and processing of claims to entitlements.The Government itself is giving bad example in this regard.  Yesterday, I received a reply from the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, concerning redundancy payments to special needs assistants who were laid off by the Government last autumn.  Redundancy applications received by the Department in October 2011 are only now being processed.  That is not good enough, especially when it affects low-paid workers.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, stated the British Government is actively evaluating the relevance of the continued application of the 90 day provision in its jurisdiction.  He said the existing 30 day notification and consultation period have served this State well for more than 30 years and neither employer nor employee have ever sought their amendment.  He claimed that the 60 and 90 day periods would be unrealistic and inconsistent with the flexibility needed by companies in making decisions in restructuring.  He also stated it could create a period of prolonged uncertainty for workers.  I find this incredible.  Are the intentions of a British Tory Government being advanced by a Labour Minister as an argument against this Bill?In essence, that is what has been happening.  It is simply untrue on the part of the Government to state that employees have not sought a change in the 30 day notification and consultation period.  The record shows the contrary is true.This Bill has received the support of the Mandate and Unite trade unions.  Mandate's general secretary, Mr. John Douglas, has stated that the Bill is:very much welcomed by Mandate, as recently unemployed workers are finding it harder and harder to get the benefits that they are entitled to.  The Government needs to protect workers and this Bill is a step in the right direction.Unite has also given full support to this legislation and its national co-ordinator, Mr. Walter Cullen, has pointed out that his union is currently involved in more than 200 individual cases that have been awaiting adjudication for more than two years.  It represents former staff at the Connaught Telegraph newspaper, who have been deprived of wages and holiday pay totalling €20,000 for the past six months.  He stated:It is too easy for bodies and companies to rush consultation and delay payments.  Individuals will gain much better protection in the fairer framework this legislation will give rise to.  We fully support its introduction with all possible haste.That is a strong endorsement for this Bill, and we in Sinn Féin are very proud of that.Despite what some Deputies have inferred, there is no question of this legislation putting companies out of business.  Some may have misunderstood the provisions.  The Bill would deem companies insolvent for the purposes of the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act only.  This relates exclusively to allowing workers access to the insolvency fund and does not affect the company otherwise in terms of its legal status.  The protections which exist clearly are not adequate.  Employees have been left in a legal limbo and unable to access their entitlements, which is a scandalous loophole.  We are endeavouring to deal with that in this Bill.It is a pity the Government did not take more notice of the Labour Party Senators, to whom my colleague, Deputy O'Brien referred.  More than six months ago, in the context of the TalkTalk dispute, they called on the Government to act.  Senator Marie Maloney, a former SIPTU official, has already been cited, and she stated:I am aware of many people who have encountered difficulties when they tried to claim redundancy payments and entitlements ... I am aware of individuals who have been waiting as long as three years for payments.  This is not good enough ... If employees have at least 60 days' notice, they will have time to come to terms with the devastating news and investigate their entitlements.Senator Denis Landy stated:I cannot and do not accept the argument that if a new company is being brought in and faces a requirement to give 60 days notice then, even if everything else fits into place, the company will choose not to come here as a result of that provision. That does not stand up.Senator Ivana Bacik stated "We propose that existing legislation be reviewed in order to provide for a longer notice period than 30 days, especially in cases where a large company is proposing to make collective redundancies."  The Government should listen to the voices in their respective teams.

As a result, Irish free-to-air channels will be available in 100% of the country for the first time.The carriage of TG4, TV3 or any other broadcaster on the SAORSAT service is a commercial decision for each of the broadcasters in question and the terms and conditions relating to such carriage would be a matter for commercial negotiation between RTÉ and the relevant broadcaster.  I have been informed that TG4 plans to be available on SAORSAT and it is expected that this will happen shortly.  It is my understanding that TV3 has not yet made a decision as to its carriage on the service.

In procuring these specialised services, my Department always seeks to ensure value for money and the keeping of expenditure to the minimum necessary.  In this regard, the Deputy might note that expenditure from my Department's consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews budget has reduced from €2.095m in 2007 to €1.364m in 2011.Given the technical complexity of the sectors which my Department oversees and, in some instances regulates, there is a requirement to procure specialised services to address specific issues as they arise. The Department therefore also necessarily incurs some expenditure on outsourced services as part of programme expenditure, an element of which is consultancy in nature. I will forward the figure for the consultancy element to the Deputy when it is disaggregated from the larger programme spend.

The Gate process was put in place by the CER following public consultation.  It is a group processing approach towards the processing and issuance of grid connection offers to renewable generators.  The CER issued its Gate 3 Direction to the system operators on 16/12/08 in Decision Paper CER 08/260 setting out the Criteria for Gate 3 renewable generation offers and related matters.  Several other related CER Decision papers have followed that relate to Gate 3 including CER 11/093 on the Connection Offer Policy and Process and CER 10/211 on Relocation of Generation Capacity.The Gate 3 Liaison Group established by CER comprises the system operators and industry representatives, including the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA) and Meitheal na Gaoithe. The liaison group is a forum for discussion and communication on Gate 3 matters.  The documents and minutes of the meetings are publicly available on the CER website www.cer.ie.ESB Networks and EirGrid, as system operators, are responsible for issuing the grid connection offers to the Gates.  They advise that it would be common practice that offers are amended, for instance, at the request of the developer for an alternative proposal or in cases where some of those in the group drop out and a decision is made by the system operator to build the connection in a different way.  The principle underlying the offer must however remain that the build is proposed in the least cost technically acceptable manner.  It is open to any developers with a grievance about a modification to the grid connection offer to raise the matter with the CER, which will make a ruling following consideration of the case.The right of EirGrid and ESB Networks to terminate a Connection Agreement on the passing of a Longstop Date without the attainment of the relevant project milestone, has been enshrined in the CER approved Connection Agreements for some time.  This relates to project developers that have accepted a grid connection offer and are required, for their part, to undertake certain works related to the project by a certain date (the longstop date).  CER has published the link to an Information Memorandum from the system operators on this subject to clarify future practice in relation to when this right to terminate a Connection Agreement will be enforced.  CER has received no submissions on the Information Memorandum, which serves to highlight the existing rules and had been signalled to the Gate 3 Liaison group in advance.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	444	Supervision of the grid connection process, including access to offers, is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The Gate process was put in place by the CER following public consultation.  It is a group processing approach (GPA) towards the processing and issuance of grid connection offers to renewable generators.  Under the GPA or Gate process, applications for connections are processed in batches rather than sequentially.  Within these gates, applications are further divided into groups and sub-groups based on the optimal network required to connect them.  This approach is considered by CER to be a more efficient process than dealing with applications on an individual basis.The group processing approach allows for a more strategic view to be taken of network requirements and serves to put in place efficient connection solutions to cater for a large number of applications and to ensure optimum network development, minimising network costs and, where possible, avoidance of network bottlenecks.  To date there have been 3 Gates.  Under Gate 1 and Gate 2, 1755MW of connection offers were made and accepted.  Under Gate 3, 3900MW of offers have issued to renewable generators.The take up of Gate 3 offers cannot be quantified as yet.  A small number of those in Gate 3 have accepted their offers to date and have already contracted with EirGrid or ESB Networks.  Others in Gate 3 have not yet made a decision on whether they are accepting their offer or not, pending the issuing of constraint reports by EirGrid.  EirGrid is currently working on producing these constraint reports and once issued those in Gate 3 applicants will have a short period of time within which to accept or reject their offer and to pay their deposit.  One of the causes of delay in EirGrid issuing constraint reports relates to the clarification of rules by the Single Electricity Market Committee as to the operation of the Single Electricity Market.  A decision in August 2011 set out principles of dispatch and the design of the market schedule in the Trading and Settlement Code while another in December 2011 set out the treatment of price-taking generation in tie breaks in the Single Electricity Market.  This latter decision has recently been re-opened for further consultation by the SEM Committee.A Gate 3 liaison group involving the TSO, DSO, regulator and industry representatives meets on a regular basis and all parties are committed to Gate 3.  The latest forecasts from SEAI as to the amount of renewable generation required to meet our 40% renewable electricity target is 4000MW, provided we achieve our energy efficiency goals.  Currently approximately 1900MW of renewable generation is connected to the grid including over 1600MW of wind generation.  A further 1500MW of renewable generation has contracted with either EirGrid or ESB Networks.  For the most part, these are projects from Gate 1 and Gate 2 that are still awaiting grid build-out, along with about 500MW from Gate 3.  It is expected that between what is already built in Gate 1 and Gate 2 and what has already contracted to build along with the remainder of Gate 3 is largely sufficient for the achievement of our 40% target, even if some Gate 3 developers ultimately decide not to accept their offer.Apart from the above, the Commission for Energy Regulation published a decision in 2009 (CER 09/099) that allows for certain renewable, small and low carbon generators to connect to the transmission and distribution grids without going through the full rigours of the Gate process.  This includes small projects, research and development projects and those that qualify as they are deemed to provide benefits of a public nature that merit qualification.It will be necessary to have accurate quantification of the take-up level of Gate 3 offers and the extent to which this enables achievement of the national renewable energy target, prior to taking further decisions on future Gates.  The need for significant grid build and grid upgrade to cater for the existing three Gates and to meet the 40% target and the operational issues associated with managing the grid with a high level of intermittent generation are complex and challenging matters.  EirGrid's DS3 programme is designed to ensure that the security and stability of the grid can be maintained while still achieving the required renewable penetration levels.

The meeting provided the opportunity for very useful and informative discussion in regard to the Commission's Report into the benefits of national gas infrastructure for the North West.  We also discussed the role of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the economic criteria governing the CER's gas networks Connection to Towns policy.The CER is the statutory, independent body, charged with the assessment and licensing of prospective operators seeking to develop and operate a gas distribution system within the State.  I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.  The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers.  Under the CER's policy framework, Bord Gáis Networks, and latterly Gaslink carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 3   report in 2010.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, ‘Why Invest in Gas’.  However, the Gaslink review found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.Gaslink will continue to regularly review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the 2010 Study as well as other towns.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.

It pre-dated the introduction of the REFIT scheme and is part of an earlier scheme to support renewable generation namely AER or Alternative Energy Requirement.  Under Orders brought in under the 1999 Electricity Regulation Act, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is responsible for calculation and certification of the Public Service Obligation (PSO).  The PSO year runs from 1 October each year until 30 September the following year.By 1 August each year, the CER publishes a Decision Paper on the PSO for the upcoming year, which sets out the components of the PSO and the amount to be charged to electricity consumers in the upcoming period.  The components are aggregated thus setting out the total costs associated with a given State Aid clearance decision.  While the CER would calculate the aggregate sum from individual projects, it does not publish a list of the amounts of the PSO that relate to individual projects, as the data are commercially sensitive.  In CER 11/130, the CER Decision on the 2011/2012 PSO year, the total cost of the AER scheme to the PSO is set out as €665,464.  The Decision states that there is 322MW of AER generation capacity supported in this PSO decision.  This would include the 25MW offshore windfarm referred to by the Deputy.A study undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and EirGrid entitled ‘Impact of Wind on Wholesale Electricity Costs in 2011', concludes that the reduction in the wholesale market cost of electricity as a result of wind in the market place in 2011 is approximately equivalent to the sum of PSO costs i.e. that there is no net additional cost to electricity consumers.  Benefits to Irish consumers from renewable energy include increased security of electricity supply, reduced reliance on high priced imported fossil fuels and reduced carbon emissions and economic activity and inward investment.Directive 2009/28/EC also places a legally binding obligation on Ireland to achieve a set proportion of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  In the event Ireland does not meet the target, the Directive requires the purchase of renewable credits (at an as yet unknown price) from other countries that will have exceeded their target.  By ensuring renewable energy development in line with the national target Ireland will avoid the risk of additional costs through having to purchase renewable credits, while enjoying the benefits in terms of reduced emissions, increased security of supply and increased economic activity.

The investigation of any individual case of theft, as a criminal offence, is a matter for An Garda Síochána and is not a matter in which I have any statutory role.  I am aware of reports of thefts from public lands and premises of metals for the scrap value of the stolen property.  I understand from my colleague Mr. Alan Shatter T.D., Minister for Justice and Equality that in the area of metal thefts, a number of initiatives have been developed by the Garda Síochána National Crime Prevention Unit.  A Metal Theft Forum under the Garda National Crime Prevention Unit has been established and has met with stakeholders particularly affected by this type of criminality including those in the communications, energy supply, transport, brewery and farming sectors to bring forward a metal theft crime prevention and reduction plan focusing on crime prevention and regulation of the scrap metal industry.

In procuring these specialised services, my Department always seeks to ensure value for money and the keeping of expenditure to the minimum necessary.  In this regard, the Deputy might note that expenditure from my Department's consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews budget has reduced from €2.095m in 2007 to €1.364m in 2011.Given the technical complexity of the sectors which my Department oversees and, in some instances regulates, there is a requirement to procure specialised services to address specific issues as they arise. The Department therefore also necessarily incurs some expenditure on outsourced services as part of programme expenditure, an element of which is consultancy in nature. I will forward the figure for the consultancy element to the Deputy when it is disaggregated from the larger programme spend.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.I have no function in relation to the matters raised by the Deputy.  I have however, made enquiries with SAORVIEW.  There is no registration system for installers of TV equipment in this country.  I have been informed that SAORVIEW has established relationships with three trade bodies representing installers — the Irish Satellite and Aerial Association (ISAA), the National Guild of Master Craftsmen, and the Confederation of Aerial Industries (CAI).  It is my understanding that SAORVIEW has agreed with each of the bodies to the incorporation of the term "recognised by SAORVIEW" as part of each Group's logo, which can be displayed by installers who are members of the respective Groups and who adhere to certain conditions as set out by SAORVIEW.I have been informed by SAORVIEW that it is very vigilant in monitoring the use of the SAORVIEW brand and follow up on complaints and any misrepresentation of SAORVIEW and, in certain instances, this has lead to legal correspondence being entered into.  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that, in terms of members of the public being solicited on a door-to-door basis by installers, neither SAORVIEW nor RTÉ are sending representatives to people's doors to check their televisions or aerials nor have they commissioned or endorsed any door to door sales activities under the SAORVIEW or RTÉ brand.  Should the Deputy be aware of anyone misusing the SAORVIEW brand, or engaging in such misrepresentation, I would ask him to contact SAORVIEW directly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I am very much aware of the challenges digital switchover brings, in particular for households that are reliant on the existing "free to air" analogue TV network.  It is estimated that about 250 thousand households are solely reliant on the Irish analogue TV network.  A further 350 thousand households use the network for secondary TV's or as a back up.  The necessary assistance and support for everyone but in particular for those households who need to make the switch to digital is being provided through a substantial national information campaign.  In addition there is a community outreach programme aimed at providing local assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in society.  As I have stated in reply to previous questions, I do not propose to introduce grant schemes for this purpose.Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and as competition increases in the market.  There is clear evidence that this is now happening in Ireland with affordable set top boxes that meet the SAORVIEW standard on the market, as well as a wide range of suitable digital televisions.  A small SAORVIEW TV can cost as little as €120 and set top boxes are now retailing from €70 or less.  Experience from other European countries however shows that the availability of accurate and reliable information and the provision of practical assistance is the most effective approach towards assisting people in making the switch to digital television.In this regard, therefore, to overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, I have undertaken to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover, the 24 October date for analogue switch off and on their options for going digital.  This information campaign commenced in quarter four 2011 and includes a dedicated telephone helpline, 1890 840 980, a website www.goingdigital.ie, information booklets, TV and radio Ads and a PR campaign.  An information booklet will also be delivered to every house in the country in the coming months.  In conjunction with this, my Department has been working to address the particular information and assistance needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  On January 10th   2012, I signed an agreement with a national voluntary organisation, the Wheel, to develop and operate a nationwide community outreach digital switchover programme (Outreach Programme).The Wheel, in conjunction with other voluntary and community organisations throughout the country, has now begun to roll out the countrywide Outreach Programme through a network of recently appointed county-based local Champions.  The aim of the Outreach Programme, which will provide additional assistance and advice at community level to those who may find the move to digital TV difficult, is to ensure that everybody is made aware of the switchover and that no TV viewers are left without a TV service once the national analogue TV service switches off in October.  A press release issued on the Outreach Programme and is available on the dedicated digital switchover website www.goingdidital.ie  as is the list of local champions referred to above.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 88, 92, 93 and 95 together.The provision of electronic communications services including broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for competing service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have not offered services on a commercial basis.  In the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), for example, services are available from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) where a lack of broadband access had been identified.  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS), which was launched last year, will serve individual premises that are unable to receive a broadband service, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  Completion of the RBS programme later this year means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.International comparisons on broadband access are complicated and difficult to assess.  Comparisons by the OECD, for example, are based on published speeds offered by the largest service providers in each country.  These comparisons do not take account of high bandwidth circuits which are negotiated bilaterally between the customer and service provider in each case.  In addition, the country comparisons are based on a ranking of advertised headline speeds only, which do not take account of actual speeds experienced by customers.  Akamai, http://www.akamai.com/, an infrastructure provider to the Internet industry with servers located in 650 cities and 72 countries, on the other hand, publishes quarterly data which, among other things, measures and compares average and peak speeds available to customers across 49 countries.The OECD broadband survey for September 2011, positions Ireland 30th in a ranking of countries based on the fastest advertised broadband speed.  This compares to Akami's report for September 2011 ranking Ireland 13th globally and 7th within Europe for the highest average peak connection speeds provided.  Similarly in the case of average speeds, Ireland is 21st in the ranking of highest average advertised speeds by the OECD compared to an Akami ranking of 8th globally and 4th   within Europe for its average connection speed of 7Mbps.  This compares to 8.5 Mbps provided in the Netherlands, the highest ranked of 23 European countries and South Korea at 16.7Mbps, the highest ranked of the 49 countries compared.  It also has to be borne in mind these are average speeds by country which do not reflect actual speeds available in particular areas or regions of the countries compared.  Therefore, insofar as comparable broadband statistics on average and peak speeds provided are available, Ireland hovers about the limit of the top quartile of countries compared when measured on speeds provided and performs far better in a comparison of actual speeds measured than it does in a comparison of marketed headline speeds.There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access and associated fast speeds to every home and business in the State.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I convened last summer, has had an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce, among other things, was to assist in developing a roadmap for the development of next generation networks across Ireland.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Taskforce report has now been published today.  The report notes that by 2015 50% of the population will have access to highspeed broadband services with speeds in excess of 70 Mbps.  The report also highlights areas where Government and industry can work together to facilitate the roll out of high speed services across Ireland, and particularly in areas where the case for commercial investment is marginal.  I have also today launched a 4 week consultation process, following on the publication of the Taskforce report.  The purpose of this consultation is to provide further input to this important policy area.  Thereafter, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government for a National Broadband Plan for Ireland.  This plan will build on the recent excellent progress made and be informed by the findings of the Taskforce and subsequent consultations.Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 11.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I do not have a statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or unregulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is entirely a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Prices in the retail electricity market for both domestic and business customers are now fully deregulated, as are those in the retail gas market for business customers.  Since October 2011, CER only regulates the gas price charged by Bord Gáis Energy to domestic consumers.  Prices charged to electricity customers, domestic and business, and to business gas customers, are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the suppliers.  Ireland's electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.The Government recognises that the cost of energy in Ireland is a serious competitiveness issue facing all energy consumers during this difficult period for the economy.  The provision of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies is critical for the economy and is a challenge we are determined to meet.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in North Africa, Japan and the Middle East and high demand from the emerging economies of China and India.  Volatile high prices have continued in global markets since the start of 2012.  International oil and gas prices are set to rise further over the coming months.  These trends will have an impact on domestic electricity and gas prices, and were reflected in the CER's decision to allow an increase in BGE's regulated gas tariff for the residential sector in October 2011 and in the recent increases in domestic electricity prices announced by the suppliers competing in that market.Given Ireland's heavy reliance on imported gas and oil and relatively small market size, it is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market.  The economy is therefore vulnerable to fossil fuel price fluctuations and price rises.  Competitor countries are in many instances facing the same prospect and the objective in the context of higher global prices must be that we retain or improve our competitive position.  Ireland's concerns about high oil and gas prices are shared at EU level and fellow Member Countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  The EU and IEA agree that high fossil fuel prices, which pose a threat to economic recovery, underline the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by radically enhanced energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy.At a national level, competitive markets in electricity and gas help put downward pressure on prices.  Focus must also be maintained on actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, employment and for economic recovery.  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible, including sustained focus on energy efficiency measures.The most recent analysis of data compiled by EuroStat for electricity and gas prices in the European Union, published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), covers the period January to June 2011.  The figures show Irish electricity and gas prices performing well by reference to the EU average  for medium to large business customers (above 2,000 MWh/annum).  The VAT-exclusive electricity price in Ireland for these business consumers ranged from 10% to 17% below the EU average and from 13% to 19% below the Eurozone average.  These customers accounted for 48% of the business electricity market.  Prices for gas customers were below the EU average by between 4% and 25% for most business gas categories.Larger domestic electricity consumers, representing 64% of the domestic electricity market (over 5,000 kWh/annum) experienced price reductions between 6.1% and 7.6% over the period.  The prices for these consumers were between 7% and 19% below the EU average.  In the first half of 2011 natural gas prices for household consumers fell by 3.3%.  The EU average for gas price reductions for the same period was 1.4%.  For this period the price of gas for Irish householders was 10% below the EU average.  EuroStat price data for the second half of 2011 will be available and published by the SEAI next month.

I have been very encouraged by the manner in which the by-elections of April 1 were conducted.  The credibility of the recent election process has been a testament to the commitment of President Thein Sein and the Burmese Government to advancing the causes of democracy, peace and reform in Burma.  I warmly congratulate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the members of the National League for Democracy on their recent election to Burma's parliament.  They, and others, have struggled for many years to bring freedom and democracy to the people of Burma and now have the opportunity play a defining role in shaping the future of their country.The situation in Burma has greatly improved and Ireland has always remained ready to respond positively to genuine progress towards democratisation and respect for human rights.  In April, together with my EU colleagues, we decided to suspend all sanctions against Burma with the exception of the arms embargo and the embargo on equipment which might be used for internal repression.  At the ASEAN European Ministerial Meeting last week, which was attended by my colleague the Minister of State for European Affairs, the EU praised ASEAN's role on Burma and the courage of the Burmese Government in pushing through reforms, while cautioning about the challenges ahead.  The ASEAN side underlined the fact that Burma will need a lot of support in coming years, welcomed the measures taken by the EU Foreign Affairs Council in suspending sanctions and urged the EU to work towards the full lifting of sanctions.I remain concerned that an unknown number of political prisoners remain incarcerated.  Ireland urges the Burmese Government to release all political prisoners unconditionally as an indication that it is firmly committed to change and reform.  I am confident that the Burmese Government will continue to address the concerns of ethnic minority groups and work towards the establishment of comprehensive human rights protection for the people of Burma.Ireland has been funding organisations working in Burma for a number of years and over the last four years has given €6 million to NGOs and missionaries working on long term and emergency responses.  I am hopeful that recent developments will facilitate increased cooperation between the European Union, including Ireland, and Burma, as it continues its journey of reform and democratisation.    I expect to speak with Aung San Suu Kyi, members of the National League for Democracy and other civil society organisations at an appropriate occasion in the future.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	455	At the outset it is important to distinguish between the 3% stamp duty on non-life insurance premiums and the 2% insurance compensation fund (ICF) levy which was introduced on non-life insurance premiums on 1 January of this year.  The former forms a part of general stamp duty receipts and is paid into the Central Fund along with other tax receipts. The latter is a levy which is being used to finance the ICF in order to meet the deficit arising from the administration of Quinn Insurance Ltd (QIL).The ICF operates under the Insurance Act 1964. Its purpose is to protect policy holders in the event of their insurer becoming insolvent.  This protection allows policyholders of QIL to receive the benefit of their policies rather than a partial settlement or a nil settlement. The responsibility for deciding whether the ICF has sufficient funds available to it at any particular time is a matter for the Central Bank. Where in the Bank's opinion the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer. This is calculated as a percentage (not exceeding 2%) of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State. On the basis of its assessment of the Fund late last year the Central Bank concluded that a levy should be applied to industry with effect from 1 January 2012.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The €90 million additional cost in 2012 of using a Government bond to meet the Promissory Note   payment due at the end of March instead of borrowing under the EU/IMF Programme was estimated by subtracting the €80 million interest costs under the Programme from the total estimated cost of €170 million arising from the Government bond.  This total cost, based on a   projected nominal issuance of €3.53 billion, had two elements.  The first element consisted of the estimated interest arising from the coupon   of 5.4% and the second, technical adjustment, relates to the difference between the project nominal issuance of €3.53 billion and its €3.06 billion market value.The rationale for the technical adjustment is that the difference between the nominal and market values has to be accounted for in general government deficit terms.  Under ESA95 accounting rules, this difference is classified as interest and accrued over the lifetime of the bond.  Due to changes in pricing, a lower bond nominal amount of €3.46 billion was issued giving a difference between the nominal and the market value of around €400 million.  Based on the remaining bond term of just under 13 years, the annual accrual in a full year is €30.8 million (€400 million divided by 13).  In respect of the calendar year 2012, as the bond was issued at the end of March 2012, the accrual amount for three quarters of 2012 is estimated to be around €23m.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	460	Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel. This is an international phenomenon driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.  The excise rates (including the carbon charge) in Ireland on motor fuels are 58.8 cent per litre of petrol and 47.9 cent per litre of auto-diesel. However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour the UK. The rates for petrol and auto-diesel were increased with effect from 7 December 2011, arising from an increase in the carbon charge for those fuels from €15 to €20 per tonne of CO2 emitted. This represented an increase of less than 1.5 cent per litre in the case of petrol and just over 1.5 cent per litre in the case of diesel, when VAT is included. The rate of VAT that applies to those fuels increased from 21% to 23% with effect from 1 January 2012.A derogation under EU Directive 2003/96 on Energy Taxation allowed the application of a reduced rate of Mineral Oil Tax to fuel used for the purposes of certain road passenger services. That derogation has expired and the arrangement was, therefore, terminated by the Finance Act 2008. It would not be possible, having regard to the relevant provisions of EU law, to re-introduce a scheme of that nature for those services.Passenger transport services are exempt from VAT.  This means that that VAT is not charged on the passenger service and the passenger transport provider cannot claim input deductibility on any VAT incurred on costs related to their business, including any VAT paid on fuel costs.  As such, the supply of fuel is subject to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.The exemption from VAT on passenger transport services is the subject of a derogation from the normal VAT rules, where passenger transport is normally subject to VAT at either the standard or reduced rates.  Under the EU VAT Directive it is not possible to allow persons who supply exempt services to claim VAT input deductibility, this would equate to zero-rated treatment and zero rated treatment can only apply to those goods and services that were subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991.  In this regard it is not possible to allow passenger transport providers to claim the VAT incurred on their fuel costs.

At my direction NAMA entered into a re-purchase agreement with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited whereby it advanced €3.06 billion to IBRC on a short-term basis. This agreement has a maximum duration of 90 days. Having adjusted for this temporary re-purchase agreement, NAMA currently holds cash and liquid investments of €1.54bn.

In line with Government arrangements for appointments to State boards and bodies expressions of interest in respect of vacancies on the Board were invited via the website of my Department in February 2011. However, it should be noted that under the Government arrangements Ministers are not confined to those who make expressions of interest, as long as all appointees are relevantly qualified.The appointment of John Mulcahy to the Board of NAMA was recommended to me by Frank Daly, Chair of NAMA and his appointment by me was consistent with a key recommendation in the Geoghegan report that I should introduce greater property skill sets to the Board.  Expressions of interest received will be assessed as part of my consideration of appointments to the remaining vacancy on the NAMA Board.

The Troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider options for re-engineering the notes in terms of the maturity of the notes, the interest rate, the cash flows etc. Work is on-going on this, and we must look at recent developments as an initial step in a process. This is a medium term project. The Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC. As you know, we want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.In tandem with this technical review the Government uses appropriate opportunities to garner support for an approach which is more beneficial to the Irish State. President Draghi regularly attends Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings in Brussels and these meetings provide an opportunity to speak with President Draghi on the margins. The Deputy will also be aware that I travelled to Frankfurt on the 24th of January 2012 to meet President Draghi.

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration  and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children  with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where  appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a  special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range  of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In  special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil  teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically  where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.The Deputy may be aware that my Department previously funded 13 centres through  an ABA pilot scheme. All of the centres which participated in this scheme have  been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism and  operate in line with my Department's policy. The pilot scheme was established in the absence of the network of school-based special classes for children with autism which is now available. The establishment of this network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country has been a key educational priority in recent years. There are now in excess of 450 special classes for children with autism attached to mainstream and special schools.

I am informed that the F103 form submitted to FÁS by the Department of Social Protection in respect of the person in question declares that she is not in receipt of a payment.  Therefore, FÁS is not in a position to pay an allowance.  She is, however, in receipt of an accommodation and meal allowance.  The person in question would need to get in contact with her local DSP Office to progress matters further.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	469	From the commencement of the 2012/13 school year, the use of the Catchment Boundary Area (CB) System as a means of determining eligibility will cease for all pupils newly entering post primary school.  This means that from the 2012/13 school year school transport eligibility for all pupils newly entering a post primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre having regard to ethos and language.  This change was announced as part of Budget 2011 but is not being introduced until the 2012/13 school year in order to allow parents of children newly entering post primary school ample time to consider their school choice options, taking account of the revised school transport eligibility arrangements.At post primary level, the evidence is, as set out in the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Schemes, that the majority of children are attending their nearest post primary school/centre.  Existing catchment boundary pupils who are not attending their nearest post primary centre will retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances.  Siblings of these pupils may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only in accordance with the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme.  The changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme will be applied equitably on a national basis.

My Department provides funding to Vocational Education Committees (VECs) nationwide for a range of part-time and full-time accredited and non-accredited further and adult education programmes.  Part-time programmes are available free of charge to anyone with a less than upper second level education.Youthreach for early school leavers and the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) for unemployed people over 21 years of age including lone parents and those on disability allowances are full-time programmes that are also free.  Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) full-time programmes are for school leavers and adults returning to education and are free to welfare recipients, those who have a medical card and those eligible for receipt of a maintenance grant (other participants pay a €200 participant contribution).  In 2011, there were some 170,000 participants in such programmes and this level of provision is being maintained in 2012.  Individuals can get more information on these programmes from their local VEC.

Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding to meet future demographic demands, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.  The Deputy will appreciate that the primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan, is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place.  This announcement represents major advances in how the school building programme is publicised, and will provide certainty to patrons and school communities concerning the major school building projects that my Department is in a position to progress.School building projects currently in architectural planning, including those projects not included in the five year programme, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  These projects will, in general, complete the design stages of architectural planning and secure planning permission and other necessary statutory approvals.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible at this time to indicate when those projects, including a project for the school in question, will be progressed.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14392	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	475	Cloud computing is one of the key target sectors identified in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.  The Plan outlines the opportunities that cloud computing presents for Ireland arising from the global growth of the cloud computing sector in terms of attracting further foreign direct investment (FDI), supporting the emergence of start- up companies providing technology solutions and services via cloud computing, and, stimulating the use of cloud computing by SMEs and start-up companies.  It also acknowledges that key challenges relating to the need for high speed broadband, energy cost competitiveness and access to a supply of skilled workers must be addressed for these opportunities to be exploited to the full.The Action Plan outlines a number of specific actions for implementation in 2012 to ensure that Ireland can reap the substantial benefits in terms of jobs and growth from the global expansion of cloud computing.  One of these has already been implemented following my announcement last month of the €1.2 million industry led Cloud Computing Research Centre which is being funded by Government.  This centre brings together a team of researchers from DCU, UCC and Athlone Institute of Technology, with a cohort of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies, to establish ways to generate business from cloud computing.  One of the priority objectives for the team is to conduct research on maintaining and managing cloud based applications for businesses of all sizes.A number of other actions, which are designed to ensure that Ireland can fully exploit the employment potential offered by cloud computing, will be implemented throughout this year in accordance with the Action Plan.  These include:examining the potential for demonstration projects in cloud computing to promote Ireland as a centre of excellence for this technology, provide a reference site for Irish companies, while potentially lowering costs and improving services;supporting industry groups, such as the Irish Software Association, to develop and deliver a practical tool kit to assist SMEs in assessing the adoption of Cloud Computing for their business;supporting research groups in areas of relevance to exploitation of cloud computing, such as semantic web and financial stock analysis, through, for example, support for the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI).  In other areas, such as middleware, information security, distributed computing, researchers are furthering research in this area with direct application in the cloud computing context;ensuring that the ICT Skills Action Plan, which is being implemented to address the shortage in ICT skills, incorporates the needs associated with the development of cloud computing in Ireland; and,Developing a Cloud Computing Procurement Standard with Industry experts through an NSAI Standards group.Progress reports on all of these actions will be provided on a quarterly basis throughout the year.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21598	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	477	The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntarist in nature with the terms and conditions of employment of workers being determined in the main by a process of voluntary negotiation and agreement without the direct intervention of the State.  In general, Irish law does not try to impose a solution on parties to an industrial relations dispute, but rather is designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences.  Employer and trade union interests have remained committed to this approach in the interest of the harmonious conduct of industrial relations for more than half a century. The State takes a supportive role, by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper, rather than an interventionist one.  Institutions such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court were established to assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers.The experience and expertise of the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best avenue for resolving issues in dispute. In this context, it is expected that the parties to a dispute come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the decisions or recommendations made.  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process. The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences.  Ultimately, responsibility for the resolution of disputes remains a matter for the parties involved.  I have no plans to make any changes to Industrial Relations Acts which would compel either party to a dispute to accept a Labour Court recommendation in disputes referred under those Acts.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21598	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	478	South Africa is recognised as a priority market for Irish exports in the Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment, the implementation of which is being overseen by the Export Trade Council.  This strategy's overall objective is to marshal and coordinate the resources of the State in a way that best supports firms, of all sizes, in all parts of the country, which are trying to trade and grow their business overseas. Implementation of that Strategy will result in the sustained, concentrated and coordinated efforts of all the key Government Departments and agencies, including our embassies and consulates abroad, in support of Irish companies in priority markets, including South Africa.Over 150 Enterprise Ireland clients export to South Africa and the agency's priority this year is to assist clients to maintain and grow existing market share and encourage new exporters to enter the market.  In recognition of the substantial growth in the region and existing significant activity by Irish companies, Enterprise Ireland opened its first South African office in Johannesburg in February 2012.  Enterprise Ireland will also use this as a base to respond to market opportunities in other sub Saharan countries and will work with our diplomatic missions in Africa in this context.  Budget 2012 introduced an innovative tax incentive, where an individual spends 60 days a year outside the country developing their export business into five key high-growth markets, including South Africa.  This measure will support Ireland's export drive in South Africa and encourage efforts by multinational and indigenous firms seeking to expand their export business there.A key instrument of the Government to pursue trade expansion is that of Trade Missions. As Minister for Trade and Development, in November 2011 Jan O'Sullivan TD led a Trade Mission to Johannesburg and Cape Town as part of a broad long term strategy to further develop trade links in the region.  Later this year a further Ministerial led Trade Mission is planned for South Africa which will focus on the software and services sector.  In September 2011, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Eamon Gilmore launched a strategy to improve trade and investment links with Africa.  The Africa Strategy recognises South Africa as an increasingly important market for Irish exports and sets out a framework for Ireland's business, political and development relations with Africa over the coming years.

The changes introduced in the Act are being brought in over time between now and 2015.  This reform recognises parental choice with regard to the care of young children and, simultaneously, holds an expectation that parents will not remain outside of the workforce indefinitely.In view of the changes that have been introduced in the Act, there is a need to address the issues pertinent to the provision of appropriate education, training, employment and child care supports — including after-school care — to both lone parents and other groups who are seeking to access educational and training opportunities and/or re-join the workforce.  Discussions have taken place and are on-going between my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with regard to the   provision of child care and after-school care.  This includes the assessment of the extent of the current provision of such care, the costs of such care to parents, and the demand for such services from lone parents.  These discussions will now be extended to include the Department of Education and Skills in the context of exploring the possible role they could play in relation to the provision of after-school care.  The Government will consider these matters further in the context of developing it's approach to Budget 2013.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	488	My Department is currently engaged in two reviews that impact on Community Employment. One of these reviews is a review of Departmental Labour Market Activation Measures generally and the other is a financial review of Community Employment that aims to secure savings in the expenditure on materials and training grants in 2012 compared to that in 2011.  The financial review of Community Employment (CE) Schemes is now nearing completion and to date no scheme has closed as a result of reductions to the materials and training grants. The review has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.I have given assurances to CE Drugs Rehabilitation projects that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in the training and material grants. My Department acknowledges that in most rehabilitative responses to addiction and drug misuse the focus on training to secure employment outcomes is regarded as an essential element of successful interventions.  The CE Drug Rehabilitation Projects are working with the Department's Community Development Officers to ensure that there is adequate funding for the continuation of the valuable work undertaken by such schemes.While the baseline amount of the materials and training grant remains the €500 per participant announced in the Budget, there is scope to make an amount of up to €1,000 per participant available to schemes in respect of the training and materials grant. The onus is on Sponsors to make the case for the appropriate level of the grant for their individual scheme.  In the world of recovery from addiction, good practice shows that labour market participation is one of the surest ways to enhance self-esteem and reinforce stability and recovery. This balance between rehabilitation and training has been in the past, and will remain at the core of Community Employment on Drug Rehabilitation projects.  I am particularly keen to maintain access to an adequate level of training for persons on these projects. I can give assurances that the 1,000 Drugs Taskforce places will remain in place and continue to be ring-fenced.  As of 30th March, there were 852 participants on drug rehabilitation places on CE.In recognition of the requirements for the delivery of training provision for people recovering from drug addiction, nine special conditions have been agreed to support the delivery of drug rehabilitation places on Community Employment. These conditions cover participant eligibility, referral, programme delivery and expected outcomes. In addition the Supervisor to participant ratio is 1:7 under standard CE — the normal Supervisor/participant ratio is 1:15. As stated there is also a policy review of Activation Measures underway and this review coupled with the policy approaches outlined as part of the Pathways to Work process will inform future developments in relation to CE and similar programmes.

Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of "property owned but not personally used or enjoyed" is assessable for means testing purposes for social assistance payments. Such property includes houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. However, it does not include property such as the family home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business.For assessment purposes, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a formula.  The current market value of a property is the best estimate of what would be achievable if the property was offered for sale. Such an estimate will have regard to reductions in prices over recent years. Where the current market value is less than the outstanding mortgage, no assessment is made.  There are no plans to change the assessment of second properties for social assistance schemes.  Any changes to the wide range of social protection schemes and services operated by my Department will be considered in a Budgetary context later this year.

This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme now comprises a payment of €1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State. An additional once-off payment of €500 will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.Details of the number of applications under the scheme acknowledged by my Department up to 27 April 2012, the number of those applicants expressing an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs, and the number of payments made are set out in the tables.Payments have been made on the basis that applicants have indicated that they fulfil all the qualifying criteria of the scheme in the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme application form.  My Department has been checking and will be continuing to check that all of the qualifying criteria of the scheme have been met. To date, no applicant has been informed that he or she does not fulfil the qualifying criteria.In a significant number of cases, delays in making payments are due solely to the fact that application forms contain some gaps in the information required. My Department is seeking to make direct contact with applicants in such cases so that payments can issue as soon as possible. In that regard, in recent weeks approximately 230 telephone calls have been made to progress outstanding applications for compensation.Site CodeSite NameCountiesTotal acknowl-edgedNumber expressing an interest in relocationNumber of payments made000006Killyconny Bog (Cloghbally)Cavan/Meath4380000231Barroughter BogGalway28813000248Cloonmoylan BogGalway35518000285Kilsallagh BogGalway17611000296Lisnageeragh Bog and Ballinstack TurloughGalway1345000297Lough CorribGalway/Mayo3839000301Lough Lurgeen Bog/Glenamaddy TurloughGalway2265000326Shankill West BogGalway633000382Sheheree (Ardagh) BogKerry200000391Ballynafagh BogKildare542719000497Flughany BogMayo/Sligo1536000566All Saints Bog and EskerOffaly620000572Clara BogOffaly1016248000575Ferbane BogOffaly430000580Mongan BogOffaly511000581Moyclare BogOffaly242114000582Raheenmore BogOffaly000000585Sharavogue BogOffaly200000592Bellanagare BogRoscommon1123158000597Carrowbehy/Caher BogRoscommon201000600Cloonchambers BogRoscommon714000604Derrinea BogRoscommon100000614Cloonshanville BogRoscommon602000641Ballyduff/Clonfinane BogTipperary201000647Kilcarren-Firville BogTipperary2039000679Garriskil BogWestmeath000001242Carrownagappul BogGalway1065242001818Lough Forbes ComplexLongford/Roscommon1030002110Corliskea/Trien/Cloonfelliv BogGalway/Roscommon2949Totals710256278Site CodeSite NameCountiesTotal acknowl-edgedNumber expressing an interest in relocationNumber of payments made000440Lough ReeRoscommon/Longford/ Westmeath952213000595Callow BogRoscommon5667002298River MoyMayo/Roscommon/Sligo2167002331Mouds BogKildare24103002332Coolrain BogLaois1622002333Knockacoller BogLaois1850002336Carn Park BogWestmeath1361002337Crosswood BogWestmeath36232002338Drumalough BogRoscommon402002339Ballynamona Bog and Corkip LoughRoscommon1173002340Moneybeg and Clareisland BogsMeath/Westmeath2959002341Ardagillion BogLongford622002342Mount Hevey BogMeath/Westmeath29117002343Tullaher Lough and BogClare661024002346Brown BogLongford400002347Camderry BogGalway830002348Clooneen BogLongford711002349Corbo BogRoscommon3295002350Curraghlehanagh BogGalway1881002351Moanveanlagh BogKerry2033002352Monivea BogGalway2423002353Redwood BogTipperary1727002354Tullaghanrock BogRoscommon100002356Ardgraigue BogGalway411Totals559144103

As a result, my Department has put in place new arrangements focusing on bringing forward relocation projects to meet the needs of the affected communities. This has involved:contacting communities affected by cessation in line with the recommendations contained in the report;accompanying local community representatives on site visits;identifying potential relocation sites;making contact with landowners in a number of cases with a view to commencing negotiations on bog purchases; andmaking arrangements for assessing the suitability of a number of potential relocation sites in terms of peat quality/quantity, access and other relevant infrastructure, as well as the potential numbers that could be accommodated in these relocation sites.Contact with individual communities has taken place at Ministerial level, senior official level and at regional staff level.It should be noted that the issues involved in following up the Quirke Report recommendations are complex. Each bog and each community is unique and the approach to engagement also varies from bog to bog. In the circumstances, it is not possible at this stage to set out the information in the form requested by the Deputy. However, I can assure him that my Department will follow up with all queries received from either individuals or local committees.

Reference was made in that document to the need for screening for appropriate assessment where there is a distance of 15 kilometres between a proposed plan area and a Natura 2000 site (such as a raised bog special area of conservation).  The reference to 15 kilometres relates to plans, such as County Development Plans, and not to projects, such as applications for planning permission from individual citizens.

Three of the discoveries were in the North Celtic Sea and one in the Slyne Basin.  Applications for lease undertakings in respect of two of the discoveries in the Celtic Sea are under consideration by the Department at present. With regard to non-petroleum minerals as of 30 April 2012, there are 586 mineral prospecting licences currently held by 45 companies.While no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered in the past ten years, there have been some encouraging results, particularly in Counties Limerick and Clare.  However, it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits or to estimate the economic benefits that might accrue.  Details of all the petroleum exploration licences and other mineral prospecting licences can be found in the six-monthly report to the Oireachtas, which I am obliged to lay before the Houses under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999.  The last such report was in respect of the six-month period ending 31 December 2011. These reports are also available on the Department's website at: http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Natural/.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.I do not have a statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or unregulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Prices in the retail business and residential electricity markets are now fully deregulated.  From 1 October 2011 gas residential consumers supplied by Bord Gáis Energy are the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are still regulated by the CER.  Prices in the electricity and gas markets, with the exception of residential gas customers supplied by Bord Gáis Energy, are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the suppliers concerned. Ireland's electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.The Government recognises that the cost of energy in Ireland is a serious competitiveness issue facing energy consumers during this difficult period for the economy.  The provision of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies is critical for the economy and is a challenge we are determined to meet.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011, driven by events in North Africa, Japan and the Middle East and by high demand from the emerging economies of China and India.  These trends are leading to higher domestic electricity and gas prices.  Given Ireland's heavy reliance on imported gas and oil and relatively small market size, it is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market.  The economy is therefore vulnerable to fossil fuel price fluctuations and price rises.  Competitor countries are in many instances facing the same prospect and the objective in the context of higher global prices must be that we retain or improve our competitive position.Ireland's concerns about high oil and gas prices are shared at EU level and by fellow Member Countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  The EU and IEA agree that high fossil fuel prices which pose a threat to economic recovery underline the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by radically enhanced energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy.At a national level, our competitive energy market helps put downward pressure on prices.  Energy suppliers compete with each other for market share by offering a variety of prices and products to consumer who may then choose the most advantageous offering.  In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, employment and for economic recovery.  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible through those measures at our disposal including sustained focus on energy efficiency and renewables.  I would urge all businesses to engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to access the Authority's energy efficiency support programmes.The latest analysis of data published by EUROSTAT for electricity and gas prices is published by the SEAI and covers the period January to June 2011.  The figures show Irish electricity and gas prices performing well by reference to the EU average for medium to large business customers (above 2,000 MWh/annum).  The VAT-exclusive electricity price in Ireland for these business consumers ranged from 10% to 17% below the EU average and from 13% to 19% below the eurozone average.  These customers accounted for 48% of the business electricity market.  Prices for gas customers were below the EU average by 4% to 25% for most business gas categories.  The EUROSTAT figures also show that larger domestic electricity consumers, representing 64% of the domestic electricity market (over 5,000 kWh/annum), experienced price reductions between 6.1% and 7.6% over the period.  The prices for these consumers were between 7% and 19% below the EU average.The same source shows that in the first half of 2011 natural gas prices for household consumers fell by 3.3%.  The EU average for gas price reductions for the same period was 1.4%.  For this period the price of gas for Irish householders was 10% below the EU average.

Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.  It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5 km tunnel, which began last year, will take in the region of three years.  First gas cannot therefore reasonably be anticipated before 2014.

The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, which was enacted in August 2011, has put in place a robust and appropriate regulatory framework for the postal services market, which will offer certainty and protection to An Post, the designated universal postal service provider, its competitors, and postal service users.  While I have overall responsibility for the postal sector, the Act charges the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as the postal regulator, with the promotion of the development of the postal sector, particularly the availability of the universal postal service, the promotion of the interests of users and the facilitation of the development of competition in the sector.

In this regard, I would note that the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman were established by industry to safeguard and promote professional and ethical standards in Irish newspapers and magazines, and have been formally recognised under Section 44 of the Defamation Act 2009, which falls under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.As the Deputy is aware, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is established as an independent statutory body under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Part 3 of the 2009 Act also outlines the codes governing standards and practice to be observed by broadcasters.  The Compliance Committee of the BAI is charged under the Act with ensuring that all broadcasters, whether public or private, comply with their licence conditions and with the standards set out in the broadcasting codes and rules.In line with its statutory obligations, the BAI recently launched a draft ‘Code of Fairness Objectivity and Impartiality in News and Current Affairs', for a period of public consultation.  The BAI proposals include rules which, if implemented, will require broadcasters to maintain a Public Register of Interests, such as that outlined by the Deputy.  The draft rules, which are available on the BAI website, include, inter alia, the provision that: "personnel with an editorial role in news and current affairs shall enter details of all financial or commercial relationships that might be perceived as representing a material influence on them in, or in relation to, the performance of such editorial role, together with an indication or any individuals or companies to which the personnel in question may be deemed to owe a fiduciary duty".  The Authority is now considering the responses received during the public consultation period, which ran until 14 March, and will publish the finalised Code in due course.

Sections of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 dealing with social housing support, and related Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, were commenced on 1 April 2011.  The Regulations contain national eligibility criteria, including maximum income limits.  These mandatory criteria must be applied by all housing authorities in assessing a household's eligibility for social housing support.  The new arrangements seek to streamline the process of applying for social housing support, both for the applicant and the local authority.

For this reason, if either member of a separated couple applies, local authorities require evidence of legal separation or divorce before considering a household's eligibility for long-term housing support, as the separation agreement will provide certainty regarding ownership of property.Authorities have been given guidance on these provisions by my Department and by the Housing Agency and take account of them when making decisions on social housing assessment applications.  I acknowledge, however, that situations may exceptionally arise that may not easily be dealt with under the current Regulations.  My Department is currently reviewing the social housing assessment provisions and will consider what wider discretion might be given to housing authorities to address the individually difficult and complex cases which may present to them.

In the year to end September 2011, some 200 kilometres of public water supply pipes had been replaced or rehabilitated under this programme.   Funding is particularly targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.Since the national water conservation programme was implemented in 2003, over €208 million has been specifically invested in water conservation measures by my Department.  In addition, local authorities fund active leakage control, detection and repair from their own operational budgets.  Most of the effort to date has been focused on putting in place the water management systems to allow for active leakage control and better planning of mains rehabilitation.  Most local authorities have now prepared watermains rehabilitation strategies, which set out the priority mains for replacement and repair and provide the platform for accelerated investment in this area over the coming years.  The primary objective of this programme of work is to reduce water loss and leakage in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address high levels of unaccounted for water.The proposed water metering programme will complement the continuing programme of investment in water mains rehabilitation and replacement.  The installation of water meters will encourage households to conserve water, reduce consumption and will ensure that customer side leaks can be identified and fixed.  Metering will, therefore, achieve significant reductions in the volumes of water that are required to be produced and treated and will lead to savings in the operational costs of delivering water services and in deferred capital expenditure.  My Department estimates that there is the potential to provide up to 2,000 jobs per annum from the metering programme.  The installation of the meters is labour intensive involving minor excavation and reinstatement works after the installation of the meter.  This will provide much needed employment in the construction sector.

The Deputy will appreciate the complexities involved in drafting a Bill of this nature and that it is important that the provisions of the Bill are legally robust.  This requires careful drafting of the text and full consideration of issues which emerge during the drafting process.  However, I do not envisage that it will be necessary to hold a referendum in relation to any of the provisions of the Bill.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	516	Section 44 of the Defamation Act 2009 provides for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make an Order, subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas granting statutory recognition as a Press Council to a body that seeks recognition as such. It requires that the Minister be satisfied that the applicant body complies with the provisions set out in Schedule 2. No more than one such body can be recognised and the order may be revoked.   On 21 April, 2010, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform signed the Defamation Act 2009 (Press Council) Order 2010 (S.I. No. 163 of 2010) granting recognition to the Press Council of Ireland. The Order took immediate effect.

South Division. These changes were introduced on 29 April 2012. The stations were open to the public on a 24-hour basis and are now closed to the public between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. It is important to remember that while the Garda stations in question will have reduced opening hours to the public, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24-hour basis.The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation. This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.Specifically in relation to D.M.R. South Division, it must be noted that on 29 February 2012, the latest date for which figures were readily available, there were approximately 594 gardaí assigned to the Division of which 168 are assigned to the Crumlin District itself. Sundrive Road Garda Station with a complement of 71 gardaí, forms part of the Crumlin District. There is also 49 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians attached to the D.M.R. South Division. These resources are augmented, when appropriate, by gardaí from national units such as the Garda National Drug Unit and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

This is a very lengthy and complex Bill from a legal standpoint, with proposed provisions which do not currently exist in Irish law. While it was hoped that the Bill would be published by 30 April, work on its development is still proceeding in the context of the many submissions received on the Bill which include, the report of the Joint Oireachtas Justice Committee received in early March following their completion of hearings on the Bill.The Deputy will appreciate that it is important that the provisions of the Bill are legally robust.  This requires careful legal drafting of the text and full consideration of issues which emerge during the drafting process.The Troika team was in Dublin in the past fortnight and progress on the Bill was discussed with them. They are supportive of the provisions contained in the General Scheme of Bill which I published on 25 January last along with my colleague the Minister for Finance.  They appreciate the complexities involved in drafting a Bill of this nature and understand that some additional time is required to finalise the text in preparation for publication.   I expect that the Bill will be one of the matters for discussion with the Troika in the context of their next quarterly review in early July.I can assure the Deputy that the Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and the revised time frame for publication of the Bill is now the end of June next with the strong intention to commence Second stage in the Dáil prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session."

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The emergence in recent years of criminal gangs has had significant implications for the management of Irish prisons.  Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside may continue inside prison.  Prison management have to ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates or criminal activities outside the prisons.  Gang members are being managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership/allegiance to these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated.I am aware of the difficulties for everyone involved and appreciate the efforts made by prison management and staff to deal with this issue on a daily basis within our prisons.   However, the Irish Prison Service is taking whatever steps are necessary to deal with this and has built up considerable experience in this regard.A number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.  For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG) have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.  Core functions of this group include gathering and collating intelligence information on criminal gang members in Irish prisons, carrying out intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband (including mobile phones) into the prisons.In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda Síochána to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs.  Gardaí are also provided with reports detailing the release dates of this category of prisoner.  Furthermore, the Risk Management of Offenders Group within the Irish Prison Service, which is comprised of Governors of all closed prisons and the Governor of the OSG meet on a regular basis to share intelligence and decide in a strategic and collaborative fashion on the placement of leading gang members across the prison estate, having regard to the associated protection issues involved.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 187 of Thursday, 26 April 2012.  The position remains as stated.Reply to Parliamentary Question 187 of 26 April 2012:An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in September 2011.On examination of the application submitted, it was determined that the application was ineligible because the statutory residency conditions as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, were not satisfied. A letter issued to the applicant on 23 April 2012 informing her of the position.It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the prescribed statutory requirements. The on-line Naturalisation Residency Calculator can be used as a guide to whether an individual satisfies the naturalisation residency conditions and, if not, give an indication of how long they should wait before making an application.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	523	There have been ongoing protest actions in the North Mayo area by local campaigners, supported by groups and individuals from outside the area, with a view to preventing progress on the completion of the work required to bring ashore the significant gas reserves which lie in the Corrib Gas field.  I should not need to remind the Deputy of the importance to the national gas supply and to the economy more generally of having this essential infrastructural project completed.It is deeply regrettable that so much Garda resources have to be tied up at the North Mayo site. However this is absolutely necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom as I have said are not from the area and who have engaged in acts of public disorder as well as damage to property. Such action cannot be tolerated and the Garda presence is there to prevent it.  This has left the Gardaí open to accusations that they are facilitating the interests of a multinational company over the interests, and safety concerns, of local residents.  In response to these allegations it has been consistently stated that the Garda presence is to prevent breaches of the peace, to uphold the law and to prevent interference with workers going to and coming from the site. The Garda Commissioner has informed me that the aim of the policing measures currently in place is to prevent public order offences and to ensure that people can go about their lawful business.The Deputy will be aware that the matter of complaints in relation to comments made by a member of An Garda Siochána, were the subject of an independent investigation carried out by the Garda Siochána Ombudsman Commission. On the 24th April 2012,  the Commission stated that it had recommended to the Garda Commissioner (as provided for by Section 97 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005) that disciplinary action should be taken against one of the members complained of. The report of the Commission is currently with the Garda Commissioner.An Garda Síochána is duty-bound to uphold the rule of law without fear or favour, and that is what local Garda management will continue to do in relation to the protests in what is a difficult and confrontational setting which is not of their making.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the incident referred to was the subject of investigation by An Garda Síochána, which resulted in the submission of an investigation file to the law officers, who directed that a person be charged with manslaughter and assault.  At the ensuing trial directions to acquit were given by the judge.  Following the publication of an article concerning this case in October, 2010, representations were made requesting an investigation of the matters raised in it.  I understand that the Commissioner arranged for a Detective Superintendent to meet the author of the article and the persons making the representations to make an assessment of whether there was any evidence which was not available to the original investigation team and if further investigation was required in this case.  As a result, a number of lines of inquiry were identified for examination by An Garda Síochána.   I have received an update on progress on the matter from the Garda Commissioner but the examination remains ongoing and I expect to receive a final report upon its completion, at which point I will review the situation.

The Deputy will recall that the Garda investigation, which commenced in 2006, was a lengthy process due to the complex nature of the investigation which required examination and analysis of a significant volume of information technology data and communications.  In particular I am informed that progress in the investigation was hampered because of the unavailability of a person the Gardaí wished to interview.  I am further informed that an investigation file was submitted to the Law Officers in January 2011 and that, following a number of further enquiries by that office, directions were issued in November 2011 not to prosecute in the case.Insofar as the specific and detailed aspects of the Garda investigation to which he refers are concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that I have no role in these matters or in decisions concerning investigative strategies in any individual case and that these are operational matters for An Garda Síochána on which it would not be appropriate for me to seek details to provide by way of answer to Parliamentary Questions.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are statutory mechanisms in place where persons have complaints against the behaviour of members of An Garda Síochána.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	534	My understanding is that the named person is not in a position, for health reasons, to utilise his quota but is anxious to retain it for a number of years in order to provide his son with access to milk quota, should his son decide to become a dairy farmer.  Under the Milk Quota Regulations, a person who is unable to supply milk for two consecutive quota years is entitled to retain his quota for that period, before it reverts to the National Reserve in April of the third year. During that period he may lease the quota to a qualified relative, or a company in which milk producers hold a majority shareholding. These arrangements may be extended where exceptional circumstances temporarily affect production capacity. I understand that 2012/2013 quota year will be the first year in which the person named does not supply milk. Suppliers entering their third year in this category are contacted by my Department prior to their quota going dormant, giving them the opportunity to explain the reason for their non-supply.However, it should be noted that the milk quota regime will be abolished on 31 March 2015.  After this date, milk production and supply will be a matter for individual milk producers and their respective Co-operatives/Dairies. Consequently, I would advise that the named person might consider contacting his milk purchaser for information regarding its plans for the post milk quota era and whether it is in a position to offer any information regarding his position.  If the named person proposes to reactivate his quota before 31 March 2015 he can contact my Department, who will advise him on his options.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	538	The background to these changes is that the main constraint to the eradication of TB, the presence of the disease in badgers, is now being addressed in a very effective manner and, if we want to progress towards eradication, we need to move on to address some of the other constraints such as the movement of high risk animals and animals from high risk herds. For these reasons, the Department is now re-focusing on the 3 fundamental principles of disease eradication, namely Find, Confine and Eradicate to achieve the ultimate goal of eradication of TB in cattle. Accordingly, the Department is paying increased attention to detecting the disease and preventing its spread to other herds. Thus greater stress is being laid on ensuring all herds test on time and on reducing movement opportunities for potentially infected cattle so as to provide increased protection for clear herds and export markets.These measures are underpinned by research which indicates that movement of animals from the herds in question represents a significant risk to other herd owners who would otherwise buy these animals. For example, Department statistics show that, in 2011, the risk of herds which are contiguous to a high risk breakdown disclosing TB is almost 3 times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test. In view of the fact that contiguous tests were conducted on some 8,000 herds in 2011, involving almost 800,000 animals and resulting in the disclosure of 2,256 reactors, the risk of TB spreading from herds which are contiguous to high risk breakdowns is very significant.The position is that, in the case of the changes to the contiguous testing arrangements, herds which are contiguous to a high risk breakdown were already required to undergo an additional testing regime under the previous arrangements. The only change is that, in order to protect clear herds, these herds are now required to pass a test before they are permitted to sell cattle on the open market. The contiguous testing programme will apply only to those herds contiguous to a high risk breakdown (approximately one third of all restrictions) which, after a risk based epidemiological investigation, are considered to be relevant to the breakdown. In view of this, I am satisfied that the new arrangements will ensure that the number of herds which are subject to the contiguous testing programme is kept to the minimum. Furthermore, herds which test clear will be immediately de-restricted and herdowners can minimise any impact on their trading patterns by having their herds tested as soon as possible after notification by the Department.With regard to herds in which reactors are disclosed, such herds will be restricted in accordance with EU Directive 64/432/EEC. However, these herds are free to sell cattle direct to slaughter. Compensation arrangements are in place to assist farmers whose herds are restricted because of TB.  In conclusion, my Department does not accept that these measures will have any significant negative impact on current trading practices. The objective of the measures is to protect herdowners from buying in infected animals and the costs and trade restrictions associated with the disclosure of TB in a herd. Following the introduction of these measures, farmers can now buy cattle with increased confidence that they are free from TB.

Under the Act establishing Teagasc, it is charged with the provision of research, advice and education services in support of Ireland's agrifood industry.

On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the Clinical Programmes. These Programmes have been developed and implemented by a joint HSE/Departmental group who have also drafted the Framework for the future development of smaller hospitals.  Consultation with all the stakeholders, including patients and public representatives, will be an integral part of the process.   This framework will demonstrate clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure. It will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients. I expect to be in a position to publish the framework shortly.

Under the registration scheme a manufacturer can apply for a certificate of traditional-use registration for their traditional herbal medicinal product.  The scheme enables Irish consumers to have confidence when they buy a herbal medicine that it is safe, manufactured to a high quality and labelled correctly.  Currently, there are no herbal medicinal products containing St. John's Wort registered on the Irish market.  It is open to manufacturers or others to apply to the IMB to have a St. John's Wort product registered under the scheme.  Medicines Regulations currently envisage that medicinal products containing St. John's Wort, other than for external use, may only be supplied on foot of a prescription.

This legislation will not affect prescription charges.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Prelude	553	As the Deputy is aware, the European Commission took a case against the State regarding the VHI's derogation from the EU Non-Life Directives which have exempted it from the requirement to be authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled against the State on 29 September last.  In response to this judgement, the Government agreed to:Engage with the Commission to address the ruling;Work with the VHI and the Central Bank on the VHI's application for authorisation, with a decision to be taken later regarding the question of capitalisation;Examine the legal and legislative requirements to allow for the incorporation of the VHI as a limited company, in order to address the concerns of the EU Commissioner for Competition that the VHI may benefit from an unlimited State guarantee;Examine other options for the future status of the VHI.The Government's plans and a realistic timetable were outlined to the European Commission on 9 December last.  Resolution of the issues will involve a number of steps.  Irish officials have met with officials of both the Directorate General for Competition and the Directorate General for Internal Market and Services since the beginning of the year and will continue to engage with them on an ongoing basis.  The Commission responded on 27 February in a Letter of Formal Notice, a procedural notification that the Commission is obliged to issue within six months of a judgement.  The terms of the Formal Notice have been considered in detail in my Department and following further discussions with the Commission in April, a formal response was issued on behalf of the Government on 26 April.In relation to publication of the response issued to the Commission, this question is being examined at present with regard to the commercial information included in the response.  Subject to any required redaction of commercially sensitive information, it is my intention to publish it as soon as possible.  I can, however, confirm that in addition to summarising the actions undertaken since the judgement was delivered, the response of 26 April emphasises the Irish Government's assurance that the judgement of the European Court of Justice will be addressed as quickly as possible and notes that Irish officials will update the Commission on a quarterly basis in relation to progress, with a commitment to the immediate notification to the Commission should any obstacles to progress arise.

Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct.

I am informed that the St Davnet's site has been selected due to its capacity to accommodate the merged catering services and its potential for future development.  A working group is in place to oversee and implement this project.
