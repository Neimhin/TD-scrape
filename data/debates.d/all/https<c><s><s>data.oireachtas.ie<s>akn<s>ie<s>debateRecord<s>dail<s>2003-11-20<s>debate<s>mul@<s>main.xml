There is also a need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to explain why this was allowed to happen and the steps he will take to ensure this violation is not repeated.</p>

I congratulate the Government on timing it for this morning as it means the senior ranking Minister cannot be in the Chamber to take the Order of Business. I am sure this is a consolation devoutly desired by the Government and it has sent in the safe hands of the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I thought he might have at least brought the second member of the Punchestown duo with him.

My party, Fine Gael and the Green Party have put forward proposals. The Labour Party proposal, a major document, was presented to the Government Whip. Regrettably, it only received coverage in so far as it related to the organisation of sitting time in the House, which was a relatively minor aspect of a major document. For members of the Government to respond to the criticism of the infrequency of their appearance in the House and of the tendency to cause the House to close down at the least excuse by extending the sitting hours in the anti-social fashion being done here is not the way to address Dáil reform. For that reason I am opposed to it.</p>

On behalf of the Green Party, I wish them well in their duties. They are superbly trained and capable of doing the job. May God protect them in their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">We are always told the Government is interested in Dáil reform. What we have here is frenetic activity just before Christmas. When we were students we were told not to cram, and this is an example of cramming. It is not the way to do business. Let us have real Dáil reform, as has been advocated by my colleague, Deputy Boyle, in his paper. I ask the Government Whip to consider his suggestions. This is not the way to legislate. If the Government is serious about Dáil reform, and I have my doubts, Ministers should listen to what the Opposition parties are saying and get real about Dáil reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">It is broadly recognised that the proposition for business today and tomorrow does not equate with Dáil reform. We have a substantive project to address. A little deal was done which allowed the Taoiseach to absent himself on Thursdays, but I was not aware that it applied to a significant number of the other members of the Cabinet and to many other backbench members of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I agree with Deputy Rabbitte and others who have spoken about effective Dáil reform. It would be hypocritical not to support Friday sittings. However, this should not just be for the purposes of being seen to be meeting. There will be no opportunity for Members to ask questions or have a vote during tomorrow's sitting. It seems that having the Dáil sit on a Friday is merely for optics and that the House can be run with a skeleton crew.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">There is consternation among the public about the implementation of the Hanly report, which is referred to in No. 25 on the Order Paper. I note that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, became the latest Minister to break ranks when he stated there would be no downgrading of Portiuncula Hospital on his watch.</p>

The Opposition is expected to man the benches. Let us look at the attendance by Ministers this morning.</p>

While we understand that the Taoiseach will not be able to attend during our forthcoming Presidency of the European Union, in normal circumstances sittings should include the customary Order of Business, Leader's questions, oral questions and so forth. Otherwise it is a sitting in name only and is window dressing. The opportunity presents itself this morning, if one owned a few ponies, to obtain a grant of 100% from the two Ministers present. Other than that, the proposal serves no purpose and the Labour Party will not go along with this sham.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">The battle against tobacco is one of the most important public health challenges facing us in the new millennium. I have made this area one of my main priorities as Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The adverse impact of tobacco consumption on human health globally and locally is well documented. Tobacco smoke is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in Ireland. Medical evidence has repeatedly confirmed tobacco as a cause of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, common cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthmatic attacks, low birth weight babies and sudden infant death syndrome. About 7,000 deaths in Ireland each year are attributable to tobacco related illness. Smoking tobacco products is one of the unhealthiest things a human being can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Life expectancy is lower in Ireland than the EU average and the diseases which contribute primarily to this are heart disease and cancer. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of these diseases. Smoking is a major causative factor in about 90% of the 2000 deaths from lung cancer each year and increases the risk of other cancers such as the mouth and throat. Smoking is also a primary cause of cardiovascular disease, the greatest single cause of mortality in Ireland. Tobacco is a significant burden to individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. Reduction in tobacco use will increase life expectancy in Ireland and result in happier, healthier and better quality lives for many Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Evidence has accumulated year on year of the enormous worldwide threat to human health from consumption of tobacco products. Studies carried out internationally in recent years have also confirmed that there is a significant risk to the health of the non-smoker from inhaling environmental tobacco smoke referred to as passive smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">The Public Health Tobacco Act 2002 was enacted in March 2002. The Act is the most comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation ever in this country and confirmed the commitment of the Government and the Oireachtas to the battle against the tobacco epidemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">The Act brought together a number of legal instruments and replaced two existing Acts, the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act 1978 and the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act 1988 and incorporated certain provisions of the Government's policy, Towards a Tobacco Free Society. Strong legislative measures are an important public health instrument in countering the tobacco threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The main provisions contained in the Act are as follows: a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays, and on all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry; registration of tobacco retailers and tougher penalties for those convicted of under age sales; a ban on retail sales of packs of cigarettes of less than 20; tighter controls on sale of tobacco products from vending machines; a ban on the sale of confectioneries, normally intended for children, which resemble a tobacco product; public disclosure of all aspects of tobacco including toxicity and addiction; and improved protection for people against passive smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The tobacco industry and other related trades commenced legal challenges to the Public Health (Tobacco) Act in June 2002. During the judicial hearings, which involved three sets of proceedings, the court was advised by the State of a problem in regard to a requirement to notify to the EU Commission at Bill stage some of the measures enacted to comply with two EU Directives, 98/34/EC and 98/48/EC. These directives, known as the transparency-technical standards directives, require draft technical regulations to be notified to the EU Commission and to other member states in advance of their adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The procedure is intended to provide transparency and control with regard to technical regulations which impose binding legal rules regulating the characteristics required of a product such as levels of quality, performance, safety or dimensions, including the requirements applicable to the product as regards the name under which the product is sold, terminology, symbols, testing and test methods, packaging, marking or labelling and conformity assessment procedures. National measures of this nature could create unjustified barriers to trade between member states. Their notification in draft form and the subsequent evaluation of their content in the course of the procedure help to diminish this risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The procedure was not followed at Bill Stage with the 2002 Act and, as a result, 14 of the 53 sections of the Act are affected. These sections relate mainly to the sale and marketing of tobacco products. However, other important aspects of the Act such as the establishment of the Office of Tobacco Control and the power to regulate smoking in the workplace remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">As the Act is a public health measure, it was considered originally that it was not notifiable to the Commission as a technical regulation. It was also considered that the requirement to introduce commencement orders in the case of the Act would allow for notification of the commencement order in draft form, thereby meeting the requirements of the transparency directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Following correspondence and discussions with EU Commission officials on this matter and having obtained legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it became clear that any attempt to commence the affected sections would result in considerable uncertainty as to the enforceability of the sections in question. The court was advised of the attempts made through the Commission to resolve the issue and each set of proceedings was discontinued.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Accordingly, I decided that the quickest and most appropriate way of resolving the issue was to repeal the affected sections and to reintroduce them by way of a new Bill which would then be notified under the transparency procedure and, on completion of this procedure, would be re-enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I am advised by the Attorney General's office that with a view to assisting in the defence of any challenge brought to the re-enacted legislation the amending Bill should be used as an opportunity to strengthen the Act in a number of areas. This is being done by, among other things, changing the Long Title of the Act to indicate that the Act is designed to give effect to as many of the EU and international measures as have been adopted at that date. The re-enacted legislation will include those EC measures relating to tobacco products to be transposed into national law.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Since the enactment of the Bill there have been many positive developments at European level and globally. These measures to date are, first, Directive No. 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products. This directive, among other things, requires much larger, more visible and effective health warnings on cigarette packs and provides for member states to make use of graphic warnings. Second is Directive No. 2003/33/EC of the European Parliament and Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products prohibiting tobacco advertising and related sponsorship. This directive will deny the tobacco industry direct access, particularly to young persons, through the print and other media. In Ireland we have implemented a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship since July 2000 but we have always supported the need for strong measures at EU level in the area of advertising of tobacco products and sponsorship by tobacco companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Third is the Council Recommendation of 2 December 2002 on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to improve tobacco control. The recommendation from the Council of the European Union is against a background of 500,000 smoking deaths annually in the European Community and concern over the numbers of adolescents and children who take up smoking. Smoking remains the biggest form of preventable death in the European Union. The Council recommends that member states adopt appropriate legislative and other measures to reduce morbidity and mortality from tobacco and report to them on measures taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was adopted at Geneva on 21 May 2003. This historic ground-breaking international treaty sets the scene to afford protection to many millions of people around the world from the devastating impact of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. The treaty addresses all aspects of tobacco control, including the traditional health interventions such as advertising and sponsorship bans, passive smoking and retail licensing. It also addresses economic and trade issues, including taxation policy, international trade and smuggling. Other areas include product specification and issues of compensation and liability. We have always advocated strong international measures on tobacco control. Many countries have already signed the treaty and in September this year I signed it on behalf of Ireland. The treaty will make a significant contribution to protecting future generations from the predatory practices of the global tobacco industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">In addition, the section dealing with indirect advertising is being removed as the EU directive on the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products does not cover indirect advertising, often referred to as brand stretching. This will strengthen the Act against further legal challenges. The section on prohibition of smoking of tobacco products in specified places is being amended to include the principles and policies which should inform the making of regulations under this section. This amendment does not affect regulations already made under the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Ireland will assume the Presidency of the European Union in January next and plans are under way to hold a major conference in the mid-west region on tobacco control during our Presidency. We have always supported the need for a strong unified approach from the European Union on tobacco control and health. Many countries in the developing world look to the European Union to initiate strong measures in this vital area of public health. The Irish Presidency will be an opportunity to further that aim.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The tobacco industry and its allies seem determined to try to undermine public health policy in the area of tobacco control. Perhaps we should regard this as testimony to how effective the measures contained in the Bill will be when enacted and commenced. We must not lose sight of the predatory nature of the tobacco industry. It is a global industry which has long-regarded the World Health Organisation as its greatest enemy in preventing the spread of the global tobacco epidemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Much has been achieved in reducing the incidence of smoking in our population. By a combination of measures including legislation, regulation, health promotion and education we were able to achieve a level of 27% for 2002 as shown in the SLAN survey published earlier this year. More recent surveys conducted by the Office of Tobacco Control indicate smoking levels dropping to 25%. This is welcome news and the reduction achieved will have many benefits, particularly for future generations who will come to accept non-smoking as the social norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Our success in improving the health status of the nation is linked to further reducing the level of tobacco usage and in particular preventing young persons from starting to smoke. If the incidence of tobacco use can be reduced further we can make considerable progress towards a tobacco-free and a healthier society in the years to come. I am not suggesting that legislation alone, no matter how comprehensive, can create and sustain the environment necessary to prevent people from starting to smoke and to assist those who have already started to quit. Our anti-tobacco strategy will be multifaceted, containing as it will strong legislative controls and effective enforcement powers. However, the strategy will also have a fiscal element and the supports required by smokers to quit.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">The implementation of this comprehensive strategy will, in time, effect the necessary attitudinal changes in society to tobacco consumption followed by the necessary behavioural changes. We owe it to ourselves, to the younger generation, and, indeed, to future generations to ensure that the war against tobacco is won. We must ensure that the children and young people of today do not become future victims of the tobacco industry, whether through being induced to smoke tobacco products or through exposure to and inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke.</p>

However, there are things that must be said.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The Minister has spoken about the need for this ban. I support that view and have been steadfast in my support for the ban and persuaded my party to be likewise.

          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_165">I have not been very long in the House – this is my second term – but uniquely, in my experience, no explanatory memorandum was issued with the legislation. Some might say that was because it defied explanation. The Minister produced a limited explanatory note which I received from the Whip's Office but it was very limited. It referred only to some aspects of the legislation and did not clarify the purpose of some of the changes or precisely what they are trying to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The changes to which the Minister referred are primarily linked to the advertising and marketing section of the original Bill which have been wisely transposed into Irish law. The EU transparency directive has more or less informed the way the legislation has been worded, which makes sense. It will increase the robustness of the legislation and give it the backing of all EU directives in this regard. That will help it withstand any challenges, and there will be challenges which will probably at some stage end up in the European Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">How did the legislation run foul of the European Commission in the first place, and why did this possibility never occur to anybody? While in hindsight all vision is perfect, it seems strange that no one thought that an Act, part of whose title contains the words "control of the sale" and "control of the marketing", might have implications for the barriers to trade and fall foul of European competition law. Clearly nobody here recognised the problem but somebody more perspicacious did and it was determined that the legislation should have been notified to the European Commission under the Transparency Directive. This should be a warning to us that lawyers will be looking at every word of this legislation. That is why we are here today discussing this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The Minister has told us several times that it has been successfully notified to the Commission and the three month limit has expired. In a catalogue of almost incredible mishandling of a relatively straightforward Act the first mistake was made when the failure to notify was discovered. The Minister decided that although certain aspects of the Act did contravene EU legislation, the rest of the legislation would not be affected by the Council's finding. This may well be the case and we might get away with it in almost any other area of legislation had this not been legislation whose implications would seriously upset the balance sheets of some wealthy and aggrieved cigarette and tobacco companies. While the future of the tobacco companies does not hinge on what happens in Ireland in normal circumstances in terms of how much smoking we do, it certainly hinges on the overall European and western markets, where Governments may well take encouragement from a successful ban in Ireland. I hope the effect in Ireland will be that the ban will end, or greatly reduce, smoking as a public social activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">It is clearly necessary to dot every "i" and cross every "t" but the Minister found himself not only with legislation which had been partially rejected because it contravened EU law, but in addition, since most of section 47 was rejected, it was foolhardy to assume that section was robust. The legislation was seriously compromised at that stage, but clearly the decision was made to plough ahead regardless.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Through the summer we saw the choreographed and orchestrated media circus in which the Minister was the hero of every scene. In fairness to him, it was harmless enough in the silly season, except that it was a waste of valuable time and a distraction when the Minister might well have been attending to the details of the amended Bill and regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">What the Minister is now doing is not harmless. It is foolhardy and, at worst, downright stupid. I refer in particular to changes in the legislation which incidentally are not mentioned either in the note sent to our offices the night before last or in what the Minister said today. I refer to the changes he is making to section 47. This is the section which entitles the Minister to implement the smoking ban. The Minister has made two separate sets of regulations under the former section 47. The second set was sent to the EU only last week. What I cannot understand is the rush last week to send new regulations under the old legislation, when we know that within a few weeks that legislation will be defunct. The only explanation I can come up with is that the Minister had very little confidence in the support of his backbenchers if there were any further delays. The Minister had at that stage seriously compromised legislation and now he has seriously compromised regulations by changing the legislation which empowered him to make the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">The change in the wording of section 47 is minor, but it is enough to allow an averagely clever lawyer to drive a coach and four through the overall legislation. It is probably a good idea to attempt to justify the smoking ban, and that would be desirable if the Minister had not already rushed to make the regulations last week. The Minister now finds himself in the embarrassing situation of having had to withdraw one set of regulations and now put forward regulations which are seriously compromised. The Minister will have to withdraw them. He may decide not to, but if he wants the legislation to stand, he should do so. I do not know why this point was not addressed in the Minister's speech today or in the explanatory note sent.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The other aspect of the legislation not mentioned by the Minister was the change in penalties. I welcome the change because the notion of sending publicans or others to prison for their failure to enforce legislation which is almost unenforceable by private citizens was totally wrong. Even though the financial penalty has been increased to €3,000, publicans can probably well afford to pay it and would far prefer to do so than go to prison. I regret, however, that while the Minister was changing the legislation he did not take the opportunity to clarify the extent of publicans' responsibilities in enforcing the legislation. I spoke about that when we were discussing the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">In any other area of legislation the Minister would probably have got away with the changes he made, while staying within the EU rulings. In most cases nobody would care sufficiently to make a court challenge, but in this case people will care. There are many billions of euro and dollars at stake, and many people who can out-match the Minister and the State in terms of staying power, lawyers, money and the number of years they can stick with it – believe me, they will stick with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I do not know what the rush was, unless the Minister felt the support of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party was so tenuous that he could not risk any further delay in case that support completely evaporated. Whatever the reason, the handling of the matter has been hugely incompetent and hamfisted. It has given endless material to the hordes of lawyers who will now descend with absolute glee on the mish-mash of current and defunct legislation and regulations with which the Minister has inexplicably provided them. This is all because it has been an ill-considered approach with no "look before you leap" consideration. It failed to regard the crucial detail of the implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I have not mentioned the other example of precipitate action where it was decided to act first and then take legal advice. That was in the area of regulations which were thought sufficient to enable the Health and Safety Authority to enforce the ban. Those regulations had to be withdrawn and are now replaced with legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The Minister has described all these changes of mind and so on as efforts to make the legislation watertight, but he has been undoing mistakes which would have been avoided had there not for some reason been such a rush to push everything ahead and take legal advice after the event. It is more than embarrassing. What we have now is certainly not the watertight legislation the Minister spoke of. It is as leaky as a colander, full of holes which the Government itself has punched in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I ask the Minister to stop doing everything, to take time, hold his horses, look at every aspect of the legislation, try to undo the mistakes made and retrieve the situation to some extent. The time and thought put into the legislation now will repay itself. It may delay the implementation by a couple of weeks or even a couple of months, but that does not really matter when one puts it against the years of delay that could result if it ends up in the courts, which I am convinced it will. As I said, it is a lawyer's dream of loopholes. We could spend ten or 20 years in the courts because the lawyers can outstay us there. We must go in with the confidence that our legislation is robust.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I do not know if it was incompetence, arrogance or sheer bad luck that has turned this into such a fiasco, but I see that the Minister is preparing for a major conference in the mid-west region next year as part of Ireland's Presidency of the EU. That might be a very triumphant event for the Minister, but I doubt it, and if I were him I would not book the hall just yet.</p>

        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_180">I will comment first on the press releases which emerge from the Fianna Fáil press office, because they have been mentioned. It is important to note that there is a continuous practice of issuing inappropriate and vicious attacks from the Fianna Fáil press office in the names of Ministers or chairmen of committees who very often do not appear to know anything about this and are then in the comfortable position of being able to say they were not responsible. That is poor practice. It is time Fianna Fáil as a party began to behave like a serious political party instead of just being vindictive.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">It is extraordinary that we are back here debating this Bill which we previously debated at length. The fact that the Bill is now back in the House is an indication of the Minister's handling of the issue of the smoking ban and other issues to do with smoking. He has adopted an inept approach. It is all the more surprising because his anti-smoking measures are no longer a part of a health strategy; they have in effect become his health strategy. Failure is the hallmark of this Minister for Health and Children when one considers the other areas of health care reform which are crying out for attention and action. The fig leaf of the anti-smoking measures and the ban on smoking is becoming larger and more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">This Bill has already been passed in the House but due to the failure of compliance with proper procedure the House must pass it again. There is still a failure to abide by proper procedure in the manner in which it is being dealt with, quite apart from the court actions and EU requirements. There is ineptitude on the part of the Government in terms of this debate. I refer to the lack of an explanatory memorandum to accompany the Bill. I have been a Member of this House for 11 years but I have never seen this happen before where the House is debating a Bill in this fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The correct procedure for a Minister to follow when introducing legislation in the House is laid down in section 4.22 of the Cabinet handbook:</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Any Bill introduced or presented by or on behalf of a member of the Government, other than a Bill dealing with the Budgetary or Estimates matters, should be accompanied by an Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to explain in simple non-technical language the provisions of the Bill, setting out the existing law and the changes therein proposed by the Bill and providing information about the estimated Exchequer costs and staffing implications for Departments, State bodies, local authorities, etc., unless the promoting Department consider that it is not practicable in the time available or not in the public interest to publish such information. This is a mandatory requirement in the case of Government Bills other than Consolidation Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The Minister can hardly claim that there was insufficient time available to publish an explanatory memorandum. This Bill was published on 19 August 2003. The question is whether the Minister has decided that it is not in the public interest to explain in simple non-technical language the reasons for the introduction of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">This Bill is largely a re-enactment of certain sections of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002. That Act was intended to bring together a range of legal instruments in force and to replace two existing Acts but it was introduced in a defective manner and accordingly the comprehensive, coherent code is now being amended in a piecemeal and almost unintelligible fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The 2002 Act dealt with tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays and sponsorship, registration of retailers and increased penalties for under age sales. It placed a ban on the sale of packets of ten cigarettes and introduced controls on vending machines, imitation sweet cigarettes, disclosure of information relating to toxicity and addiction and protection against passive smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">A wholesale assault on the legislation was mounted by the tobacco manufacturing industry and related trades. In the event the litigation did not proceed to a conclusion since the State had to admit to the High Court that it had in the passing of legislation omitted to comply with the requirements of two European directives. I regard it as quite startling that a procedure agreed with the European Union was simply not complied with. I understand human fallibility but I also understand how Government works and that there is a support system available, including a panoply of legal advisers and the Office of the Attorney General. These supports are to ensure that the wheels of Government run smoothly. It must have been a source of some embarrassment to the Minister that this situation arose.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The transparency and technical standards directives have been in force since 1998. Although the Minister may not have been aware of them, I imagine the contents of these directives are now engraved on his heart. The directives require Government at drafting stage of a Bill to notify the EU Commission in Brussels and other member states of the proposed regulations that could amount to unjustified or disguised barriers to trade within the Single Market. The notification procedure was not followed by the Minister during the Bill Stages of the Act and accordingly 14 of its 53 sections could not be commenced. The only solution to this mess was to go back to square one, hence the Bill the House is now debating which, the House has been informed, has been notified to Brussels. According to a note circulated by the Whips which is the only information available, the three months period following notification will end on 24 November 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">This is a Minister in a hurry. He sets deadlines for himself without reference to process and procedure and then tries to move heaven and earth to ensure compliance. It is not solely a re-enactment of last year's Bill. Certain unexplained amendments have been made to the Act. We are informed these are designed to incorporate various EU and other international measures but we are not told much more. The absence of an explanatory memorandum means that the House and the public at large are entirely in the dark as to what changes are being made and what significance, if any, should be attached to these changes. At the very least, before Committee Stage, a detailed memorandum should be prepared and circulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The Minister's colleagues in Government have complained in recent weeks about his propensity for grabbing the ball and heading off on a solo run. For example, he did not bring his regulations on smoking in the workplace to Government; he thought he could do it better by himself but we all know what happened and the Minister must be still smarting from the resulting debacle. Now he thinks he can call on the Oireachtas to legislate without complying himself with the basic requirement of both procedure and courtesy of informing the House in advance of the sort of legislation he wishes it to enact.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">In my view it is an indication of a fault and a flaw in the Minister and it shows an inability to work fully with others. I believe that is why, for example, he is in such difficulties with the Hanly report. He failed to include his Cabinet colleagues when it came to ensuring that the regulations on anti-smoking measures were watertight and now he is seeking full support across the country for the Hanly report and for a requirement on local communities and their public representatives to accept very serious downgrading and withdrawal of services. It should not be too surprising that the Minister is feeling rather exposed at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The House is dealing with the primary legislation as the regulations have gone to the EU. I am not sure if Deputy Olivia Mitchell's point is a strong one in legal terms but it certainly requires attention. I hope the Minister will make a response on the difficulty that may arise as a result of this extraordinary back to front approach which he has adopted. Primary and secondary legislation work in sequence. Secondary legislation flows from primary legislation but in this case it is not working that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I note that the pattern all the way through has been disappointingly inept and inadequate. The House debated the anti-smoking regulations and then it was discovered that the regulations were to be amended further. We knew they were to be amended in terms of prisons but we did not know what the amendments would be. In the course of that debate the Minister referred us to the EU website if we wished to find out about his amendment regarding prisons. We had nothing on paper in front of us and have only now received copies of the amendments made.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">It is gross discourtesy and it reflects a lack of professionalism in how the Government deals with parliamentary procedure. Nice words from the Minister about the Opposition are meaningless when such carelessness exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">That sloppiness is an indicator that there are dangers ahead. Carelessness can lead to legal challenges by powerful interests that have a lot of money for legal advice. I hope they will not succeed but that is the irony of the situation. It is rare for a Minister for Health and Children to be able to depend on the Opposition to support him but that is the current position. He has not been able to depend on the support of Government Members as much as on the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">It does not do much for one's confidence to find that there has been a series of mistakes, omissions and conflicting regulations causing contradictions between health and safety regulations and the Minister's regulations. The Taoiseach now tells me that the health and safety regulations have been quietly dropped and that we will see the preparation of primary legislation to deal with them. It is a sorry mess and I say that with no joy. Such a mish-mash approach on an issue which will be fought tooth and nail does not reflect well on this House or this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">There are vested interests who promote sickness and death, merchants of cancer and cardiac conditions who make money from people's ill health and who will not give up if they see any opportunity to frustrate this. I am concerned that even in today's debate, we find unacceptable opportunities are being offered to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">It is also unacceptable that Cabinet procedure for all Ministers was not complied with in this instance. That makes it difficult for the Opposition to do its job, but this was done without any explanation except that the Minister has an attachment to making solo runs – we must accept that he knows best. That is not a good way for a Parliament to function and I regret that. I hope the requirements to ban smoking in the workplace will work but my confidence has been dented by the Minister's track record so far.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_200">I welcome this legislation that transposes an EU directive into Irish law and welcome the fact that we are not dragging our heels as we have done in the past on EU directives. In this case we are doing so promptly and we also trying to close some of the loopholes in previous legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Credit is due to the EU on this matter. Former EU Commissioner Flynn and Commissioner Byrne did a good job in this area. Great work was also done by ASH and Dr. Luke Clancy, who did much to raise the problems caused by smoking and was often a lone voice in the early days.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">In a previous debate on the anti-smoking regulations, some colleagues in the Technical Group said this was an example of the nanny state. It is important, however, to remember that we are talking about a matter of individual choice. In a liberal society the individual can choose how to behave and conduct his or her life. If a person chooses to smoke, that is fine. If he wants to damage his body, that is his choice. Personally, I think it is a nonsensical habit. I do not understand why someone would want to suck poison into their lungs but that is his or her choice.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_204">It becomes an addiction once the choice is made. The problem is how people who are addicted to nicotine affect other people. They have the right to damage themselves but not to damage other people. It is not a question of the nanny state; the State has a duty to protect its citizens. I do not accept that people have the right to impose their habits on others. The compromise solution of artificially dividing pubs and restaurants does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">This legislation does not just transpose EU legislation, it looks at previous loopholes. It is a rush job and I regret to say the Minister may be rapidly using up the good will of the Opposition. He has behaved like a gadfly, rushing here and there. I am sure his primary motivation is to protect public health but political considerations were undoubtedly involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">It is not an easy job being the Minister for Health and Children but this provided a diversion over the summer. We did not hear about really important issues in the health service because we were consumed by the debate on the smoking ban. It was all the Minister discussed. He knew this was a popular measure and, although a vocal minority opposed to it, the vast majority of people supported it. It was perfect. The approach, however, was ham fisted and it is astounding that he did not foresee the difficulties and that legal challenges would be mounted. That was inevitable and the Minister should recognise that another legal challenge will probably follow once we have dealt with this again.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The Minister and his officials must be extremely careful and we must go through this in detail on Committee Stage. Like Deputy McManus, I regret that there was no memorandum on this. I thought it was an oversight but that is how business was done. I also regret that during our debate on the anti-smoking regulations, we were not informed in advance about the difficulties that lay ahead. I felt cheated because we were fulsome in our praise of the Minister while not knowing about these problems. I was astounded to hear the Minister say in his contribution that certain procedures were not followed and that, as a result, 14 of the 53 sections of the Act were affected. He said that as the Act is a public health measure, it was considered originally that it was not notifiable to the Commission as a technical regulation. "It was not considered" involves the use of the passive voice. Who talked about this? Did the Minister speak personally to his officials about it and did he go through it in detail? Will he explain to the House how he came to this conclusion?</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The Minister further stated that it was also considered that the requirement to introduce commencement orders in the case of the Act would allow for notification of the commencement order in draft form, thereby meeting the requirements of the transparency directives. Was that discussed in detail or did the Minister leave it to his officials? Did he talk to them about this matter? The Minister went on to say that following correspondence and discussion with the EU Commission officials on this matter and having obtained legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it became clear that any attempt to commence the affected sections would result in considerable uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Unfortunately, I have never been in Government. I hope to get the opportunity at some stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_212">I thank Deputy Connaughton. I am glad he has that confidence. It strikes me as very strange that someone did not pick up the phone in advance and speak to the Commission about this. Did it not strike someone that this is an area to be discussed with their colleagues in the Commission? Why was that not done in advance? Clearly it was not done because the Minister was rushing to get this legislation out.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I spoke earlier about the internal political considerations. I have said this previously but perhaps this was a case of putting it up to some people in the Cabinet. The Minister vehemently denies that but I believe it was a nice way of saying to the Taoiseach, someone who always sits on the fence, that he either accepts this or he does not. I do not know what goes on internally in Fianna Fáil but I suspect it is not dissimilar to other parties in which political struggles, etc. take place. There may have been an element of that in this case, albeit an important one, and the consequence is that these struggles within Fianna Fáil have resulted in botched legislation. That is why we are looking at it today.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Let us examine possible problems with the legislation. Previous speakers did not allude directly to the legislation but only yesterday the people who operate vending machines and who have a vested interest told us that herbal cigarettes are permissible. I have no doubt they will stage another stunt in the future which will involve all these people going into a pub or a restaurant, lighting up these herbal cigarettes and stinking the place out. I do not know how the Minister will react to that but it will make a nonsense of the legislation. Can anyone do anything about that? These people are saying that under the legislation nothing can be done but the assembled wreckers out there will try everything by way of stunt and legal challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">One of the sections deals with selling confectionery to children. That is justifiable if it is felt that this is a gateway to children becoming addicted to nicotine in later life. When we were children we used to get liquorice pipes. I assume that is the type of product referred to in the Bill. I have no objection but there may be a loophole in terms of packaging, which is referred to in the Bill. I do not know if the Minister is aware of this but on the Continent many shops selling cigarettes provide customers with a cardboard package that can be put around the cigarette pack, which blocks off the health warning. It has a slogan such as "Smoking is Cool," in other words, a directly contrary message to that contained in the health warning.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I have read the legislation and I do not believe this eventuality is covered. The Minister needs to include some sort of provision and I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that someone cannot pay an extra 25 cent for a little package to put around the packet of cigarettes. Apparently, these are all the rage in France, Spain and elsewhere and it is something the Minister should consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I refer to another area I discussed in detail in the health committee. As the Minister knows, we did a lot of work on this and Deputy Keaveney referred to our visit to the United States, etc. It involves the advocacy of smoking in the area of film and the media. We can ban advertising, which I would support fully, but there is no more potent an advertisement for smoking than to see a film star smoking in a film or on television. The figures show that the prevalence of smoking on television has increased, particularly on the soaps. In some cases it involves brand placement like Marlboro, Camel or whatever, but in others it is simply the idea of smoking as such. This is a difficult area because we are dealing with cultural matters. We import many films from Hollywood, etc. but some sort of agreement has to be reached if someone intends to promote smoking in his film or on television. A show that comes to mind here is "Bachelor's Walk", which is very popular. Every one of the men in that show smokes; they are always smoking. It is cool.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">We all supported the ban on advertising but in between the advertising slots smoking is being promoted. How can we deal with that? I do not think we can interfere with artistic licence in any way but there should be a charge, which would go into the fund to promote anti-smoking, if people intend to promote smoking in that way. Something along those lines has to be tried. I realise that may be difficult but perhaps the Minister could comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">This is a very worthwhile initiative. The Minister has the support of the House but we need to look at air quality in general. If people are being affected by passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke, they are most certainly being affected by exhaust fumes from cars throughout this city. Studies have shown that the number of children with asthma is on the increase. We know that passive smoking increases a child's chance of developing asthma but we also know that the emissions from our cars are having a huge effect on mortality rates. According to statistics from Switzerland, three times as many people are dying from the effect of exhaust fumes as are dying in traffic accidents.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">It was a study done in Switzerland. I take it that it holds true for here as well. When we consider the sort of pollutants being emitted – volatile organic compounds, PM10s, particulates, carbon monoxide, etc. – that type of chemical cocktail puts environmental tobacco smoke in the shade. When we walk out of here that is what we are breathing in. The Minister and other EU Ministers must consider that. The sooner we move to low or zero emission cars the better for people's health and for global warming. We know that the nitrogen oxide emitted affects morbidity and mortality, but because many people use cars, which are convenient, it is put to one side. However, it affects people's health and the Minister should be extremely concerned about that. We are putting our heads in the sand if we deal with smoking but pretend that car emissions are not a problem. Will the Minister and his officials examine this and make suggestions? I know we have discussed car free days, but stringent controls must be introduced and we should not wait for the EU to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">I welcome the Bill. I will table amendments on Committee Stage when I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss the legislation in detail. The last thing we need is for someone to successfully challenge the Bill. That would be a black day for the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">In the absence of an explanatory memorandum, it is extremely difficult to address the Bill comprehensively. The Minister's involved explanation of the technical reasons for the introduction of the Bill underscores that point. I highlight that deficiency which must be dealt with. I regard the legislation as positive and the Sinn Féin Deputies will support its passage.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The Bill implements EU directives on the manufacture, presentation, sale, advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products. It also cites the World Health Organisation's framework convention on tobacco control signed in Geneva in May of this year. Restrictions on tobacco are nothing new. They have proven successful in helping to reduce consumption of tobacco products in Ireland. The further restrictions in the Bill are part of the EU-wide effort along the same lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">As I stated in the Dáil during the debate on the smoking ban proposals for the workplace, I trust that the passage of the Bill will help to accelerate social change and existing social trends away from smoking. The Minister might recall that I said I did not see enforceability of the workforce ban as a major problem as I expected that, in time and over a shorter period than people might imagine, the social unacceptability of smoking in the workplace would become apparent and more people would uphold it.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">However, enforceability under this legislation is more problematic as it covers a range of commercial practices carried out in a wide range of contexts and premises. Like Deputy Gormley and I am sure the Minister, I could cite all types of experiences from my childhood. I hope these difficulties and the challenges the Bill will present in terms of enforceability have been taken on board by the Minister and his Department. I wish him success with the implementation of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">As I have already indicated, I welcome the Bill just as I welcomed the ban on smoking in the workplace. The Minister must be commended on bringing forward these measures. They are important for the rights of workers in the workplace and for public health.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">It is regrettable that there seems to have been a failure of collective leadership on this issue within the Government. It appears the issue was delayed in coming to the Cabinet and that the knock-on effect is the implementation of the new regulations later than was originally intended. It is another indication of the lack of cohesion and co-ordination in the Government. This was exemplified on a number of occasions recently. Ministers who operate their Departments as independent fiefdoms demonstrate these difficulties most.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">At times Cabinet collectivity or collegiality seems to be at sixes and sevens. We see it in the approach to the Hanly report and the contradictory messages from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, about rent supplement and whether it is a housing measure, and from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs who takes the view that it is not. Contradictory statements were issued by a Minister and a Minister of State within a three day period, something I mentioned to the Taoiseach during the week. We have seen the same contradictions about the smoking ban. It is little wonder that the last vestiges of confidence in the Government are ebbing away with this track record.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">It is well known that the existing laws banning the sale of alcohol and tobacco to persons under the age of 18 are being widely flouted. We must accept that fact. There is little evidence that these matters are being seriously addressed. Any cursory examination of court reports does not show a significant throughput of prosecutions for the illegal sale of such products to under age children. Further restrictions on advertising will not address this problem. We need to hear from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about what further measures will be taken to combat the continuing targeting of young people in the sale of alcohol and tobacco products. We need to see a proactive and targeted approach to this issue. Perhaps the Minister could explain in his reply what measures he expects his colleague in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to implement to address not only this deficiency but also this major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">An argument repeatedly raised by the tobacco industry is the employment the industry creates, including in Ireland. While that argument is rightly refuted by citing the huge cost in terms of human health and the economic cost to the overall Exchequer in terms of the damage done to the health both of smokers and people subjected to smoke through passive smoking, there is an issue we cannot ignore. There is no point in depending solely on the refutation of the arguments presented by the tobacco industry. That will be no solace whatsoever to people who are working in the industry and are rightly concerned for their future employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The Government and the tobacco industry have an obligation to plan for the conversion of the industry and secure alternative employment opportunities for those employed within it. I am not speaking only of those within the remaining manufacturing and distribution sectors – there are many people employed in servicing vending machines and so on, and they will have to be taken into consideration. I do not think it is intended, while pursuing the common good, that we will see a significant body of people lose their livelihoods without anything being done by the Government, and those in the House, on their behalf. We have a collective responsibility to address this problem and I hope the Minister and his colleagues will provide the lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">We might all be better off if the tobacco industry were to shut down completely, but that is an unlikely scenario. The indications are that more people globally are smoking today than at any time in the past. That is a fact. We already know that poorer people suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related diseases and have a greater dependency on tobacco than their higher-income counterparts. That is true in Ireland and on a world scale. However, it is not just a matter of pointing at people on lower incomes here. We must also consider that poorer countries are clearly showing an increase in the use of tobacco products compared to more developed countries such as Ireland, which is allegedly among the five wealthiest nations on the globe. That is an interesting assertion – there are many in my constituency who would find it hard to credit, and many more outside the gates of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">While we have seen a reduction in smoking in Ireland, there has been unquestionably a marked increase in smoking in other countries, particularly underdeveloped ones. Clearly, therefore, the prospect of the tobacco industry going into permanent decline is unlikely. Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former director general of the World Health Organisation, has stated that more people smoke today than at any time in human history. He made the keen observation that one person dies every ten seconds from smoking-related diseases.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I commend the Minister on these initiatives. They have not been easy to argue at a range of levels, including within my constituency. I made a submission to the Minister about the most recent measures, seeking address of certain problems, and I acknowledge the Minister has accepted the greater number of my recommendations, with one glaring exception. However, we will have to live with that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_240">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I spoke on the Bill we introduced last year and it is nice to see a certain maturity in the debate, which lacks the divisiveness that usually enters into other discussions. I have listened to the contributions made so far, particularly the Minister's explanation of the need for the Bill. We are all aware of the tremendous amounts of money available to the tobacco industry – it is no surprise that it has commenced legal challenges to last year's Public Health (Tobacco) Act. During those judicial hearings it became obvious that we had not fulfilled our obligations to Europe and this resulted in the Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Some Members have been critical of the way the Minister has handled things and the reason we are discussing the Bill, but we will leave that aside – we should not lose our focus on the bigger picture. For most people, that is the move by the Minister to regulate smoking in the workplace. That was his intention from the start and it has not changed. The Minister indicated soon after taking office that one of his main priorities was the war against tobacco, and that has remained a priority of the Government. I am delighted to see such support for his policy on all sides of the House. This must be welcomed. It is a tough battle against a wealthy industry which will do anything to protect its market.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">A number of Members have mentioned that they warned the Minister about potential legal challenges, but we should not be unnecessarily worried about that – it should not come as a great surprise that the tobacco industry continues to use the courts to try to hold on to what it has. However, we were elected to the House and we should do what we think is right. I have no doubt that the measures being taken by the Minister are in our best interests and will have enormous benefits for us for many years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">A previous Minister for Health, Mr. Charles Haughey, was responsible for introducing the health warnings on packets of cigarettes. I am not sure what impact this has had on smokers as one must purchase the packet to see the warning. However, it was the start of a change in attitude towards smoking. What was acceptable up to a few years ago has now become socially unacceptable in many places. In offices, homes, cars and all other areas where people gather, people are reluctant to light up and are certainly more conscious of the rights of other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Bill the Minister introduced last year was the toughest anti-tobacco legislation ever seen in this country and, probably, throughout Europe. The main provisions consisted of a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, the registration of tobacco retailers and increased penalties for selling tobacco products to those who are under age. There was also a ban on retail sales of packets of fewer than 20 cigarettes and on the sale of sweets and confectionery that resemble tobacco products. There was improved protection against passive smoking and the Minister was provided with the right to designate places where smoking could be banned.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">People felt that the ban on tobacco advertising would have a negative effect on a number of sporting activities, particularly the Irish Masters Snooker Championship, which took place for many years in Goffs and more recently in Citywest. At that time, the Minister stepped in and the Department sponsored the tournament. It is good to see that the tournament has managed to survive without the support of the tobacco industry. It is a good indication that sport – and life – can continue in Ireland without the so-called support of the tobacco industry. While we often underestimate the effect advertising has, the industry would not spend such huge resources on advertising if it did not get results.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Last year's Act designated certain areas where smoking would be banned and the main area we have been made aware of is the public house. There has been a major campaign throughout the country to have this changed. It is only natural that publicans would express concern about the Minister's move, as they want to protect an investment they have made. They are concerned this move will mean a serious reduction in the turnover of their businesses and comparisons were drawn with what happened in other countries. I have no doubt that the majority of people support the move the Minister is making. Even smokers are aware of the damage they are doing, not just to themselves but also to the people around them. It will require a change in the habits of a lifetime for some people. Having a drink and a smoke went together for many people and this is something that will now have to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">People have asked how this will be enforced. Who enforced the change when smoking was banned in cinemas, aeroplanes or in other public places? It does not take much enforcing; the majority of our citizens are law-abiding. If the Government decides to introduce new laws, the vast majority of people will support them and try to live within them. I am sure publicans will be responsible in this area. Getting rid of ashtrays is the first thing publicans will do when this change comes in. Few publicans would tolerate ashes being discarded on the floors of their premises. While I do not think this will create the difficulties some people have anticipated, it is important the publicans play their part in enforcing this and ensuring it is successful. This is not being done for the sake of upsetting publicans or reducing the value of their businesses. It is hoped that it will reduce the consumption of tobacco and will provide a better quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">In itself, the ban will reduce the amount of smoking in the country. However, we must also look at other methods that will reduce the incidence of smoking. In the past, the only tool Governments used to do this was to increase the price of cigarettes on budget day. It was felt that if the price was sufficiently increased it would provide people with an incentive to give up cigarettes. Other people that have given up smoking started by doing so for religious reasons by giving them up for Lent. Smoking is an addiction and people become addicted after a short exposure to it. For this reason, I have particular sympathy for elderly people on low incomes who find themselves addicted to a product. Each week they will find themselves paying out a huge percentage of their income on cigarettes. The Government has increased the price of cigarettes in recent budgets and has diverted part of the funds raised into the area of health. No matter what sort of campaign is conducted, it will be difficult to persuade elderly people to change their lifetime habits.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">It is important that the Government encourages a healthy lifestyle. The Minister outlined that approximately 7,000 people die each year in this country as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. Approximately 20 people are dying each day from tobacco-related illnesses. The Minister for Transport is to be commended for his campaign to reduce fatalities and accidents on our roads. However, the number of people being killed on our roads is quite small in comparison to the number dying from tobacco-related illnesses. A minor improvement in the war against tobacco would have an even greater return than those we have seen arising from the measures the Minister for Transport has taken. I am supportive of those measures and it is nice to see the success we are having in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">A reduction of the amount of tobacco being sold and consumed in this country must be a priority of any Minister. It will have huge benefits. It will increase life expectancy, we will have a healthier nature and resources and funds will be freed up in our health services. I do not know if the Minister has figures that indicate the number of beds occupied by people suffering from tobacco-related illnesses. If 7,000 people are dying each year, there must be many more people in hospital suffering from tobacco-related illnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">It is important that we continue with our programme of providing greater sporting facilities throughout the country, particularly in schools. If people can be encouraged to participate in sporting activities we will reap the rewards in the long-term. Many studies have shown that if children can be encouraged to take up a healthy and sporting lifestyle at a young age, the chances are that they will stick with it. Most sports people do not see cigarettes going hand in hand with sport. Considerable resources have been provided for sporting facilities countrywide. However, many primary and secondary schools have poor facilities and it is important that we would try to rectify this.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The Minister mentioned our forthcoming Presidency of the EU and how he intends holding a major conference on this issue and that the rest of the world was looking to the EU to initiate strong measures in this vital area of public health. By introducing this legislation we will have shown our colleagues in Europe that we mean business. We will have a degree of credibility and when we assume the Presidency we will speak on the issue with some authority. I wish the Minister well with his conference and I hope a number of our colleagues in the EU will follow suit and implement similar measures to ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The Minister reminded the House that smoking remains the biggest cause of preventable death in the European Union. It follows that it is also the biggest cause of preventable death in this country. Many campaigns have discouraged young people from beginning to smoke. We must also campaign vigorously to encourage people who have started to smoke to give up the habit before they become addicted. We should work harder to explain the results of tobacco smoking. We have seen the effects of anti-drink driving campaigns which show graphic pictures on television. A similar campaign against tobacco would pay dividends. While we discourage young people from smoking, the effects of smoking on health are not always obvious. I encourage the Minister to look at that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Some years ago I listened to a debate on this subject in the House of Commons and, for the first time, took notice of the tobacco industry and the need for major change in this country. A speaker made the point that the tobacco industry has huge resources at its disposal for campaigns directed at young people. He pointed out that there were two reasons for directing sexy campaigns at young people, first, if young people took up the habit of smoking they would be hooked for life and, second, the industry's customers were dying and had to be replaced. Smoking advertising campaigns may be sexy and attractive and aimed at young people but the reality is that customers are dying and new people must be found to replace them if the tobacco manufacturers are to continue in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I commend the Minister and other Members of the House for the responsible manner in which they have dealt with this subject. There was a certain reluctance on the part of some people to accept the necessity for this change. It will mean a serious change in the habits of a lifetime for many people throughout the country but it is in the best interest of the nation's health. I commend the Minister for Health and Children for the way he has dealt with this issue. When the ban on smoking in the workplace is implemented next year I hope people, particularly publicans, will deal with it in a mature fashion and realise their responsibilities, not only to themselves but to their customers and workers. The ban will protect the health of people in the workplace and it is important we recognise that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_256">I have always been an advocate of the smoking ban and I have said so publicly. I had a number of reservations about the measure when it was introduced and thought some aspects could have been dealt with slightly differently but I support the basic principle of the ban. It is hard not to be in favour of it when one sees the statistics on the effects of smoking. Worse than that is the number of our friends who have died prematurely in many cases, as a result of cancer, heart attacks and strokes which were caused by smoking. One would not need to be a professor or a doctor of medicine to understand the underlying reasons for those illnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Irrespective of what we think of the measure in its entirety, the Bill is an attempt to streamline a botched effort. Given the resources of the Department of Health and Children, the Minister, the Ministers of State, the Attorney General and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the entire machinery of Government, on an issue that has been such a part of Irish life for the past 12 months, I cannot understand how such a fundamental difficulty as this could not have been foreseen. I am neither a solicitor nor a parliamentary draftsman, and I do not know who advised the Minister and the Ministers of State – I assume it was the Attorney General – but it beats me how the Minister could have got this so wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">We saw a high profile campaign on this issue which is now beginning to wane. Heretofore, one would have assumed that the Government was extremely sensitive to what was going on because half the members of the Government parties were speaking out of one side of their mouths in the House and saying they were in favour of the ban while in their constituencies they were running around with everyone who was against it. Testament to this is the acres of space given to the issue in the local papers and on radio. There was not a day of the week when a Minister or Minister of State was not on the radio finding fault with the substantive issue. A hurler on the ditch who did not have a view one way or the other would say the Government was divided.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The Government will ride out this crisis because the majority of people who think about these matters are in favour of a ban on smoking in the workplace. The reaction to the Hanly report, however, will be a different kettle of fish. That is where we will see the real divisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I wonder if diversionary tactics are being employed. There was no shortage of smokescreens in the past six or eight months while this issue was being discussed. The Government knows – the Government parties go to great lengths to find out how the public think on every issue – that the majority of the public support the ban on smoking, as I always thought they would. I never smoked a cigarette in my life although, like all my colleagues, I spend a great deal of my time in the company of people who do. This has never been an issue for me. If it were I would not be able to do my job because I spend half my time in public houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I do not think any Government would not know that this legislation was necessary, or that it would forget to do what we are trying to do today. I will say what I think was wrong. There was a time when opposition to this measure was so strong, particularly in the Fianna Fáil Party, that the Government was afraid the numbers might not stack up. I refer to the time when the publicans' campaign was reaching its peak. The Government decided that it should sign the regulations into law and take its chances thereafter. I cannot come to any other reasonable assumption. I cannot be convinced that the Attorney General, the Minister, the Minister of State and the senior officials in the Department did not know that this Bill was necessary. It beggars belief that they did not anticipate the need for additional legislation. The professional expertise available to the Government is usually of a very high standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">When the jitters arrived some months ago, the Minister thought, between the jigs and the reels, that his best option was to sign the regulation into law and to take a chance thereafter. He took a chance on whether the people would agree with him. This is vividly demonstrated by the fact that I have not heard anybody speaking against the ban today. Certain Deputies expressed their opposition to the ban in local newspapers when it was first proposed, but they have not made similar statements in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The last time I spoke on this subject I mentioned that I believe the ban on smoking in public houses should be introduced gradually. I know that will not happen at this stage, so I will not waste the time of the House talking about it to any great extent. Perhaps a gradual ban was not practical, but it seemed sensible at the time. When discussing matters of this nature, one has to revert to one's own experience. This is particularly true if one represents a rural constituency, as I do. Many parishes in my constituency have just one or two pubs. There is almost no social alternative in such areas. If one does not go to the pub, one will have nowhere to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Publicans were right to highlight their grievances, as many of them will face great organisational problems. When I was in a pub recently – it is the only one in the parish in question – I noticed that younger and older people were mixed together because there is nowhere else for them to go. In larger towns and cities, it tends to be the case that there are certain places for young people and other places for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">As Deputy Seán Power mentioned, the smoking ban will be extremely difficult to get used to. This will be particularly true for older people who have spent 30 or 40 years in the same routine of smoking a cigarette when they go for a drink in a pub. They will find it extraordinarily difficult not to smoke, or to go outside the door if they wish to do so. We have gone past that stage now, however, for better or for worse. The legislation before the House will have to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Many people have spoken to me about their belief that the ban will not be enforceable. I do not think it will be long before there is a public outcry against smoking in places where it is banned. When I take the train, as I do frequently, I notice that if somebody lights a cigarette in the non-smoking carriages, another person – not the ticket collector – will ask them to put it out within ten seconds. There will be a rapid cultural change as a result of this measure. We will welcome it when it takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I do not have a problem with the fact that the Minister for Health and Children decided not to impose a ban on smoking in hotel rooms. It would have been very hard to enforce if there was nobody other than the smoker in the room. It is unlikely that the proprietor of the hotel would know what was going on, unless there was a garda walking up and down the corridor.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I do not have a problem with this measure as it relates to psychiatric hospitals and jails. A warden may wonder why his or her health is being put at risk when the health of a bartender is being protected. It is a difficult question, but common sense has to be take into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The last time we debated this matter, I said that the proposed maximum penalties for publicans were extreme. A jail sentence was involved, as I recall, but I cannot remember what the upper limit was. Has the Government dropped the threat of a jail sentence? I have not heard too much about it. Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether this is so. It has been suggested to me that the threat of a jail sentence is no longer provided for in this Bill. Given that I said some months ago that such a penalty would be extremely harsh, I am very interested to know if a change has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I chaired a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children about three or four years ago, when I was the vice-chairman of the committee. We had requested the attendance of certain representatives of the tobacco industry, who gave a presentation. I realised for the first time during the meeting that the tobacco companies have an extreme level of power. I will not waste the time of the House by saying something that has been said many times before, but I will make a point that is important for the future. The proposed smoking ban represents a major step on a very long road. The representatives of the tobacco industry, together with their advisers and public relations personnel, spent three hours trying to convince the committee that nicotine is not addictive. They made the most remarkable case one could encounter to defend their central theme. They did not wish to say anything else. They cited research which they claimed proved their case. They argued that as people die off, fewer people are taking up smoking. I do not know how one could relate the two issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">It is important that we make a certain point about the image of smoking. Research vividly demonstrates that young women start smoking at an earlier age, for whatever reason, and that they continue to do so. It is remarkable to note, when one goes to various functions where young people are present, that a huge number of young girls smoke. If this trend develops without being controlled in some way, we will have another generation of smokers. I do not know what can be done to reverse the trend, as we seem to have tried everything. If we took the warnings on packets of cigarettes literally, we would throw them into the river immediately. It is obvious that those who purchase cigarettes take no notice of the warnings on the packets. There will have to be huge educational programmes. Another Bill may be necessary to limit the availability of cigarettes.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I am not sure that the Bill before the House, when taken with the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, will mean that fewer people smoke. There will be a dramatic difference in the area of passive smoking. At least someone at work or in a bar or wherever will not have to put up with someone else's smoke. That will be good. I do not know what people will do when they go outside the pub, whether they will go out onto the footpath in between drinks or whatever, and I am not sure if anyone knows at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I do not know whether there will be a significant reduction in the volume of smoking. However, one would have to support a Government that tries to change the terrible statistic of more than 7,000 smoking-related deaths annually. The problem exists in every parish or home and connects to each of us in some way. It behoves us as legislators to do whatever we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I sincerely hope that there will be no more messing with the legislation and that it will not be manna from heaven for senior counsel and other barristers. I hope they will not see so many crucial inaccuracies or loopholes in the legislation that there will be a court case on it every day. Given the muscle and professionalism of the tobacco industry, it is important that we have the best legal advice and that whatever legislation we introduce is constitutional and stands up in court. The tobacco industry worldwide is working overtime to fight back against what it sees as an attack on it. As they say in my part of the country, we would want all our hair on to ensure that we are able to compete with the industry at every level.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_275">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on addressing the fatal scourge of smoking and prohibiting smoking in the workplace. The point of this prohibition has been lost in many of the arguments against this move. Some 7,500 people die every year as a result of smoking-related diseases. That is the real problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">In a choice between saving lives and profits, we must choose lives every time. The public and workplace employees are increasingly aware of the threat to their health from toxic tobacco smoke and of the necessity of the measures being introduced to protect them. It is also important to point out that this initiative is based on emphatic advice from health experts. There is consensus within the international scientific community and the World Health Organisation about the damaging effects of tobacco smoke and that there is no safe level of exposure to this known carcinogen.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">It has been suggested that designated smoking areas should be allowed as a compromise. This ignores the fact that staff would still be required to work in such areas. Furthermore, tobacco smoke is not stagnant. It permeates the entire atmosphere of a room regardless of where the smoking takes place and without regard to areas designated as smoking or non-smoking. This is not a realistic or acceptable option.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">It has been suggested that improvements in ventilation technology can deal with the problem of second hand smoke. On 30 January, a report entitled The Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace was published by the Health and Safety Authority and the Office of Tobacco Control. This research, which included an examination of international research, was drawn up by an independent group of scientists, including specialists in toxicology, epidemiology, occupational medical services and public health medicine, as well as a radiational aerosol physicist. This group of scientists concluded that there is consensus among the international scientific community that environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace increases the risk of lung cancer by between 20% and 30% and that involuntary smoking increases the risk of heart disease in non-smokers by between 25% and 30%.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">In particular, the group drew attention to the decision in 2002 of the International Agency for Cancer Research of the World Health Organisation which declared that environmental tobacco smoke is a known carcinogen. The research shows that ventilation technologies are inadequate to give workers full protection from the hazards of tobacco smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the US and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists have concluded that even proposed new technologies such as displacement ventilation systems, which may reduce ETS exposure levels by up to 90%, would still leave exposure levels which are 1,500 to 2,000 times above the acceptable risk level for hazardous air pollutants. The expert group concluded that a smoking ban remains the only viable control measure to ensure that workers and patrons are protected from exposure to the by-products of tobacco combustion.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">It is important to bear in mind that the majority of people – more than 70% – do not smoke. If the same level of discussion and effort being applied to seeking out loopholes in the legislation was instead focused on promoting the improved environment which workers and the public can look forward to next year, those now voicing their concerns would be able to look forward to an opportunity to improve their business work environment substantially. We only have to look at what happened in the film industry and cinemas since smoking was banned. The film industry has boomed since.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The fact that the majority of people will benefit is the basis on which to plan for the future. I agree with Deputy Connaughton that peer pressure is probably the best way of policing this legislation. I have also noticed that many people who now try to smoke in areas designated as non-smoking are prohibited by their peers. People do not want to be exposed to the effects of tobacco smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Only yesterday, the respiratory consultants backed the proposed ban on workplace smoking saying that it would save many people from a debilitating and killer disease. The Irish Thoracic Society annual conference passed a motion urging all politicians, employers and the public to support the move. Their support coincides with world chronic obstructive pulmonary disease awareness day. COPD symptoms range from coughing and sputum production to shortness of breath. Amazingly, it affects well over 110,000 people in this country and accounts for nearly 10,000 hospital bed days a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Anyone who has seen people who suffer from COPD will know what I am talking about. It is in many ways the most awful lung disease, and I have seen patients who suffered from this condition imploring people to shorten their lives such were the ill effects they were suffering at the time. That conference also heard World Health Organisation statistics which showed that Ireland has the second highest COPD mortality rate of 28 industrial nations. One place behind us is Hungary. This is a frightening statistic for a nation such as ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Vested interests may continue to try to divert the debate on the ban away from the core issue of health, but there is no arguing with the fact, highlighted by the lung experts, that tobacco smoking is one of the major risk factors for death and disability in this country. A recent report from the Office of Tobacco Control indicates that the cost of smoking to the State amounts to €5 million per day. Not only will this ban save lives, it will also save our economy money which we can then invest in other areas of health. It is just not right to expose workers to a carcinogen that is as dangerous as asbestos.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I welcome the Minister's courageous and relentless determination to save the lives of those workers. However, I recognise that we live in the real world. We cannot expect to impose the ban in places where people live. That includes not only private homes, but also prisons, psychiatric hospitals, hospices and sleeping accommodation in hotels and guest houses. I understand that exemptions must be made in those areas because they make sense. However, any other exemptions would be totally unacceptable. I welcome the Bill to the House and support the Minister in his unyielding efforts to save the lives of workers nationwide.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_287">I too welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this important legislation. I must brave asking the question of why it is coming in now. It is extremely worrying that the whole idea of a smoking ban should be taken so far – we were literally told that it would come into force on 1 January 2004 – only for us to find that legislation must be introduced. Where did the advice come from, and how did we get it so wrong? Are we absolutely certain that, when this legislation has been passed, the great power of the tobacco and certain other industries will not be able to drive a coach and four through it and cause all sorts of problems, both financial and other? Legal people are waiting, and I am not one to provide answers in the face of such a body of learned people. However, as a layman and legislator, I am worried that there is room for that in the legislation, since we got it so badly wrong before.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">There has been much talk about the smoking ban and whether it is right. A stream of people have emerged from the Government backbenches, and even some Ministers, saying it was wrong and that there was no need for it. I hope they will come into the Chamber now and say what they said to their own publicans and friends in the business. We should not be two-faced about such things. We should either do what we say we are prepared to do or else not say anything. I thought that I had lost a brother through nicotine poisoning, but it turned out to have been asbestos poisoning. That was proved clearly by the coroner after his death. Like most families, I have some personal experience of serious respiratory illness and knowledge of the causes. Others have raised such issues as the effect of car fumes, but the companies themselves admit on the packet that smoking kills. It is not that long ago that I was at a small meeting with four or five people discussing some other things that they considered very dangerous but for which there was no proof. However, of the five of us sitting round that table, three of them had packets sitting out in front of them with the sign "Smoking kills". To put it bluntly, they had no respect for the fact that the other three of us sitting round the table were also inhaling their smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">One story was told to me only a few days ago. A now retired man advised me that, a few weeks earlier, for the purely political reason of embarrassing the Government, he would have told me to oppose the smoking ban. He comes from a staunch Fine Gael background. However, he had been to see his specialist, whom he told that he had not smoked in 40 years. The specialist said that he was his friend and that there was no point in trying to tell him that he had not smoked in 40 years. He said that he was no fool when it came to that business. The man said that he was telling him the truth and that he had not smoked for 40 years. The specialist asked him what sort of job he had been in. He told him that he had been an hotelier and a publican. The specialist said that that explained the state of the man's system now, a clear indication that he was suffering directly from having inhaled other people's smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">For that reason and others, I am not against the smoking ban, and I wish to make that absolutely clear. However, I am worried at the way it is being brought in, because I come from a Border region where there are problems with how one implements such a ban. I wonder why there was not debate or discussion. We in this House – and especially the main party of Government, Fianna Fáil – project ourselves as having structured liaison with Northern Ireland. Here was a golden opportunity to introduce the ban on an all-island basis and avoid the creation of a new Border which most of us want done away with. I remember the time when we had to get our car – or in our case, my late father's van – signed for by someone in Northern Ireland and stamped through on each occasion. I saw the Border move from that to its present openness. A new structure is being put in place, and I would not mind if it were put in place after some effort had been made to reach agreement with Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Something is absolutely clear from questions which I tabled to the Minister and sent to the Northern Ireland Office at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. The question which I asked was fairly simple. I asked what plans the Northern Ireland Secretary, Paul Murphy, had to introduce a smoking ban for the hotel and pub industry similar to that being introduced by the Irish Government, what discussions were taking place between the British and Irish Governments regarding the possibility of an all-Ireland approach to the issue, what representations the Minister had received regarding the danger of the imposition of the law by the Irish Government creating a Border mentality, and if he would make a statement. The Minister, Paul Murphy, simply answered that the British Government had no plans to legislate in that area at present. No intergovernmental discussions had taken place on an all-Ireland ban, although officials had discussed areas of mutual interest, including tobacco control measures, through the existing North-South channels. No specific representations had been made to him about the potential impact of the ban.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Let us remember the new context of the Good Friday Agreement and look back on the progress that we made on foot and mouth disease. I was one of those who proposed in this House that we should try to have an all-Ireland structure as far as foot and mouth disease is concerned. We got agreement on that. The ports in Belfast and Larne were properly monitored, and the spraying units were there on the same basis as down here.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Let us move on to tourism. My party leader, Deputy Kenny, when he was the Minister for Tourism and Trade, set up the structures, North and South, which have now been cemented into a permanent structure to promote Ireland internationally on an all-island basis. The hotel and pub industry is very much related to tourism. We had an opportunity to move the situation forward, but unfortunately no effort was made in that direction, and I am extremely saddened by that. The Minister mentioned in his speech that he will try to move the matter forward at European level during the Irish Presidency of the European Union. I urge him to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I attended a family wedding in Vancouver this spring. During the eight hour flight nobody smoked and there was not a word about it. I mention this because it has been said the smoking ban did not work in Canada, but when our group of friends went to a public house on the night after the wedding and someone lit a cigarette, it was not a member of the bar staff but one of our peers who advised him to put it out quickly. I concur with Deputy Connaughton that this will be the case in many places.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Let us imagine what would happen in the Border counties if the father of the bride, who hosts and pays for a reception for 400 guests, takes out a cigarette or cigar at 4.00 a.m. and a young bar person has to tell him to put it out. I suggest we should make an all out effort at this late stage to take account of the Border areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I am worried about the legal position and ask the Minister to clarify that the Bill will stand up to the test by multinationals who are working night and day to find a way around it. I would not like to see that happening. The Fine Gael Party would want the legislation enforced if the Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The Bill deals with important issues, such as advertising; a ban on retail sales of packets of less than 20 cigarette; tighter controls on the sale of tobacco products from vending machines; and a ban on the sale of confectionery normally intended for children that resembles tobacco. Smoking is a major problem for young people, especially young women, and we are trying to find a way to deal with it. The Minister states clearly that this ban will save money as well as saving lives. There are aids for those who want to stop smoking, but it costs €7.61 for a packet of 30 Nicorette. It would be a positive step to subsidise such products and to make them more freely available to young people. I urge the Minister to consider this suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I attended a meeting of hoteliers and their staff in Cootehill some time ago where some very senior Fianna Fáil political figures were telling the Opposition how to ensure this impossible smoking ban would not be imposed. I have learnt that the vintners organisation congratulated the Minister of State, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, on the great work he had done on their behalf. We cannot have Members having one view for the local community and a different one when the vote is taken. If this is to work, the Government must ensure the legislation is workable.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I welcome the arrangements made for those in prisons or in psychiatric hospitals. There are, however, areas of difficulty such as deciding on what is a "bedroom" and if the staff who clean these bedrooms will be affected by those who smoke. We need to take a common sense approach to the implementation of the legislation. There needs to be a close relationship between the hoteliers, the Garda and everybody concerned so that those who are making a genuine effort to implement the legislation are not penalised unnecessarily. It will be peer pressure, not staff intervention, that will stop someone smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">There will be changes made to the Bill during its passage through the House, but in principle I support the ban on smoking.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Mr. Finneran</from>
          <p eId="para_301">I am pleased to speak on this important Bill. I was a member of the Seanad when the previous Bill, which I supported, was discussed in 2002. Nobody could disagree with this Bill's intent.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">There is general support for the important provision of a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays and on all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry. There would be support also for the registration of tobacco retailers and tougher penalties for those convicted of sales to under age persons. There is provision to ban the retail sale of packets of less than 20 cigarettes, but I wonder if all the 30% of people who smoke are always in a position to buy 20 cigarettes at one time. This may coax people to give up cigarettes.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">While I welcome the tighter controls on the sale of tobacco in vending machines, there are many who make their living from vending machine outlets which is now in jeopardy. I have had representations from people who have made major investments in vending machines. This group will certainly lose following the enactment of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Public disclosure of all aspects of tobacco, including toxicity and addiction, is important. Certain issues pertaining to the tobacco industry were not discussed or understood until recent years. Major investigations have been carried out in certain countries, the United States in particular, on certain components that may have been placed in cigarettes to increase or cause addiction. If this was the case, it is serious. We still do not or may not know the full story in this regard. It is important that the tobacco industry, which is very powerful, does not hoodwink the public about components that could lead to addiction or other complications. We know cigarette smoke is bad for both smokers and passive smokers, as those in the vicinity of smokers are generally labelled.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Having worked in the health care area for many years, I understand and support the Minister's attempt to introduce legislation that will protect and help people. I hope his example will be followed by other states in Europe.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_144">
          <from>Mr. Finneran</from>
          <p eId="para_308">Having worked in the health care area for many years, I obviously encourage and support measures and legislation that will reduce the number of smokers and ensure that those who do not smoke are not affected by those who do.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">I raised concerns earlier this year about the implementation of the legislation, especially in respect of the hospitality sector. I still have these concerns. The legislation could interfere to an extent with people's lives in rural areas. However, the thrust of the legislation is important. It is important that we send out a strong message to the public on the effects of tobacco use on health. It saddens me to see the number of young people who smoke, particularly young ladies. It is a cause of worry. I have often heard comments that smoking reduces one's appetite. It would be very unfortunate if this message were circulated, especially to young ladies.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">In one way or another smoking interferes with one's bodily make-up and contributes dramatically to the onset of some serious medical conditions and diseases. It is important that we reiterate this, <i>ad nauseam</i> if necessary. There are those who still argue that they or their acquaintances have smoked 20 or 40 cigarettes per day for 50, 60 or 70 years and are still in good health. This may be true in certain cases but, by and large, all the medical evidence available to us as legislators and to the public suggests that the inhalation of tobacco smoke, directly or passively, is detrimental to one's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">If we are to promote health to the exclusion of tobacco use among young people, we must identify with sport and keep it to the fore in the public mind. Most of those involved in sport do not smoke. I appreciate the massive investment in sport and recreation by Governments in recent times, particularly through national lottery grants to communities and clubs for sports facilities. The Government has good intentions in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I know a cost factor is involved but every school at every level should have physical education teachers. We have not achieved this yet and only the pupils of certain schools enjoy the benefits of having physical education teachers or physical education facilities. Their provision should be hammered home as important in promoting sport among young people. They would exclude the temptation to begin smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Some young people begin smoking by default because they do not have anything else to do. It is a pity this depends on who their friends are. There is plenty of research to back up the contention that children of smokers tend to smoke. Parents, therefore, need to be educated to kick the habit to ensure they do not pass it on to their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">On the question of whether the legislation will be fully implemented, it is not possible to legislate for everything. Regardless of how comprehensive the legislation or how many people police it, there will always be those who will ignore it and smoke in areas they should not. Similar legislation in force in certain states of the United States – the legislation here is broader as the ban will not be confined to smoking in public places – is widely breached. I have learned from radio reports and through contacts that in some areas and cities it is ignored and practically not implemented. If a ban on smoking in the workplace is introduced here, I hope it will be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">A statement I made earlier this year in which I called for the proposed ban to be implemented on a phased basis in the hospitality sector is a matter of record. Despite this, as someone who has worked in the health field for a long period, I accept that it would be better if smoking was not permitted in any workplace. A decision has already been taken to exclude certain areas, such as jails and psychiatric institutions, from the ban, and concern has been expressed about implementing it in bedrooms in guest accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">While I do not have the precise figures, smoking is more widespread in mainland Europe where people also tend to be heavier smokers. It also appears to be tolerated in public buildings on the Continent. At an airport in Spain a couple of weeks ago, for example, I saw a man walk through the middle of the concourse smoking a big cigar. There was clearly no problem about this because I saw cigarette butts practically everywhere in the vicinity of the bar. The requirement to abide by this legislation will, therefore, amount to an imposition on people from other parts of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">There are few outlets for social activity in some rural areas, which may have just one local pub in which people meet for a game of cards or whatever. In these areas there is a tradition of people going to pubs at night to have a drink, which is often combined with a smoke, either of cigarettes or a pipe and tobacco. The legislation will interfere with this group of people. One gentleman in my parish recently asked me if I was up in Dublin enacting legislation that would turn him into a criminal, which is a genuine point. Having said that, the legislation is for the greater good and the Minister is to be complimented on putting the health of the people first. I support the thrust and intent of the Bill and any difficulties I had with it concerned its implementation in the hospitality sector. I continue, however, to envisage some difficulties arising in its implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">It is evident that illnesses caused by tobacco use result in the loss of a significant number of hours in the workplace. Tobacco interferes with people's lives and the work rate and output of our manufacturing units. Medical professionals have to write certificates time and again for people suffering from chronic cardiovascular and chest problems caused by smoking. This has a knock-on effect on hospital beds and other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The bottom line of the legislation is that we must get an educational message across to the public, namely, that smoking harms one's health, even when one is in the vicinity of people who smoke. If we succeed in getting the message across that smokers are interfering with other people's lives, we will do a good day's work. The challenge is to educate our young people, particularly those leaving primary school for secondary level, not to take up the habit of smoking and carry it on into adulthood. The way to do this is through education and sport. In the past, many people believed one had to be a good footballer, hurler or camogie player to participate in sports. This is no longer necessarily the case and people can now get involved in sport in many ways without having to make the type of commitment that used to be expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I welcome and support the broad thrust of the legislation. I have outlined the concerns expressed by some of those involved in the hospitality sector. We will have to wait and see what will be the complications and problems which arise from the implementation of the workplace ban on smoking. By and large, however, this is important legislation which will promote better health.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_321">The controversial proposal to ban smoking in the workplace was not debated on the floor of the House when the relevant legislation was being passed in March 2002, even though it has since proved to have been one of the most explosive and emotive issues of recent years. The Public Health (Tobacco) Act, enacted during the lifetime of the previous Government, mainly dealt with the advertising and promotion of tobacco products and smoking among people aged under 18 years. It was welcome legislation. It is, perhaps, now even more important that we address the issue of advertising because smoking is now regarded as fashionable.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The Act also addressed the sale of cigarettes to those under 18 years and I recall at the time that there was great fanfare in my local health board about these provisions. Environmental health officers were sent out to carry out random checks and a small number of convictions were secured, which concerned shopkeepers. We have taken our eye of the ball, however, because the number of spot or undercover checks being carried out in shops has since decreased. This provision was beginning to bite.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The Act also provided for the establishment of the Office of Tobacco Control on a statutory basis. However, section 47(<i>f</i>) provides that the Minister for Health and Children may, by regulation, prohibit or restrict smoking in registered clubs, workplaces and pubs. Nothing was said about this when the legislation was going through the Dáil. It was unanimously accepted by all parties without any Member referring to the ban on smoking in the workplace. Now, however, we are daily assailed by a cacophony of Ministers of State, Ministers, Opposition spokespersons and county councillors calling for a reversal of the ban. It can best be described as a type of velvet revolution except that the time for such plaintive bleating is long past. Public representatives are playing to the gallery and the crowd at home. They should have had an opportunity to speak on the ban in the Dáil, where it matters. There is a touch of Tadhg an dá thaobh, running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, about their attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The summary nature of the implementation of the smoking ban has irked many people. This became apparent when the Minister implemented the regulations. The issue should have been brought before the House for debate. That would have eased tensions and released some of the pressure on Members. It would have shown the public that we had the nerve, and the way people have spoken against it would have required nerve, to discuss the ban in the House. Deputies did not have an opportunity to vote for or against the smoking ban in the forum where it mattered. The debate raged outside the House where talk is cheap. Many Deputies got away in the smoke on this issue, if Members will pardon the pun. They did not have to press the green or red button on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">It is incontrovertible that smoking causes cancer. The considerable pressure on our health services would be dramatically eased if there was a diminution in the number of people who smoke. A visit to any hospital ward will provide clear evidence that smoking and illness are linked. There is a particularly strong link between smoking and the number of people in medical wards. Many of them are smokers. I recall the ridiculous situation of seeing a person under an oxygen mask and then hearing the popping noise simply because they are smokers. That often happened. It is clear evidence of the harmful effects of smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Recent studies by ASH, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the Asthma Society of Ireland, nurses and trade union representatives provided convincing evidence that smoking causes cancer. These are reputable bodies and we cannot argue with their findings. They also highlighted the duty of everybody to strive to prevent the spread of insidious diseases such as emphysema, lung cancer and heart disease. More recent research has concluded that conditions linked to smoking include various irreversible health effects, including metastatic breast cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, lung haemorrhage, lupus, meningitis in children, multiple sclerosis and impaired immune system.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The dangers of breathing second-hand smoke or passive smoking, which was mainly responsible for the death of British comedian Roy Castle, has prompted recent smoking bans in New York city, Boston and Norway. It is difficult to estimate how much smoke non-smokers inhale. Some investigations have found that passive smoking has little effect on lung cancer or heart disease. However, when the results of various studies are gathered together and collated, a technique of metaanalysis, passive smokers tend to show a 20% to 30% increased risk of suffering these diseases. The evidence shows that passive smoking has an adverse effect and kills.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Most experts, therefore, remain convinced that passive smoking is as bad for the person as smoking a cigarette. This is particularly so for young children living in a home environment with smokers. Sadly, one also sees many parents smoking in cars despite the fact that children are sitting in the back. In such a closed environment they are getting the full effect of the cigarette. Then we wonder why children become addicted to cigarettes by the age of 12 or 14 years. It is already in their systems as a result of smoking in the home or in the family car. People should be more considerate of where they smoke when in the company of non-smokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The research is equally relevant in the case of highly exposed workers in bars and restaurants. They are also entitled to be shielded from the effects of second-hand smoke. The Irish Prison Service indicated that between 80% and 85% of male inmates smoke and almost 100% of female inmates are regular smokers. These are frightening statistics. One can imagine the effect this has in prisons. The service warns that in the event of a ban, cigarettes and tobacco products will become contraband which would rival the existing drugs culture, resulting in peer pressure and inmate disorder. It cautions against an abrupt transition to a smoke free environment that would lead to serious behaviour and operational difficulties. I have no doubt it would lead to such difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The service pointed out that while prisons are a workplace for many, they are also home for 3,000 prisoners who should be entitled to smoke. It advocated a more realistic solution such as exists in the US where a partial ban with designated smoking areas was introduced in prisons. We should listen to what these expert bodies say. A balancing act is required. The service must protect the workers' lives but also permit people whose abode for a certain period of time is the prison to smoke. It would be foolhardy to believe that a ban on smoking in prisons could be implemented without causing mayhem.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The personality of the smoker plays an important role in understanding the behavioural component of nicotine addiction. Adolescents who are more depressed, anxious or have low self-esteem may smoke to feel better or to fit in with their peers. It gives them an identity as one of the lads or one of the girls. Regrettably, many young girls smoke as an anti-obesity measure. They smoke to suppress their appetite and seem to believe that they will be better looking. Instead of eating properly during the day they choose cigarettes as an easy way out. It is a tragedy that school children hold the belief that smoking is cool or helps them to suppress their appetite. An educational approach will be required to counteract that belief.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Some time ago there were anti-smoking advertising campaigns aimed at school children. All anti-smoking advertising campaigns should be directed at that generation. We must make an impact at that level. Teenagers who tend to smoke have fewer coping resources. They feel out of control about their health while still remaining chained to the agent that causes this lack of control, the cigarette.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Cigarette companies are ruthless in terms of the additional substances they put into cigarettes. They use hundreds of chemicals to make the nicotine more addictive. One of the substances they use is rat poison. This is all to generate money. Researchers at Britain's Imperial Cancer Research Fund have studied what 2,031 smokers suck into their lungs and compared it with the tobacco industry estimates. They found that the tar and nicotine ratings on cigarette packets were unrelated to the smoker's actual intake. Regardless of what type of cigarette they smoked, they took in large amounts of nicotine just by puffing harder. People who smoked cigarettes containing very low nicotine levels, which according to the packet contained 0.14 milligrams of nicotine each, inhaled approximately eight times more nicotine than that. Smokers of higher nicotine brands took in 1.3 milligrams, approximately one and a half times more than the 0.8 milligrams the packet label suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Smokers and non-smokers have just a cursory understanding of the extent and magnitude of the health risks associated with cigarette smoking compared to other alleged health risks in the environment. In the current smoking controversy the opinions of the opposing camps are tossed back and forth, with both sides suspicious and accusing each other of having a hidden agenda. Some of them are not that hidden if one scratches beneath the surface of the agendas of those in favour of cigarette smoking. As a result, feelings of anger and distrust resonate and both sides fail to evaluate their arguments critically.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Ireland's vibrant pub culture has led to a forceful campaign by vintners and some hoteliers in an effort to secure some dilution of the legislation. The legislation has been diluted by allowing smoking in bedrooms of hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast accommodation, which is a tragedy. The legislation is already having an effect on hotels along the Border area in particular. For years, hotels on the southern side of the Border used to attract a large number of functions such as weddings, funerals and so on because of the excellent facilities available. People used to flock from the North for weddings. These hotels have now lost bookings which means money and jobs are being lost. While I am aware it is a contradiction, I believe that if an hotel bedroom can be exempt from the smoking ban, neither should there be a ban on smoking if someone books a private room in a hotel for a day for a private function. There should be some provision for this type of situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Similar bans do not appear to have sounded the death knell of the hospitality industry in the United States. The workplace ban is favoured by most health professionals. However, to ban smoking in psychiatric hospitals and hospices would remove the one crutch remaining to patients. It could have the effect of aggravating their illness, with a consequent increase in agitation. The withdrawal effects of nicotine addiction are very severe. It is not easy to go through these withdrawal symptoms. I went through it on a number of occasions, the last occasion being January 1999. It would be unfair to impose the ban on someone who is suffering from an acute illness. The psychiatric institutions have been well ahead of the law in terms of designating smoking areas in all their institutions. In that regard, the ban will not have a major impact because these institutions are well ahead of the posse in advising people to quit smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Many of the health services have set up smoking cessation groups, which is welcome. The provision of patches to help staff stop smoking is also welcome. There has been much advertising recently on how to stop smoking, and the more that is seen the better. In the case of terminally ill patients in hospitals, it would be unmitigated cruelty to deny these patients the comfort of a cigarette in the final days of their life. It gets to the stage when there is no point trying to convert people. We should try to facilitate people who have just a certain length of time to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The main consideration in regard to any smoking ban must be public health. It is significant that Ireland will become the first country in Europe to implement such a ban in the workplace in 2004. We would all have been much happier if it had been a Europe-wide effort, or if we kept banging doors in Europe to have a European ban introduced. Ireland is out on a limb in this regard. Those involved in the tourism industry are worried because, as Deputy Finneran said earlier, people on the Continent are very heavy smokers. When I visit there I notice the large numbers of people who smoke. There is a possibility that we could chase these people away. I would have been happier if there had been a Europe-wide ban on smoking because it would have been easier to accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Trade union representatives are in unanimous agreement that smoking, having killed more than 150 bar workers in Ireland each year, should be banned in pubs. It is patently clear that the smoking ban in pubs and clubs is inevitable. Under the previous legislation, staff of airlines and bingo halls were happy to comply with the ban in the interest of public health. I recall when smoking was banned by airlines people thought it would be the end of the aviation industry. It was thought that people could never fly to the United States or Australia without smoking. However, this attitude has changed because it did not have this effect. It is much more comfortable for people to enter a smoke free environment, which is how it will be in future in pubs and clubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Publicans, loath to offend their patrons, were reluctant to agree to the ban. Recent surveys in Montana in the United States revealed that the incidence of heart attacks dropped dramatically, which is something we cannot ignore. Protecting people from tobacco toxins saves lives as well as making the environment more pleasant.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The smoking debate has heightened awareness that cigarettes are carcinogens and cause illness. A debate such as this each year might wake people up to this fact.</p>

        <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_342">I had the honour of chairing the health committee over two Government periods. I regard a report written by the former Deputy, Alan Shatter, in 1999 and discussed by the committee as being one of the major signposts in terms of dealing with an anti-smoking strategy. It was followed by a further report written by Deputy Gay Mitchell a number of years later. Having studied all the impacts of smoking, the committee unanimously recommended on both occasions that smoking in pubs should be banned. At the time we were regarded as being "out of our tree" and it has taken a long time for the wisdom of the reports to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The Minister, Deputy Martin, must be congratulated on taking the initiative in this regard and ensuring that the whole issue of a healthy lifestyle and smoking is now in the mainstream in terms of the health of the nation. It is now accepted that smoking is injurious to one's health. All the figures suggest that 7,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses. It is interesting to note that in 1973 49% of people smoked. If one considers the current situation, one will find that cessation strategies have been working, perhaps not at the pace we would wish, but we have gone from a position where 49% of people smoked to 29%. It is hoped that figure will reduce to 20% by 2010. This will certainly be achievable given the expressions of interest, the element of legislation and the health promotion outlets that are beginning to manifest themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">It is interesting to note in the recent debate the views of the hospitality industry in regard to smoking in public houses, hotels and so on. I can well understand that people who may have stocks in place and high overheads would have a vested interest. Of course these people are concerned about a loss of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I can understand that these people would promote a filtration system as being the answer. Unfortunately, the World Health Organisation and all the statistics, science and information available suggest clearly that any filtration system will not be adequate to remove the carcinogens from the atmosphere. Therefore it is important in terms of the health and safety of the workers that we look seriously at how to protect their health.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">For those working in a bar there is a much higher concentration of smoking in that venue than in other areas. There is no doubt they have to deal with a high concentration of smoke and their health is at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I have looked at tobacco companies suppressing the knowledge that cigarette smoking was addictive and the class actions taken in the United States on the basis of the suppression of that knowledge. If a Minister for Health and Children and a Government, aware that passive smoking is injurious to health, having put in place health and safety legislation to protect the rights of workers, did not take measures to protect the health and safety of those in the workplace, the Government, like the tobacco companies, could be subject to a class action.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I am always concerned about addiction and how we deal with it. I am concerned about the relationship between legislation, health promotion at Department of Health and Children level, at health board level and, particularly, the interaction with schools. Having chaired a health board for two years I am aware that much of our interaction with schools is hit and miss. We will have to look seriously at how to integrate better the role of the health promotion unit within the health boards and the schools. It is interesting that many of the posts of responsibility in various schools tend to be administrative in nature and structure. There would certainly be a post of responsibility for the promotion of sport. In this modern day we should seek to have a health promotion officer in every school. I urge the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science to liaise to ensure that interaction takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I wish to deal briefly with the price of cigarettes. In our studies, when compiling the two reports, we visited Florida and sought information from progressive countries such as Canada which found a direct relationship between the price of the tobacco product and consumption. It was gleaned that for every 10% increase on a packet of 20 cigarettes there was likely to be a corresponding 2.5% to 5% fall off in the level of smoking. Therefore, there is a correlation between the price of cigarettes and the amount of cigarettes smoking. When the Government is involved in negotiations with the partnership it is odd that the union representatives, who are there to look after the interests and the welfare of workers, have not yet agreed to remove the price of cigarettes from the consumer price index. That is a step the unions should take. It would be a leap forward and would be in the best interests of their workers. I am at a loss to understand why that has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I can speak only of the human misery brought about by smoke related diseases. I think of the families and the individuals affected by lung cancer, a stroke or whatever. There is a correlation between all of these diseases and smoking. In our report we deemed the matter so serious that we thought the State should take an action against the tobacco companies. I understood the Minister was to take it up directly with the Attorney General and was to ask if this case could be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The cost of treating smoking related diseases in our hospitals is astronomical. It has been suggested the cost could be in the region of €100 million per annum. We would all prefer to see that money going towards those on social welfare, housing, improving the health services and other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">It is true that we take a fair share of taxation from the industry and that the product is heavily taxed. However, given the reduction in smoking, this will be an area of diminishing tax returns. In terms of people's welfare and the human misery being experienced we must try to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">It is disconcerting in all the Slán reports that there is a significant increase in the number of young girls taking up smoking. Obviously the placement and timing of advertisements was a contributory factor. Another factor that had to be taken into account was that if one smokes one will not put on weight. In any promotion in which we get involved we must target young girls to ensure smoking is not seen as chique.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The efforts made by the Minister will bear fruit in the long run. I pay tribute to the Opposition parties whose support has been constant in terms of an anti-smoking strategy in the House and outside. Many people must take courage from the fact that when vested interests, and others, tried to convince this House and the Seanad that a ban was not in people's best interests they stood firm, by and large, and this ban will now take effect later than it could have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I have several reservations about the regulations. When exemptions are made for one area, others will also look for exemptions. One can understand the exemptions for jails, psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes, but if it is injurious to the health of bar workers then it will be injurious to the health of people working in those other facilities, and I am concerned about that. I urge the Minister not to grant exemptions under any circumstances to RTE for some of the programmes it makes. Are our film makers and drama producers suggesting that they will portray the lifestyle we want, or one that we are trying to eradicate and change by putting in place an anti-smoking strategy? It would be appropriate to resist exemptions in that field.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBruton" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Mr. J. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_356">This Bill is about smoking, not passive smoking. The evidence in regard to damage from smoking is overwhelming. The legislation will have the effect of discouraging many people from smoking because they will not be able to smoke when having a drink with their friends in the pub. The social opprobrium that will attach to people attempting to smoke in a pub will deter them from smoking even outside the pub. It will gradually make smoking socially unacceptable. That is the real agenda behind this legislation. I agree with Deputy Batt O'Keeffe in regard to the effect of passive smoking in pubs because the concentration of smoke there is far higher than in other workplaces. That apart, smoking in workplaces in general is not a major problem but smoking is. I support the underlying agenda of this and related EU legislation, which will work, to make smoking unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I have had sympathetic conversations with members of the licensed trade in my constituency about the issue of a staggered introduction. However, this would put the publicans to the additional expense of having to divide their premises for a year and then close off the divided part later, and they would have to put up signs then take them down. If one is going to introduce this ban it is best to do it immediately rather than try to stagger its introduction. Publicans are concerned about their customers and the first days of the implementation when they want to be able to tell customers that they can smoke at the far end of the bar, rather than throw them out. This may have a temporary validity but in the long run it is better to implement the ban at once and be done with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">We have to recognise that this is criminal legislation, criminalising an activity which has not hitherto been a crime. People complain frequently that there are not enough Garda resources to enforce this or that law, yet those people frequently also suggest the criminalisation of more activities. There is tension here between saying that one does not want higher taxes to provide more salaries for people to become law enforcers and demanding the criminalisation of other activities. Any extension of the criminal law will displace activity from one area into another. This legislation will lead to more people drinking and smoking at home. Many people say they drink only in the pub or at a party and not at home, and they do not even have drink in the house. It will increasingly be the case that those who want to continue to smoke, and who drink, will do both at home. This will have consequences for their children. When they drink and smoke in the pub they are less of a problem to the children.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">There is also the problem that if people get drunk and smoke at home they are much more likely to set their houses on fire. The legislation could lead to an increase in the number of house fires associated with people falling asleep, as many do when in a comfortable chair and the television is not as entertaining as it should be, cigarette in hand. They will not fall asleep in a bar. It is likely that there will be an increase in the number of deaths from fires caused by unextinguished cigarettes. That is why I am advocating that we should introduce legislation similar to that in New York state requiring that all cigarettes retailed in this jurisdiction be self-extinguishing. We are modelling our smoking ban on New York legislation but we are not following its precedent in regard to self-extinguishing cigarettes. Why not? If it can be done in New York, which is only one of the United States, why can it not be done in this State which is only one member of the European Union? The technology is relatively simple and does not cause a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">To make such a recommendation does not encourage smoking, it simply ensures that people do not die in house fires. If someone is smoking and drinking in the house and falls asleep causing a fire the likelihood is that four or five other people who are not smokers and did not volunteer to be in that situation will also die. By contrast, most of the people who might be affected by smoking in pubs volunteer to be there, apart from the employees. There is a very strong ethical case for introducing self-extinguishing cigarettes as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I am also concerned about the exemption for smoking in hotel bedrooms. For example, after a wedding some people might stay in the hotel while others will hang around drinking. Those who want to smoke will have their drinks sent up to the bedroom of the hotel guests and will smoke and drink up there rather than downstairs. There are already problems about non-residents drinking after hours in a hotel bedroom but let us assume that people want to do so within the normal hours, is this desirable? No. There will be less supervision of associated activities if it is taking place in a hotel bedroom than in the usual areas for serving drink, the bar or the lounge. That is another diversion of trade which will occur as a result of this legislation, on whose consequences the Government ought to reflect.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I understand there is an exemption for clubs which are not a place of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I assume this will mean that if, for example, my local GAA club, which does not employ a full-time barman, has a club member serving drink, people can smoke in the clubhouse. So long as the barman is not paid and the clubhouse is not constituted to be a place of work, there is an exemption. That will lead to a diversion of trade. All the smokers will join the local clubs to drink and smoke in places where they are served by someone working behind the bar who is not paid for that work and does it on a voluntary basis, as I did myself in my earlier days.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I do not agree with Deputy Batt O'Keeffe that cigarettes should be removed from the consumer price index. One could make a case for removing many undesirable items from the index because they are supposedly unacceptable. On that basis one could make a case for alcohol being removed from the CPI because, to my knowledge, it does not do people any good in the sense of what is deemed to be good in this assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The social partners should agree that they will have one index which includes all goods legitimately on sale, including cigarettes, and another for wage adjustment purposes. There should be two indices, but we should not interfere with the integrity of our statistical system. The consumer price index should be an accurate and full account of prices. It should not be socially engineered for another purpose. If one wants to use part of the index for another purpose, a separate index should be created. It is important to have comprehensive, accurate and non-judgmental economic statistics. For that reason I do not agree with Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Deputy also suggested that, for every 10% increase in cigarette prices, there is a 12.5% fall-off in smoking. I agree, but there might also be a 1% increase in crime. I am aware that the Provisional IRA has been and probably still is involved in the cigarette smuggling business in this State to fund its inestimable activities. Other gangsters are also involved in the business. The reason is the price of cigarettes. If they can provide lower price cigarettes which are not subject to excise tax, they have opportunities to make a profit. We must recognise that the more one drives activities and commodities into the black economy, the more market opportunities, so to speak, one creates for the Provisional IRA and similar organisations such as the Real IRA and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Deputy Batt O'Keeffe also questioned the notion that we should allow film makers to show films in which people are smoking on the grounds that we should not allow the screening of films which portray undesirable lifestyles. I can understand why the Deputy might say this given that he is a member of Mr. de Valera's party, which believes that we should only ever portray comely maidens dancing at crossroads. If one were to accept his logic, one could not show a crime movie, because crime is certainly not a lifestyle we want to portray. If people are not allowed to be seen smoking in a movie, they should not be allowed to be seen stealing in one either. Under the O'Keeffe test, almost all movies would have to be banned. Have people thought this through? If the idea is that a socially unacceptable activity should not be portrayed in a movie, then cigarette smoking is not the only socially unacceptable activity. There must be some underlying and consistent principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Any Government policy on smoking should be related to some rational risk-based strategy which assesses the reality of various risks. Findings in the United States by Tyler G. Miller indicate that natural radon seeping into homes causes between 15,000 and 22,000 lung cancer deaths in the United States every year, which is approximately 10% of all lung cancer deaths. This would put it far ahead of passive smoking. US research indicates that the number of deaths from passive smoking amounts to only 3,000 deaths per year in the United States compared with the 15,000 to 22,000 deaths attributable to radon. That means that naturally occurring radon accounts for between five and seven times as many deaths as passive smoking. Natural radon accounts for 55% of all radon to which human beings are exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">We have a Government which is quite rightly taking action on passive smoking, but which abolished grants for eliminating radon from homes. If the Government is adopting an accurate risk-based policy in regard to cancer risk, it should be as concerned about the 91,000 houses with excessive radon levels which dramatically increase the risk of fatal lung cancer and are between five and seven times as dangerous as the situation created by passive smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">According to maps published by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, in my county there is a radon concentration in excess of 200 becquerels per cubic metre in the Stamullen-Gormanston, Skreen-Dunshauglin and Moynalty-Nobber areas and in Athboy. There are slightly lesser but unacceptably high risks of radon being found in Slane, Duleek, Ballivor and Crossakeel, the latter being the area from where Deputy Johnny Brady comes, in case anyone is unaware of that. Navan is safe, as is Dunboyne, I am glad to say. There may be some relation between the political affiliation of people and radon. Perhaps radon makes people Fianna Fáil. I had better be careful or I might lose a few votes in some of the areas to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Government should treat this as seriously as it treats smoking. One cannot draw up a David and Goliath scenario, so beloved of the media, with a Minister as David taking on Goliath in the form of the licensed trade and tobacco industry. That makes for a good dramatic scenario which gets attention for the Government and perhaps draws attention away from issues from which the Government wants it taken away. There is certainly merit in that for the smoking argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">One cannot do that in regard to radon. One cannot blame the British, the tobacco industry or anyone for radon. It simply exists. It comes up through the floorboards of 20% of the homes in the places to which I referred and people are at a high risk of dying of cancer unless they do something about it. What has the Government done? It got rid of the one set of grants that were available for introducing the necessary testing and ventilation to identify the risk and, if necessary, undertake steps to eliminate the risk of lung cancer deaths from radon exposure. These grants should be reinstated.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I commend the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland for having published maps which I have been able to use in identifying places in my county where radon risk exists. Such maps are there for everybody's constituency and one can see exactly the areas with the greatest risk. I am concerned that so little is being done about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I want to raise some technical, not to say legalistic, points. The Short Title of the Bill refers to a list of EU directives which the Bill is supposed to implement. My understanding is that legislation shall not go beyond the scope set out by the Short Title, yet it seems that action is being taken that may well go beyond its remit. I would like it clarified that there is no problem in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Section 15 of the legislation refers to prohibiting or restricting the smoking of tobacco products in certain premises. I question whether this should be confined to particular premises at all times or whether it should not be possible also for the Minister to say, "I shall prohibit smoking in these premises during these times and not at other times."  Periods of time rather than areas of space should also be capable of being the subject of a smoking ban. I suggest an additional paragraph 15(1)(<i>h</i>) which would provide for other premises between particular hours when such premises are being used for work. There are premises that are used for work for one or two hours a week. I cite the example of a community centre where people pursue entirely voluntary activities but where a cleaner is paid to clean the premises for one or two hours a week. It should be clearly the case that smoking is prohibited or capable of being prohibited during the period when it becomes a place of work. There does not seem to be a facility in the Bill to make such a provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">On the previous occasion when this legislation was being discussed I expressed the opinion that legislation should be precise. It should not give to the Minister any powers that are vague or potentially excessive. It is the function of this House to ensure that the Executive is strictly limited in what it may do and that it may only do that which is necessary to the achievement of the objectives which the House has determined should be set. On that basis I have a problem with section 15(1)(<i>g</i>), which provides that the Minister may prohibit or restrict the smoking of tobacco products in all or part of any other premises or place generally, or of such a class as may be specified in the regulations. That could allow the Minister to make a ban applicable anywhere. I do not think that is what the House intends and that section should be more tightly drawn so as to confine it to what the House intends at this time. This legislation should not be a blank cheque.</p>

          <p eId="para_386">This debate provides an opportunity to discuss the issue of tobacco. Sir Walter Raleigh brought tobacco to Europe in the 1580s and since then we have had a very unhealthy and romantic interest in cigarettes and cigarette smoke. It reached a high point when Ella Fitzgerald sang about a cigarette with lipstick traces and airline tickets to romantic places. Since the 1580s, European society has enjoyed a wonderful relationship with tobacco where tobacco has been romanticised beyond the facts. In my view, James I was correct when he described it as the "noxious weed". He seemed to have got the health argument right quite early on although it does not appear to have helped him. The phenomenon has spread since he made that pronouncement.</p>

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_388">I pay tribute to all the Opposition Deputies who have upheld what I would term a cross-party consensus through very difficult times over the last few months on the issue of the smoking ban and the control of tobacco. It has become a matter for consensus across the floor of the House, like the consensus on matters pertaining to Northern Ireland and social consensus in the partnership process. It has also become a matter for consensus in many other Parliaments across Europe. Political parties do not seriously disagree about tackling and taking on the tobacco industry and the habit which forms from the use of tobacco.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I am a smoker and I would like to kick the habit but one must live in hope in that regard. This Bill is a courageous move by the Minister. It is noteworthy that Ireland has always taken the lead in this area. This House is often criticised for always slavishly following directives and regulations, the diktats from Europe and Brussels, but we have led in the area of legislation governing smoking and advertising of tobacco. Another former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, initiated this process during his wilderness years in the Department of Health when he was waiting to take charge of the country. He saw fit to take on the tobacco industry and many of the controls and regulations he introduced at that time became the model for subsequent European directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">From my period of service with the European Commission I am aware that it does not always act in a neutral manner on the issue of tobacco or the health-related side of the argument. There are significant European countries which are still producers of tobacco and are heavily dependent on it. Some wealthy European countries still have a vested interest in promoting tobacco and that makes it difficult even at Commission level to push through certain regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The Minister has again taken the centre stage with the issue of tobacco and the Hanly report. He has fought against terrible odds on behalf of both. The publicans are an influential lobby and in my view, over-reacted to the proposed regulations. Whether by accident or design, the Minister has arrived at a position where the implementation has been staggered and delayed to February and that is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The owner of my local pub is planning to phase in the smoking ban as the final deadline approaches. Publicans are now being proactive in acclimatising their customers to the new reality. Many people wonder if it will be possible to enforce the ban but if the publicans take this type of responsible attitude, acclimatising their customers ahead of the full implementation by designating certain areas as smoke-free ahead of the Bill becoming law, that is a healthy attitude and is a sign that publicans are prepared to work with the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">There has been some controversy because 14 of the 53 sections of the Bill are being re-enacted in the House. It is unclear whether this has occurred through accident or design. The advantage is that it has led to a later deadline and it is to be welcomed from the point of view of due caution. For obvious reasons, because of the legal action taken by the tobacco industry, the Attorney General was being very cautious, as lawyers always are, in my experience, and perhaps even excessively so in this case, about the potential for a downside risk such as a legal challenge or ambush. The Attorney General in his wisdom decided that these sections should be re-enacted. I disagree with his view, not in a political but rather a principled way. I believe that on the grounds of public health alone one could have enacted these provisions without having to re-enact the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The Minister is taking the advice of the Attorney General. I believe all Members of this House would be very disappointed if for whatever reason, some tendentious legal action by the tobacco industry were to seriously scupper or delay the enactment of this legislation on public health grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">They have decided to be cautious – that is how lawyers and Attorneys General behave and the Minister is right to listen to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">It also allows for the happy accident that the regulations will be phased in with due warning and not immediately on 1 January. Many people feared the ban would be introduced overnight on 1 January, when people make all sorts of promises and, within a week of taking on pious hopes, they feel dejected because they did not fulfil them. It would be an odd time of the year to introduce a full ban because many people travel in hope rather than expectation and end up being disappointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The detailed provisions are in line with the thrust of European governance on tobacco control. I agree with Deputy John Bruton when he disagreed with Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who is vociferous in pushing the case for preventing film and programme makers for RTE and other broadcasters from allowing actors to play out their roles while smoking. The only way this practice can be discouraged is by moral persuasion rather than the blunt instruments of policy and regulation. It is dangerous to interfere with the artistic desire to be creative and it would be foolish to legislate to prevent creative people from depicting situations which may not be healthy but are common. There is no point in being more of a roundhead than a cavalier; the tendency to punish all forms of joy is also unhealthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I was taken by some of Deputy John Bruton's exceptions. I doubt people will crowd into hotel bedrooms after weddings in Nobber or Slane to have a smoke and drink, that will not happen.</p>

That fear is misplaced, like that of people crowding into GAA clubs to have one last gasper because the person behind the bar is a volunteer rather than an employee. GAA clubs staffed by volunteers in a club atmosphere could be designated as non-smoking areas because the bar counter is a workplace regardless of whether people are working voluntarily. I am open to contradiction – I see Deputy Olivia Mitchell shaking her head.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">The GAA can be ingenious in the manner it attracts customers to its clubs to enjoy themselves but it will not be in a position to encourage such action.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Deputy John Bruton was right that much of this is to do with persuasion. When the idea of the smoking ban was raised many people asked how it would be enforced, would there have to be gardaí or environmental health officers telling people to put their cigarettes out? Once something is known to be coming into force, the people will enforce it. That is obvious when using airlines or public transport because people are not foolhardy enough to take on their fellow passengers. There are, of course, exceptions. The major one I have seen when travelling on the bus is that people are more likely to light a joint than a cigarette. There are reckless youths on a number of bus routes lighting joints rather than ordinary cigarettes to enjoy themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The publicans over-reacted to this measure and they have now recognised that they will have to work within it. The Taoiseach was right when he said that certain people would now return to the pubs as a result of the smoking ban. There is a high rate of asthmatic and bronchial disorder in Ireland and many people who like a drink do not go to the pub because they feel the atmosphere is not conducive to their good health. They do not like to leave a pub after an hour with the intense odour of cigarette smoke on their clothes and skin, a huge issue for many people. I see a boon for the licensing trade with customers who are passing up the opportunity to go to a pub returning to it as a result of the ban.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The smoking ban throws down a challenge to publicans to become more competitive. Economic growth has reduced but it is still healthy, and they can address the issues of price and entertainment. Do they provide food and entertainment other than alcohol? The licensing trade can be legitimately criticised for the way it has developed in Ireland, although I do not blame publicans because there are multi-faceted reasons this has occurred, but we must move beyond the pub being a place purely for imbibing. Historically and culturally it is a social centre in Irish life and the publican is under an obligation to address prices. There has been a huge increase in wealth in the country and although the inflation problem has been somewhat banished, the price of drink has not been brought down in this period. There must be a sign that prices will reduce and that there will be a diversity of entertainment in pubs by way of music, food and other distractions.</p>

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_413">That will require investment and ingenuity on the part of publicans. In my constituency, the publicans who are investing in entertainment and keeping their customers happy are those who do best and have most repeat business. No business can rely on passing trade or the phenomenal appeal of the large, trendy pubs in town which capture the young drinkers for a period and then lose them within a year to someone else. They must invest in the repeat customers who go there because they like the ambience and the way the staff behave, perform and interact with the customers and the other people who go there. That is the only way to keep a pub in business.</p>

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_415">I am not sure what the Deputy is implying but staff need to be able to perform and interact. There is a danger of our encouraging a pub culture where there is smoking and drinking but no interaction between bar staff and customers. The staff fire out drink and change for cigarettes and the place fills with smoke. Such an industrialised application of the licensed trade is not attractive. It is unhealthy and may contribute to the phenomenon of excessive drinking that now exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">On the restrictive licensing hours, we should move as best we can to a system where there is open availability of alcohol at all hours, perhaps even on a 24 hour basis, and a much lighter regime in terms of regulation. I understand why the Government has moved to impose restrictions at certain times – it is because of the public order issues – but if we were a mature people in terms of our relationship with alcohol we would be able to cope with all-night openings and there would not be the sort of reckless experience we have seen to date when we extended those hours. We should be able to aspire to having round-the-clock licensing hours but we have a unique problem with alcohol and cigarettes – I do not say this in a patronising way about our people – and we need to address both of those issues in a sensible and ordered way, though not in a zealous way that will restrict people's rights to imbibe and enjoy themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">When the debate about this ban was at its height, I moved around my constituency in the normal manner meeting bar staff, publicans and customers, and the idea was quickly reinforced to me that while publicans were making a strong case against it, their staff were coming up to me privately and saying, "Well done, keep it up, please bring this in."  The same staff, unfortunately, were subjected to pressure to sign petitions against it. They signed them but they did not believe in them. They believed in what the Minster and all the parties in this House are doing. The Minister is not doing this alone. He is doing it in conjunction with the fine support that has been given on it by the members of the Opposition who have decided, in a very responsible manner, to stay with the cross-party consensus which we need to deal with this difficulty occasioned by our smoking habits.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I hope the Department will listen to me when I say that in addition to the tablets, the gum and the patches, the Bill should be extended to include acupuncture as a way of treating this addiction. We need to increase the number of people who can get a diversity of treatments under the GMS and the medical card to help them kick the habit.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">This is an issue of extreme importance which has major implications. We have all heard that prevention is better than cure and this measure is one way of dealing with this problem. No more than Mr. Haughey's toothbrushes, this legislation has become a smokescreen for addressing many issues which we should have more time to discuss in the House, such as the situation in Castlebar hospital where 11 people are currently on trolleys and there is lack of capacity in the hospital, although that is nothing new. The manager spoke about this on radio today and mentioned the need for people to stay away from the hospital. The staff are hard working and I hope they get the support they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Smoking kills nearly five million people per year – 7,000 Irish citizens die every year as a result of smoking. In his contribution the Minister outlined very well the scale of the problems that arise from smoking. Smoking is the largest preventable cause of cancer. That is a major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Deputy John Bruton talked about radon gas, but radon gas and smoking have a cumulative effect when combined. I support the Deputy's call for grants for remedial measures to be introduced. I was one of the first people to talk about the health implications of radon, although Dr. McLoughlin in UCD was the pioneer in this area. It is important to remember that preventative measures make a difference. That is not to take away from the situation regarding passive smoke, which is a major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">These are problems we can do something to address. We can do something about stopping people from smoking. I know when people start smoking they do not realise the harmful effects of cigarettes. How can they know? When the generation before me started smoking – I am not that old – they were told that Craven A soothes the throat and that smoking was good for them. We now know that is not the case. When I started in medicine we studied all the reports from Doll and Hill, which were published years earlier, but the tobacco industry never accepted those reports or the link between smoking and ill health. If we were depending on the tobacco industry, we would still be waiting and the harm would continue. There was talk about immoral earnings, but the fact that cigarette companies earn large amounts from cigarettes is immoral and it has to be seen in that light because smoking damages health and destroys families, and it will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">What really influences young people are the smoking habits of their families and peers. What their friends do is very important to young people and if their friends are smoking, they are likely to smoke. If their parents smoke, they are likely to smoke also. Many parents tell their children, "Do as I say and not as I do."  They tell them not to smoke, yet they smoke themselves. They tell them not to drink, yet they drink alcohol. The children do not get these habits from the wind, and it is important that we look at our own habits.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Another aspect that influences smoking habits is the price of cigarettes. I ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to continue to raise the price of cigarettes. Advertising also has a strong effect on people and this legislation deals with advertising. There is direct and indirect sponsorship and we all know about the effects on young people of glamorising smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">It is obvious that smoking has become an anti-social practice. The Irish Cancer Society called for the removal of tobacco from the basket of goods in the consumer price index because it is a major block to Government putting substantial tax increases on tobacco products. I call on the Minister to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">It is said that 80% of young smokers become addicted before the age of 20 and that they have little awareness of the damage they are doing. The addictive effects of tobacco are enormous. Tobacco is one of the major addictions and there is great difficulty in trying to give up cigarettes. Eight out of ten young people become addicted in their teens. The current aggressive advertising campaign shows atheromatous plaque being squeezed out of the aorta, the main blood vessel in the body. Atheroma does not come with age, it results from smoking and so on. These are great advertisements and they need to be shown.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I remember as a student the first time I saw the lung of a smoker I was horrified because it looked more like a sack of coal than the pink, vibrant organ responsible for aerating the person's blood and keeping him alive. That horrific scene should be depicted on every cigarette packet, and I am glad to see the legislation moving towards that. Shock tactics are needed because the effects of this serious problem are great. The World Health Organisation has said that smoking is the biggest cause of premature deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Chronic bronchitis is very common in Ireland – like England, we have a damp climate – it is called the English disease. Many people have what is called smoker's cough, although the tobacco industry would deny that, but it is really the start of a very serious disease which does untold harm and will result in more people getting respiratory infections. They wake up in the morning with phlegm, they may have a cough for three months during the winter and eventually have it all year long. The person is constantly coughing up phlegm. The delicate cells that the Lord has given us convert to graveyard cells which produce mucus. These delicate cilia, which are responsible for excreting foreign substances from the body, are turned into mucous cells which produce mucus. That mucus is our bodies' reaction to terrible abuse over the years. The proposed measures will make a difference to the people who smoke because smoking is so harmful. Young people do not have any excuse and it is good they get the information they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I used to smoke, but I gave them up when my first child was born. As I am an ex-smoker, I do not like being in pubs because people smoke there and I would be tempted to start smoking again. I tried several times to give them up before I finally succeeded. I was a doctor at the time, so I should have known better.</p>

      the underspend in the Border, midlands and western region under the national development plan; the action he intends to take to address the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_432">Expenditure on national roads and public transport in the BMW region over the period 2000 to 2002 amounted to €748 million. This is approximately 64.5% of that forecast under the national development plan and its associated economic and social infrastructure operational programme. Expenditure on national roads was €593 million or 69% of the amount forecast, while expenditure on public transport was €155 million or 51% of that forecast. Final expenditure figures for 2003 will not be available until early 2004, but are not expected to change these proportions substantially.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The underspend on national roads in the BMW region reflects the increased cost of the national roads programme and the number of high cost projects in the south and east regions that had advanced through planning which absorbed a substantial proportion of the available funding since 2000. In response to my request in the context of the 2003 Estimates, the National Roads Authority has advanced a number of national roads projects in the BMW region and, as a result, work has either started or is due to start in the coming months on ten projects benefiting the BMW region, namely, the Carrickmacross bypass, the Sligo inner relief route, two projects – Hughestown-Meara and McNeads Bridge-Kinnegad – on the N4, the Dundalk western bypass, and the Kilcock-Kinnegad, Monasterevin, Loughrea, Ballina-Bohola and Ballyshannon-Bundoran bypasses. These projects represent an investment of more than €750 million and will substantially improve road access to and within the BMW region.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">While financial progress in the BMW region on public transport projects to date has been slower than anticipated, it is recognised that significant physical progress has been made on key rail infrastructural projects, for example, rail track work and associated works under the rail safety programme and the rail track and resignalling project. The key rail lines into the BMW region are on target to be completely upgraded to continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers by the end of 2003. Work on the network track and resignalling project in the BMW region is proceeding satisfactorily and work was completed on the Dublin-Galway line in June this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">It must also be borne in mind that certain projects, for example, the upgrading and improvements in Heuston Station at a cost of more than €100 million, the employment created in Drogheda arising from the new diesel rail depot, the upgrading of the rail lines out of Dublin to the west and south and the new rolling stock being acquired benefit the BMW region.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"><i>Additional information</i>In considering the balance of investment between the regions, it is important to bear in mind that the roads and public transport infrastructure investment programmes are national programmes with national benefits. The benefits of the investment are not confined to one region. As regards infrastructural development at the regional airports of Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Knock, all agreed projects will be completed broadly within the specified NDP budget and on time.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">Will the Minister correct the record because, to the best of my knowledge, Heuston Station is not in the BMW region? What benefit will the Monasterevin bypass and the Dundalk motorway have for the BMW region? What benefit will the new maintenance works in Drogheda have for the BMW region?</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Minister outlined the fall-off in funding in the BMW region. However, there has been a 138% spend on roads in the south and east region compared with the target set. The figure for public transport is 174%. There does not seem to be a difficulty with the costs of projects in the south and east compared with the BMW region. Since the Minister took office, the spend in the BMW region stands at 48% of that forecast, which is significantly lower than the average, but it is significantly higher in the south and east region. The Minister has continued that policy in 2003.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_176" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_439">I made it clear to the National Roads Authority and to agencies such as the Railway Procurement Agency that I expect the balance to be addressed. Deputy Naughten referred to the reasons, such as the increased cost of the programme. There were a number of high priority, high cost projects in the south and east which were advanced in planning and which absorbed additional funding. I acknowledge that investment in the roads programme in the BMW region is behind that anticipated. I expect the National Roads Authority to catch up in that regard as soon as possible. Public transport investment in the BMW region is also behind what it should be in terms of the national development plan. I have also asked CIE to catch up in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">We are taking measures to restore the balance. Ten projects in or partly in the BMW region are at tender stage, while a further 25 major projects in the BMW region on the N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N15, N17 and N18 are at planning stage. All these will come on stream over the next few years. The Deputy knows that the investments in the east, such as the tunnel and the M50, have absorbed funding beyond what was anticipated. That has affected the BMW region. We must acknowledge that the figures I have given the House today recognise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I know that roads such as the Kilcock-Kinnegad bypass and Heuston Station are not in the BMW region. One of the main reasons for the investment of €100 million in Heuston Station, for example, is to free up access to the Galway line so that the commuter lines do not interfere with it and, therefore, more services can be provided to Galway city. The Deputy is right that it is not technically in the BMW region, but it is of use to it. Parts of the Kilcock-Kinnegad bypass will not be in the BMW region, but when I go to Galway, I will want to use it. It will, therefore, be of use to the region.</p>

      <b>Ms Shortall</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the fact that infringement proceedings against Ireland are in train by the European Commission arising from the NRA's failure to comply with the requirements of the European and Irish standards EN 1317 in respect of safety barriers on roads and that the breach has continued despite a written undertaking to comply on 7 March 2002, as a consequence of which road users have been deprived of the level of protection decreed by the European Commission as appropriate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_446">It is not correct to imply that safety barriers on our roads are inadequate or that NRA standards or practices constitute a contravention of EU standard EN 1317. I understand from the NRA that, since January 2002, all road improvement contracts involving the provision of safety barriers are tendered exclusively on the basis of the EU standard EN 1317 for safety barriers.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The proceedings to which the Deputy refers related to compliance with EU procurement directives which require that EU product standards, where available, be used exclusively in tender invitations. Prior to January 2002, the NRA had been specifying both the EU standard and a comparable British standard. Following contacts between the Commission, my Department and the NRA, the authority changed its practice in January 2002 to refer exclusively to EN 1317 in tender invitations.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The EN 1317 standard has been adopted by the EU under the construction products directive as part of the EU process of harmonising product standards. It is a performance standard which sets out the testing requirements for different classes of barriers. It does not specify whether or when safety barriers are to be provided. That is a matter for national authorities. The application of EN 1317 does not call into question the adequacy of barriers procured and installed under the arrangements in place prior to January 2002. The barriers concerned comply with best international practice and provide the same level of safety as barriers supplied and installed in response to tenders based on exclusive use of the EN 1317 standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The position on providing median barriers on motorways and dual carriageways is that the NRA's current standards provide for high containment safety barriers in central medians up to 7.5 metres in width and normal containment safety barriers in central medians greater than 7.5 metres in width but not exceeding 15 metres in width. Where median width is greater than 15 metres, the median itself provides the safety mechanism. The NRA has been asked to consider further the position on the retrofitting of safety barriers on existing motorways and dual carriageways where the central reservation is greater than 15 metres.</p>

          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_450">The Minister is confusing two different issues. This is not about the use or otherwise of central barriers but the standards of road barriers in use at the moment. Will the Minister confirm that at a meeting in Brussels in January of last year his Department and the NRA were taken to task by the European Commission for their failure to operate to the procurement requirements regarding the European standard for all road barriers? Given that the NRA, subsequent to that meeting, sent a letter to the European Commission saying that it would in future adhere to the standard required by the Commission in all future procurements, why did the NRA advertise for tenders for a section of the N11 between Newtownmountkennedy and Ballinabarney with a specification for road barriers of British and not European standard? Why was that allowed to happen despite its clear undertaking to the European Commission to comply with the European standard, as it is legally obliged to do?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_451">In March 2001, the EU Commission questioned the NRA practice at the time of specifying both the EU standard, EN 1317, and the existing standard in tenders for road contracts. The issues raised by the Commission were to do with procurement procedures, specifically whether it was in order to tender on the basis of the use of either previously approved barrier types or barriers satisfying EN 1317, or the use of EN 1317-compliant barriers only. The legal advice received by the NRA indicated that it was in order to specify either barrier type under transitional arrangements catered for in the EU guidance documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The Commission's view was that the procurement provisions of the works and supplies directive took precedence and, consequently, tender invitations should refer exclusively to the use of EN 1317-compliant barriers. In January 2002 the NRA informed the Commission that it would operate on that basis from then on. The Deputy is correct in that the Commission queried the NRA's practice. I have given the history of what happened in this regard. There is a question later which refers specifically to the N11 and I must wait until I come to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">All the Minister has done is accept the fact that clarification was sought and it was pointed out to the NRA that it was not in compliance. The letter from the NRA of 7 March 2002 states: "The Authority also confirms—</p>

          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_455">The NRA confirmed in that letter that in future all tendering procedures would comply with the procurement rules laid down in respect of the standard used for roadside barriers. Why was that the case? That was in March of last year. In September of this year the NRA invited tenders for the section of the N11 to which I referred and in that tender document the specification for the barriers was the British standard, not the European one. In effect, this means that drivers on Irish roads are being denied the protection to which they are entitled under EU legislation. Why, in spite of giving that undertaking, does the NRA continue to flout the law in respect of standards? Why is the Minister allowing that to happen? Does he accept that in doing so he is contributing to the loss of lives on our roads because of the failure of the NRA to comply with its legal requirements?</p>

          <p eId="para_456">All I can do to be of assistance is to indicate that the Deputy is correct. It is obvious from what I have said that the NRA felt it was on solid ground up to the time the Commission queried its procedures. It then undertook to operate on the basis of the Commission's interpretation, that future contracts for safety barriers would be tendered exclusively on the basis of the use of EN 1317-compliant barriers.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">. . .  road construction contracts awarded for the Arklow bypass, the Wyatville interchange and the Glen of the Downs and Ashford-Rathnew schemes were awarded prior to January 2002 and had safety barrier provisions based on the previous NRA standard.

      <b>Dr. Cowley</b>
      asked the

      the amount of money which has been invested in the capital building programme for Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock airports; the amounts paid to each airport separately; the way in which he expects Knock International Airport, which is supposed to be accommodated out of the regional airports budget, to provide the same level of service as the other international airports; the way in which he expects Knock Airport to realise its major potential from its 2,300-metre runway; his views on whether the treatment of Knock Airport is in line with the stated Government policy of balanced regional development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_466">Investment in infrastructure at Dublin, Shannon and Cork is funded by Aer Rianta from its own resources and financing arrangements. The expected capital expenditure by the company at each of the airports in 2003 is €19.7 million for Dublin, €2.7 million for Shannon and €21.5 million for Cork. In recognition of the role that the six privately owned regional airports can play in balanced regional development, the programme for Government provides for the continued support of the airports and for air access to the regions in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Knock Airport benefits considerably through a range of direct and indirect funding mechanisms, namely, capital grant assistance towards infrastructural improvements under the BMW regional operational programme of the NDP and the allocation of assistance towards marketing, safety and security expenditure. Since 2001 my Department has allocated approximately €2.4 million towards infrastructure at the airport under the NDP capital measure, of which more than €1.7 million has been paid to the airport to date. A new departure lounge and check-in area have recently been completed with grant aid of €1.3 million. The amount allocated directly to the airport this year towards marketing, safety and security is €400,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Scheduled air services linking Knock Airport with Dublin are subsidised through the public service obligation, PSO, programme. I am currently considering the review of air services supported by the essential air service programme, which was commissioned by the Department in March 2003 under the Government's expenditure review initiative. The review was undertaken by DKM Economic Consultants and was completed in May 2003. I am considering the outcome of this study with a view to determining my future approach to the PSO regime and I will be making decisions on the issue shortly.</p>

Will he agree that in view of the massive buildings in Dublin, Cork and Shannon and the hundreds of millions of euro that have gone into those airports, compared to the amount that has gone into Knock Airport –€1.7 million plus €400,000 for marketing, safety and security, most of which will go towards Aer Arann – this is a small cost to the Government for building and running an airport? Will he not agree that the BMW region cannot possibly compete with the south and east given the small amount of funding for Knock Airport, which is the airport for the region, compared to that given to Cork, Shannon and Dublin? These international airports have been heavily supported over the years through capital and revenue funding. Will the Minister agree that Knock needs proper funding if it is to help develop the BMW area, with its massive potential of millions of visitors?</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I agree with the Deputy's analysis. Knock Airport is in receipt of substantial taxpayers' funding, which it requires, and that will continue. Up to the end of 2002 the airport was showing a profit on its operations and was turning over almost €4 million, which is to its credit. It has a new board, chairperson and management structure and they are to be complimented on the work they are putting into it. The initial support for the airport came in the form of a non-repayable loan and since then substantial funds have been invested in the airport by way of capital grants and public service obligation funding. The Deputy can be assured of the Government's and my continued support for the airport.</p>

Given that so much work has to be done, does the Minister not consider that €25 million in investment is needed to help develop and harvest the potential that exists there? Knock Airport has a massive, international standard runway and €400,000 does not seem like a lot of money for marketing.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_478">The Deputy has to look at it in the context of the existing NDP capital measures 2001-03, under which an allocation of €2.4 million has gone to Knock Airport, with €1.78 million drawn down to date. Major projects have also been supported by way of capital grants. For example, the departure terminal, baggage-screening equipment, state-of-the-art check-in, departure lounge and retail outlet facilities have all been aided.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The public service obligation, the amount paid for the flights, is paid directly to Aer Arann. This airline has a daily return trip to Dublin at an average cost to the Exchequer of approximately €3 million annually. The subvention per passenger per one-way trip is calculated at €226 – this is a substantial investment in the airport. To its credit, the airport is now well-managed and well-led and has a good future.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">Under the relevant EU legislation, there also exists a framework for supporting the provision of air services based on defined public service obligations, PSO. Our PSO regime currently facilitates the operation of air links between Dublin and the regional airports in Kerry, Galway, Sligo, Knock, Donegal and Derry. However, as the Deputy is aware, Exchequer support for the PSO air services is paid to the air carriers concerned and not to the airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I do not believe that the restructuring of the State airports, decided upon by the Government in July last, will have devastating consequences for the regional airports. The new arrangements for the State airports will facilitate greater competition for new business among all Irish airports to the extent permitted by market dynamics. It will, of course, be important to ensure that, as far as possible, a fair competitive environment exists having regard to the scale of operations at the smaller regional airports and to the level of Exchequer support for such airports in the future.</p>

No evaluation has been carried out examining what would happen at regional airports following the break-up of Aer Rianta. However, I understand that a committee is currently considering this. Did the Minister get advice on what the outcome would be for regional airports before he announced the break-up of Aer Rianta? Will he guarantee the House that irrespective of what happens with the break-up of Aer Rianta, the Government can do what it wants as regards providing State support to any or all of the regional airports and will not have to seek approval from the EU?</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_528">As the Deputy will be aware, An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to continue to transform Aer Rianta and, as part of that process, to ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">In July last, the Government decided to establish the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork as fully independent and autonomous authorities under State ownership. It is envisaged that the two new independent airport authorities for Shannon and Cork will both commence business free of debt and that the debts associated with these airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme currently under way at Cork Airport, will remain with Dublin Airport. The desirability of these debt arrangements emerged from my Department's consideration of the financial position of the three State airports within the current Aer Rianta structure, provided to my Department by Aer Rianta.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">PricewaterhouseCoopers assisted my Department in its analysis of the Aer Rianta data and completed the work in March of this year. These debt arrangements will ensure that both Shannon and Cork airports will have sound balance sheets, giving both a fresh start to develop and grow their business. PricewaterhouseCoopers did not express any opinion or conclusions on the financial information supplied by Aer Rianta.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The Minister for Finance has made it clear that he is fully supportive of these restructuring measures. My Department is currently finalising the necessary amending legislation and I will shortly seek Government approval for the publication of the State Airports Bill 2003 to give effect to the Government decision of last July.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_532">Does the Minister accept that if Cork and Shannon are to be stand-alone airports without State aid, it is highly unlikely the regulator will allow the current assistance being given to the regional airports to continue? Is it not the case that PricewaterhouseCoopers found that even with transferring the debts from Cork and Shannon, it is inevitable that if they are to have any chance of surviving they will have to significantly increase their charges? This would hardly attract Ryanair or other low-cost airlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">When the Minister brought the proposals to Cabinet did the Minister for Finance not ask why he was rushing them, given the complexity of the financial and legal issues involved? The Minister has, in the last week, employed consultants to advise him on the complex aspects of the proposal. Why will he not wait until they provide their advice, which they will do some time next summer? Is it not the case that the Minister made up his mind, made an announcement about the future of Aer Rianta and thought about it later? It is only now beginning to dawn on him that the route he has chosen is an exceptionally difficult one and that he may not be able to carry through what he says he intends to do. Given that the Minister has recently employed an army of consultants to advise him on how he can achieve what his proposals are setting out to achieve, why will he not wait until that advice is available before rushing legislation through the House?</p>

          <p eId="para_538">Deputy Shortall suggests that increased charges in Shannon and Cork would come about if they were independent.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_231">

        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_232">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_540">I do not accept that analysis. If one takes the debt out of the PricewaterhouseCoopers' figures, the growth forecasts by Aer Rianta suggest these airports can at worst break even and at best make substantial funds. Most airports around the world that have more than 2 million passengers are profitable. With well over 2 million passengers in both cases there is no reason these two airports should not be profitable. There should be no need to increase charges excessively. The level of charges will be a matter for judgment. Even if we make no changes, the general view is that charges are not high by international standards and I accept that. However, charging is a neutral issue, whatever the structure of the airports. It applies whether or not my policy is put into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In the menu which has come into the possession of the Deputy's party, the Minister for Finance fully supports the restructuring proposal. He made that clear. He has asked that we deal with debt, pension and projection issues and issues to do with bonds. I support him in that. These are all normal business issues and can be fully dealt with. That is why I have the consultants helping me to sort them out, and we will do so. We are making good solid progress in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I do not propose to wait for the consultants and hold back the legislation in that context. We will move at a steady pace. I will not rush matters but I will make sure the House has the Bill as soon as I have it. We will unravel as many of these technical financial issues as we can before the Bill is published. Provided we lay out how it is to be done, others can be unravelled after autonomy has been put in place. The new boards can work on those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">It has not just dawned on me that this is a complicated business. I know it is complicated but I am committed to pressing ahead with it all speed. I visited Shannon recently. There is fantastic enthusiasm in the region for the new board which I nominated. Most of the agencies there are extraordinarily enthusiastic. I have addressed many groups in the Shannon region in recent weeks. There is nothing but enthusiasm and excitement about the autonomy. The same is true of the Cork region. It is clear from my discussions that there is substantial excitement there. I look forward to Cork and Shannon having the freedom to develop their airports with the support of all of us in this House. I know we all wish them well.</p>

          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_544">Is the Minister for Finance not right to be concerned and to express severe reservations? As the shareholder he is the one who is likely to end up in the High Court when the legal difficulties associated with the Minister's proposals are being dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The Minister has employed three teams of consultants in the past couple of weeks to advise him on what he is trying to achieve. What have they cost? The Minister still has not explained why he will not wait for that expensive advice before he drafts the legislation. Perhaps he is rethinking that, now that he realises how complex it is.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_558">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 6 and 44 together. As I said in the Dáil on 9 October last, no decision on any type of sale transaction for Aer Lingus, or on the timing of a transaction, has been taken by Government. It is now over six years since the Government first decided to explore the ownership issue which led to the decision in 1999 to embark on an IPO of the airline. Since the cancellation of that planned IPO, the necessary focus by the board and staff of Aer Lingus has been, first, on the implementation of the survival plan and, more recently, on building on the progress made. I have taken the view since coming into office that the company needed to continue that focus on positioning the airline so that it can compete successfully and grow profitably. This it has done and is continuing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">It was in this context and taking account of progress in the repositioning of the airline that last July, I asked the chairman to examine and report back to me on future options for the company. The chairman recently supplied me with his report. The company's view is that a private sector investment process should be initiated without delay. I am currently giving careful consideration to the report and I will be bringing the Aer Lingus views, together with my own position, to Cabinet in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_560">The Minister does not seem to have thought out any of this matter. He speaks of private sector involvement. Does this mean a minority or majority stake or the complete sale of the company? Could the Minister give an outline of his thinking on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Was any mention made in the report the Minister received from the company of the critical slots at Heathrow Airport, which are an economic asset to the country and not just to the company and which have been purchased by the Irish taxpayers over a number of years of subvention?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_562">The report which the chairman has given me goes through a number of the options open to the company. These include whether the company should stay in public or private ownership, possible private placements to institutions, IPOs and trade sales. The Deputy will be aware that an Aer Lingus Bill is before the House at present, which will authorise the Government to proceed with taking private sector investment in the airline.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I agree that the slots at Heathrow would be a critical part of any consideration to change the status of the airline from public to private. I take the view that change is probably inevitable. The ESOP now provides the employee shareholders with a 14.9% stake in the company. It is necessary to look at the strategic future of the airline and how we can provide it with equity injections and capital funding in the future and at where it is best placed so that it can grow. I take a very pragmatic view of the future of Aer Lingus and I will come to a conclusion on that question shortly.</p>

In his speech on the Bill, the Minister stated that such a shareholding would be offered only where the company, or part thereof, was for sale or in other exceptional circumstances. Maybe there is another exceptional circumstance that led him to offer 14.9% to employees. If so, what is it?</p>
          <p eId="para_567">I was interested in the Minister's key comment that change is inevitable. He proceeded to refer to strategic issues regarding the raising of capital.

          <p eId="para_569">The Minister said in his speech on the Bill that he would only offer up to 14.9% of the shareholding in the company to employees in exceptional circumstances, such as the sale of the company.

          <p eId="para_570">The employee share ownership plan increased the employees' shareholding from 4.7% to 14.9%. This was done in turn for their commitment to the rescue procedure of Aer Lingus, the recent changes thereto and the changed management programme. It was negotiated some time ago. I believe the Deputy is referring to my statement that if we were to move the airline into the private sector or accept private sector funding, we could not offer more than 14.9%. I am fairly sure my script dealt with this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">I do not make any apologies for considering options. Aer Lingus is a major national asset and has served the nation well for many generations. It is incumbent on all of us to work out its future properly. The options are that the company will stay in State ownership or take in private sector investment. The chairman has indicated to me in his report that it is the company's view that a private sector investment process should be started without delay. If this is the view of the company, it is therefore incumbent on me to consider it seriously.</p>

However, it was clear from backbenchers on the Government side that they did not believe change was inevitable. Rather, they believed it was inadvisable.

I have made it clear that I will consider what the chairman said on behalf of the company in the report and the current position of the airline. I will discuss these issues with my Cabinet colleagues and come to a view on the best route forward for the airline. We could have a big debate on this subject today but I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not permit it.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">This is the best time for the airline to consider its future role because it is now doing well. It has turned the corner and is performing solidly. This is the time for us to consider, with the airline's senior and very talented management, the future of the airline and its shareholders, including the worker shareholders.</p>

          <p eId="para_581">Is it not the case that the proposals of the employee share ownership plan were only used as a cloak to give the Minister and the Minister for Finance a free hand to do with the company whatever they wished? We are concerned about the Minister's statement that he has not adopted a position on this matter. As has been the case in respect of so many announcements he has made, he does not have a view and leaves matters in free-fall. Given the budgetary pressures that resulted from the Government's mismanagement of the economy in recent years, the Minister expects us to approve giving him a free hand to sell off Aer Lingus completely or to sell off the family silver to help the Minister for Finance bolster the financial and budgetary position.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">On the basis of the Minister's discussions with senior management, what does he regard to be best for Aer Lingus? He has not told us anything about his views on that aspect. We know senior management is putting on pressure to privatise, for obvious reasons. Given the strategic role Aer Lingus plays in industry and tourism and in terms of our being an island nation, what is the Minister's view on the role Aer Lingus should be playing?</p>

      the position on the future of Aer Rianta, its operation at Dublin Airport and the other airports throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [28040/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_302">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_635">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 11, 24, 55 to 57, inclusive, 59, 65, 75, 175 and 194 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">An Agreed Programme for Government included a commitment to continue to transform Aer Rianta and, as part of that process, to ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence. In July last, the Government decided to establish the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork as fully independent and autonomous authorities under State ownership and I am now charged with implementing that decision. I will shortly seek Government approval for the publication of the necessary amending legislation to give effect to this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Last month, I announced the full membership of the new board designate for Shannon Airport and I expect to be in a position shortly to announce the full boards for the new Cork and Dublin airport authorities. It is hoped that the three new State airport companies will be up and running on a statutory basis as early as possible next year. There has been a broad level of support for the Government's decision to establish the three airports as fully autonomous authorities under State ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The new arrangements are designed to strengthen and expand each of the three airports and, in particular, to give both Shannon and Cork airports a fresh start under strong and visionary leadership. All three airports can perform even better than they have to date and, through more focused commercial operation, each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional economic activity to the benefit of its customers, both airlines and passengers, as well as tourism, trade and industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The restructuring of Aer Rianta is a strategic decision which is in the best interests of the three State airports. The new boards designate for the three airports will work with the current Aer Rianta board and the Department on all issues involved in bringing about the transition to independent and autonomous authorities for Dublin, Shannon and Cork. My Department will continue to consult the representatives of the Aer Rianta unions as the implementation of the Government decision proceeds.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">It is envisaged that the two new independent airport authorities for Shannon and Cork will both commence business free of debt and that the debts associated with these airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme at Cork Airport, will remain with Dublin Airport. In conjunction with Aer Rianta, my Department is giving urgent attention to the options for giving effect to the establishment of the three new airport authorities, including the optimum mechanisms for allocating airport assets among the three airports. These arrangements will ensure that the new airport companies at Shannon and Cork will have sound balance sheets, giving both of them a fresh start to develop and grow their business at a pace even greater than they have achieved in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I am also giving detailed consideration to the implications for Dublin Airport of absorbing the debt of Shannon and Cork airports as currently envisaged. In this regard, the issue of other significant assets of the Aer Rianta Group such as the Great Southern Hotels and Aer Rianta International is being carefully examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">As I stated in response to a separate question today, having consulted Aer Rianta, I have made the contents of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report available to an economist nominated by the Aer Rianta unions. This was done on the understanding that the report continues to be commercially sensitive and is not for general release, and in order that the economist concerned would be enabled to brief senior trade union officials appropriately on the contents of the report.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_643">In case the Minister throws the issue back at me, I make clear that the Fine Gael Party agrees with the decision to establish three independent boards for Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports. Is the Minister not, as in the case of Aer Lingus, making up policy as he goes along? How does he envisage Dublin Airport competing with an independent terminal if it is encumbered with debt? What will be the mandated criteria for the three airports regarding profit? Will they have to break even or are they expected to make returns to the Exchequer? Has the Minister presented to the European Commission any of his proposals on establishing three independent boards? Will the State provide subvention for capital investments required at the three airports and secure their loans? I ask the Minister to provide for Members greater detail on his proposals.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_644">I appreciate the Deputy's expression of support in principle for the proposal, while acknowledging that he has genuine questions and concerns about its implementation and mechanics. We are working through these issues as best we can with the board of Aer Rianta, employees of the company and the Department of Finance, and I am confident we will resolve them at an early date.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The mandate given to the airports will be that they will have to operate commercially, which is the current mandate of the boards of Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and other State companies. A provision to this effect, similar to one in the current legislation on Aer Rianta, will be included in the new legislation. I did not formally consult the European Union on the proposals because this restructuring decision comes within the competence of the Government rather than the Commission.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_306">

        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_648">The Minister stated that the policy was based on a strategic decision taken by the Government. What are the strategic advantages or benefits of restructuring and what strategic change is the Government hoping to achieve? Once the debts of Cork and Shannon airports have been transferred to Dublin Airport, what will be the gearing ratio of Dublin Airport? Will the burden of its debt affect the company's operations in terms of further investment decisions?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_649">With regard to strategic thinking, the three airports, in particular Cork and Shannon airports, were established originally as drivers of economic growth in their respective regions. Over a long period, they became more centralised and were managed in Dublin, effectively creating an airport monopoly in strategic international airport terms. Combined, they had about 97% of business. The fundamental strategic thinking behind the decision was that by returning authority to Shannon and Cork airports, the airports would develop their respective regions in a dynamic manner and harness the leadership and vision in those regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I would be happy to deal in facts and figures on these issues. However, much more important than an accountancy assessment of the strengths of the balance sheets involved is an assessment of the determination and pride of the people in the regions. They desperately want to make these airports into what they could have been, namely, major strategic regional assets for stimulating growth in the regions. That is their <i>raison d'être.</i>The final debt position has been worked out among the airports. With Aer Rianta predicting an increase in passenger turnover at Dublin Airport from 15 million to 30 million over the next 20 years, I am confident the company will be in a position easily to handle the debt. Deputies should also note that even if I did not touch Aer Rianta, the debt would still remain with Dublin Airport.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_309">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_651">Pardon me.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_652">The reality is that the debt of the Aer Rianta Group is effectively a burden for Dublin airport because Cork and Shannon airports would not be able to handle it. Regardless of whether one decides to restructure the company or leave it as it is, the repayment of the company's debts always depended on the future growth of Dublin Airport. By all accounts, it has an exciting future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_653">Surely the Minister is also seeking to increase passenger throughput in Cork and Shannon airports. If this is the case, clearly part of the debt should be assumed by those two airports, rather than Dublin Airport alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The Minister explained the strategic thinking behind his decision. The confusing issue for the public is that the company in question is profitable. Aer Rianta recorded an increase in profits of 300% during a period in which other companies in the aviation industry were going to the wall following the events of 11 September 2001. For some reason the Minister wants to break up a profitable company. Why? He stated that the decision was taken for strategic reasons. Was it based on reports? One can quote various reports, but one of them, the Warburg Dillon Reid report commissioned in 1999, concluded decisively that Aer Rianta should not be broken up on the grounds of economic, strategic and national interests. What has changed to persuade the Minister to engage in what some people would consider ideological vandalism? He may claim to be neutral on privatisation but his actions appear to speak louder than his words.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Will the Minister outline the thinking behind this matter? The Taoiseach said there was a number of reports. Are they reports from the chamber of commerce in Shannon or the local Fianna Fáil cumann in Cork? Where do the reports originate that suggest this is the way forward for Aer Rianta? Anybody who has examined this matter has pointed out that this enterprise is working well. Some people argue that State companies never work but it is clear that this company is working well and is profitable. The Minister wants to tinker with this. Is he working on the basis of a hunch that it will work? What are the economic arguments for it? What consultants' reports are influencing the Minister?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_656">I could get involved in a debate with the Deputy about profit and loss and the financial health of Aer Rianta. I am bombarded by opposing arguments on this issue. When I meet the trade union movement I am told that it is a highly profitable company and am asked why I am touching it. However, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report says that Shannon and Cork Airports are not viable and that Dublin Airport cannot carry the debt it has. It says that Aer Rianta is not particularly profitable, especially in its core business, and has substantial debts. The company has grown traffic enormously, and all credit to it for that, but its profitability is minuscule compared with the growth in traffic it has generated.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I am not sure which argument I should accept. People who are looking at the same set of figures are arriving at two different conclusions. One is that the company is highly profitable and a rising star. The other, the PricewaterhouseCoopers view, is that there is too much financial pressure on the company, the airports cannot stand alone and that Dublin Airport cannot carry the debt. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Aer Rianta has made substantial funds on its ancillary investments but the return on capital in its core business is, arguably, not as strong as it should be when international comparisons are made. That is likely to be closer to the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I did not ask the consultants to advise me on what the policy should be. The policy was outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government and it is that the Government will give greater autonomy to Shannon and Cork Airports. There are many reports. There is the Warburg Dillon Read AIB Capital Marketing report of December 1999, the famous Doganis report of January 2002 and the PricewaterhouseCoopers document we have discussed. I have received submissions from approximately 40 regional groups and I have discussed this with Aer Rianta, the trade unions, local groups and interested parties throughout the country. The programme for Government indicated this policy, which is based on our confidence in the regions. That is the strategic thinking behind this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_659">Is it not the case that the real game plan is to destroy Aer Rianta and Dublin Airport? The Minister could have achieved a strong future for Cork and Shannon by establishing separate boards at those airports with separate marketing strategies. He could have helped Shannon by providing decent rail access to the airport, which is the airport's biggest problem at present. He could have done all this within the Aer Rianta company. Instead, he targeted the operation at Dublin Airport. He intends to lumber it with serious debt, to strip it of its assets and to destroy its credit rating. Is it not the case that the reason for doing that is to clear the way for private sector operators who want a share of the action at Dublin Airport?</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Last week, when the Minister came under pressure about his plans for Shannon when the PWC report was quoted as showing that Shannon Airport did not have a future and could not make an operating profit with the current figures, he said he was thinking of transferring Aer Rianta International to Shannon. What is the status of his thinking in that regard? Has he sought legal advice on it? What is that advice? Who are the three teams of consultants the Minister recently appointed to advise him and can he give an estimate of the cost of those consultancies?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_661">I am not seeking to destroy Dublin Airport. I have a fundamentally different view from the Deputy on these matters. I am not an admirer of monopolies—</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_663">—and I have made that clear. I have no hidden agenda. The Deputy's party has long been a supporter of monopolies and I understand that position. I hope the Irish people understand it. However, I am not in that corner.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_664">There are some natural monopolies.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_665">I am a strong supporter of regional autonomy and giving people in the west and south the type of authority and support they need to develop their airports. The Deputy and I can agree to differ on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The Deputy suggested that the hidden agenda was private sector investment in the airport. That is ironic because I am doing the opposite. I am keeping the airports in State ownership. I have correspondence from the board of Aer Rianta which suggested that private sector investment, of up to €1 billion, should be accepted in the airport. This occurred about a year ago. The suggestion from the board was that I sell up to one third of Aer Rianta, after which, no doubt, the rest of it would go.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_668">I opposed that proposition. Ironically, in years to come the trade union movement might, instead of castigating me about this along with the Deputy and the Labour Party, look again at what would have happened if I did not take this course. Almost certainly, the pressure to sell a share and put Aer Rianta into an IPO for purchase by the big companies in Europe would have resulted in the airports ending up in private hands.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">The Deputy says that Shannon Airport cannot make a profit. I have been there many times recently. The people there are determined to do so. My faith in that board, the region and the people is enormous.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">I hope Steer Davies Gleave does a better job on its figures than it did on the last report it produced. With regard to Dublin Airport and the debt it will have of approximately €400 million, how does that balance with a competing terminal in Dublin and what will its economic impact be on the repayment of the debt that will be accrued from both Shannon and Cork? What capital funds will be made available or will the Government provide security for loans at both Shannon and Cork? Significant capital investment is required, especially for the runway at Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Why did the Minister not dispel the claims emanating from the PricewaterhouseCoopers report if they are inaccurate? It is imperative that he should put everything on the table to clarify the issues. Will the Minister guarantee that he will have a firm mind on these issues prior to bringing legislation to this House, unlike what happened with the Aer Lingus Bill?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_687">The issue of the second terminal will be back before the Government in the coming weeks. The Deputy is correct to refer to it. We must carefully assess the economic implications of a second terminal proposal in the context of a Dublin Airport authority. My view is clear. I am in favour of proceeding with a second terminal. The Cabinet will discuss the issue in the coming weeks. It is interlinked with the future of the airport and I would like to have an opportunity to discuss the matter with the new Dublin Airport authority as soon as it takes office.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">On the question of investment in Shannon Airport, including removing the €70 million debt currently ascribed to it and giving it a clean balance sheet, given that, on the figures available, the airport caters for passenger numbers in excess of 2.2 billion it will be able to generate sufficient funds to keep its capital investment going. On the security of the debts, whatever is in the present Aer Rianta legislation will be replicated for each of the three airports.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_351">
          <from>Mr. Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_706">I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute briefly to what has been a lengthy and interesting debate on this Bill. As stated by many Members, the legislation is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">In reviewing the debate that has taken place so far, it is clear the Bill is being considered and debated in the overall context of the Government's successful housing programme. I come from a similar background to many Members of the House where, on a day-to-day basis, I deal with housing issues and the concerns of people seeking local authority housing or private rented accommodation, including issues relating to the management of local authority properties or estates and tenant-landlord conflicts.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">It has become clear to me over the years – I would say it is my political priority – that providing good quality secure accommodation for individuals ensures they are in the best position to maximise their educational, health and employment prospects and potential. There can be no disputing the fact that those who enjoy the benefit of good quality, secure and affordable housing are more likely to be able to participate fully in the education system, and move on to long-term employment, while at the same time experiencing a better overall level of personal health.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Coming from that point of view, I am particularly happy to acknowledge the success of the Government's housing policy where supply is seen as the key element in solving the problems that exist. We can philosophise as much as we like, but the demand can only be met by building houses. The record level of output in recent years, which is likely to be exceeded again this year, is genuinely impressive. It means the target of 600,000 dwellings to meet an anticipated 10-year demand is well on the way to being achieved, and earlier than when the target was first set by the Government in 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Government continues to put a heavy emphasis on the provision of social and affordable housing. The range of measures aimed at meeting the needs of those on low incomes has been greatly expanded. I am sure Deputy Durkan will agree that our local authority, Kildare County Council, has, to say the least, been tardy in delivering its own housing programme or significant numbers of affordable housing units.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_711">The Deputy never said a truer word.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Mr. Ó Fearghaíl</from>
          <p eId="para_712">People aspiring to owning their own houses in Kildare have received an enormous welcome boost with the Government's decision to make lands at Magee Barracks available for affordable housing under the terms of Sustaining Progress. The €1.7 billion allocated towards capital funding for houses in 2003 is intended to deliver 13,000 units of social and affordable housing throughout the country. Output from the voluntary sector is also high, with more than 700 units of accommodation completed in the first six months of this year. Despite some difficulties with the shared ownership scheme, almost 5,500 families have availed of it over the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Homelessness is a very serious issue, perhaps the most serious housing issue confronting us. The Government is committed to tackling the problem. Throughout the country local authorities, together with health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, have come together to draw up local homeless action plans, which are currently in the process of being implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">However, most action is required in Dublin. I note from a response to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy O'Connor, on the issue of homelessness in Dublin, that in the three year period 2001-03, almost 1,500 persons will have been housed by the local authority, voluntary sector and the Threshold housing access unit in the four Dublin local authority areas. In addition, 1,000 emergency beds have been provided and a range of strategies have been put in place, involving the health boards and the Probation and Welfare Service, to address the needs of those leaving hospitals and mental heath facilities and homeless offenders. Much has been done and much more is in the process of being done. In that context, with much activity in the housing area it is appropriate that the private rented sector be studied and regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Traditionally, we have placed a high value on home ownership. As we rapidly become a multi-cultural society it is inevitable that rental accommodation will meet the needs of an ever increasing proportion of the population. For too long, rental property has been viewed as a stop-gap measure meeting short-term needs, filling the gap between leaving the family home and either purchasing one's own accommodation or moving to local authority provided accommodation. It is essential in this changing environment that people have the choice to opt for rental accommodation as a means of meeting their ongoing housing needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The Bill seeks to strike a balance between the interests of tenant and landlord and their particular rights and responsibilities. That there has been a widespread welcome for it and the principle it contains is proof that the Minister has got the balance right. Like other speakers, I have had representations from both sides of the argument in respect of the proposed six-month probationary period, with landlords suggesting the period be extended to 12 months and, unsurprisingly, tenant interest groups suggesting a three month initial period. Common sense would suggest that the six month period proposed strikes the correct balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The word "balance" frequently comes to mind when studying this legislation, not least in the matter of the residential tenancies board and its proposed tenancy tribunal. In almost 20 years as an active public representative and having witnessed many landlord-tenant disputes in my constituency, I recall no case where the tenant proceeded to take court action against a landlord, though in some cases such action might have been justified. The process envisaged in the Bill whereby disputes may be referred to the board for mediation or adjudication or, subsequently, for public hearing by the tenancy tribunal is one that will readily be availed of by tenants and landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">That the Bill sets out the minimum legal obligations of landlords and tenants and addresses in a straightforward manner the important issues of maintenance and repair, deposits and anti-social behaviour is welcome. These are areas around which most difficulty has focused in the past. It is appropriate that the Bill gives recourse to third parties to make a case to the private residential tenancies board.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">We are all aware of the extent to which a minority of unreasonable and irresponsible tenants can make, and have made life difficult for their neighbours. Recently, a newly married couple in my constituency fled their dream home because they could no longer tolerate the antics of a number of people renting an adjacent property. In this case, approaches to the absentee landlord, the Garda and the local authorities failed to resolve the problem. Under the provisions of the Bill, such third parties would have recourse to the private residential tenancies board which in turn could make a determination in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Another major aspect of the Bill is that it provides security of tenure for the tenant for four years while allowing the landlord the option to terminate the tenancy within six months, without giving a reason, but restricting the landlord to ending the tenancy in limited and verifiable circumstances thereafter. In that respect it is reasonable to provide for the ending of a tenancy in the identified circumstances – sale, change of use, major refurbishment or to meet the needs of a family member – provided that in each such case the facts are clearly demonstrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">It has to be acknowledged there is a major improvement in the quality of accommodation available for rent in recent years with an ongoing increase in the number of purpose built units throughout the country. It is still the case that a minority of tenants continue to live in totally unfit accommodation. In many cases – Kildare is no exception – these tenancies are being subvented by the local community welfare officer. It is essential that there is co-ordination in the future between the community welfare service and the proposed private residential tenancies board to ensure rental subsidy is not paid in respect of properties that could be deemed to be unfit or properties with no planning permission. This legislation is likely to lead to a more professional approach to the rental market, which in turn will generate a better environment for tenants, enhanced property standards and an increased investment in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">While I support the Bill I am disappointed it has been found necessary to bring it forward. It is an inescapable fact that if local authorities had taken seriously their responsibilities under existing legislation in the area of registration and enforcement, the additional provisions of the Bill could have been delegated to them for implementation and the need to establish yet another State body could have been avoided. In my county, one of the fastest growing in the country, and one in which NUI Maynooth is located, a mere 580 landlords have registered just 696 properties, a fraction of the overall rental units in the county. Given that there is no full-time staff commitment within Kildare County Council dedicated to registration or enforcement of current legislation, this low figure is not surprising.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">This is well balanced and well crafted legislation and I commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_354">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_724">Those of us who have been involved in politics for some time agree that the Bill strikes a reasonable balance between the landlord and the tenant. As many of my colleagues have said, it has been meandering its way through the House for a long time this year. There will always be a conflict of interest between the tenant and the landlord. It has always been that way. The Minister is trying to provide defined rules in legislation which both sides will understand and try to work towards.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">When introducing the Bill in June, the Minister said it was historic, groundbreaking and so on. I would not go that far. I would prefer if the Minister had devoted more of his time to ensuring young people got an opportunity to own their house. That would resonate much better with them. However, that is not an issue for today but we will return it because we must consider this matter in its totality.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The vast majority of people rent accommodation because they have no alternative, although in certain case, those on middle or higher incomes may chose to rent. Particularly in recent years, more people have wanted to rent than there were units to rent. If there are more buyers than sellers the market becomes distorted. This applies to all transactions, whether it be for flats, rented accommodation, apples, sausages or cattle. That is a law of business and it is there regardless of what one does.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">In the university cities, such as Galway in my area, or Maynooth, or others, in August and September of every year when youngsters are going back to college and the first years are starting out they and their parents must endure no end of torture in seeking accommodation, apart from the financial implications. Like everything else in this world there are bad landlords, who are always in trouble – they are in a minority but they exist. The same is true of tenants, some of whom never improve even if they live to the age of 90. Thankfully, between those extremes most people get on with the job and manage to work out a way of life. Most people, however, would not rent if they had an alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">When I hear the glowing tributes which the Minister of State paid to himself in his opening remarks, as Ministers and Ministers of State always seem to do, I have to set them against the recent Book of Estimates. I wonder if the Minister of State were writing his speech today would it be as it is here now. In the Book of Estimates a new hand grenade is being thrown into the rental accommodation area with the withholding of rent relief for the first six months. That will have a profound effect on a large group of people and it will cause serious trouble. No one would deny that there will always be people who will try to circumvent or dodge an issue, and some who are not entitled to it will receive rent relief, there is no question about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I assume the Minister's backbenchers will bring the word back to him that this will hit innocent and deserving people. Community welfare officers will have a most unenviable job because from what I see of the regulation they will have to be judge and jury without precise regulations as to how they operate. In the context of this Bill that is as serious an issue as has come up in this category for a long time. I hope that over the next month or two it will be refined somewhat because it is crude. I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, on radio recently and in so far as he canvassed with us here his heart is in the job. He comes from the right family and the right area, in the middle of Dublin city where housing problems are more acute than in areas outside Dublin. Irrespective of how often one announces that 50,000 or 52,000 houses were built last year or promises to do the same again, it is not worth a fig to the 60,000 people, and more, who are on the housing waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">I was a member of a local authority for many years until recently and, like everyone else here, as a public representative I have a great deal to do with housing and have seen dramatic changes even in the past five or six years. I do not understand why Fianna Fáil decided to discontinue the first-time buyer's grant a year ago. I thought the party would be too smart from an electoral point of view to do such a thing. Some members of Fianna Fáil argued that €3,600 was a negligible amount in the context of a house costing €200,000. They also argued that when the grant was in place builders added it to the price of a new house. When the budget was announced there was a 1% VAT increase on building material and that was a major blow to young people. However, that was nothing to what is happening now as local authorities seek development contributions. The Minister of State and his colleagues tell us not to blame the Government for that. They say that the local authority is exercising its capacity to raise funds locally. That is hogwash and the Minister of State knows it as well as I do. In effect this is asking the local authority to carry out the capital programme which the Government previously had to fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">As a result of lack of funding from the Exchequer for work the Government should have been doing, several of my constituents who are trying to build or buy their first homes will now, in County Galway, have to pay €13,000 or €14,000 on top of that. This is instead of receiving €3,600 as they would have done a year ago. Regardless of what the ESRI, various building societies and the plethora of monthly housing reports say, house prices are rising, maybe not as steeply as hitherto. When one is trying to save to buy a house, even for as little as €140,000 or €150,000, the 10% increase, even if that is a lesser increase than the year before, makes a difference. Then the Government comes along and puts another €14,000 on top of that. The Minister of State can massage the figures but he will be crucified in every county council chamber around the country.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_733">It is the same racket that Fianna Fáil tried in 1977 but it will not work this time because all people have to do is compare what happened this day last year with what is happening now. They will ask why they had to pay so much more in terms of a development contribution. They will not say that the manager of Galway County Council caused it – it was not because he was put into a financial straitjacket. Even the Fianna Fáil councillors around the country, of which there are many, particularly those in control of county councils, will try to devise a formula of words to enable them to pass the Estimates with some honour, which they will not be able to do. Many more people will tell the Minister of State the same story. Deep down he knows it is true and it is a sleight of hand. Whatever the Minister of State says the young people will know that the responsibility for this lies with central Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">There are many problems in so far as this Bill is concerned, for example, the provision for the first six-month period which allows the landlord to break the tenancy. I assume there have to be compelling reasons and that the landlord could not do this willy nilly. I am not an expert on the Landlord and Tenant Act but does the tenant have to leave after four years unless a new tenancy is agreed? Does he or she have no hold on that property? I cannot find an answer to that in the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_738">I understand. As for landlords, I have no particular interest in bashing them at all. They are important players in all of this. There have been very good landlords over the years and landlords who should never have been allowed to make a penny in that business because they exploited tenants thoroughly. As for standards, which is a very important aspect, I hope this new Bill will get across to all local authorities and to landlords and tenants alike that from now on there must be a certain standard of accommodation below which a tenant will not have to accept. I know tenants who live in dreadful conditions. One would not expect to see a human being in them. I hope that as a result of the publicity this Bill will get and the powers that are in it, it will empower local authorities or health boards or whoever else is involved to do what they should do. It is very important that there is a supervisory role for the authorities to ensure that the standard is met.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">There is another aspect to housing. Some 95% of tenants who talk to me say they regard every pound spent on rent as money down the drain. They say they are housed for whatever week is in it, but that it does them no good for the future. That is a fact of life. The problem is a vicious circle well known to the Minister for State. As the years go by and rates for tenants rise, there is hardly any money left for young people trying to put a few quid together for a house deposit. Then, because of demographics, there are a lot more people to be housed over the years. I will grant that to the Minister of State. It was true that we built more houses, but given the set of circumstances, we have never had more people looking for houses. The circle goes around and around.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">I have a question for the Minister of State, to which he might refer when he is summing up. I happen to be an advocate of the affordable housing concept. When it was first introduced I could see it had a lot to offer. We use it reasonably well in Galway, though not to the extent I thought it would be. Indeed it is not used anywhere to the extent that five or six years ago I thought it would be. That scheme is the vehicle or conduit by which most young people will one day get into a house they can call their own. Why is it not happening?</p>
          <p eId="para_741">In my little village of Mountbellew we have seven or eight affordable housing units. They were built in jig time and sold. We will not go into all that. The cost of the land was low. I then noticed in the last couple of years in small places like Portumna and maybe Ballinasloe that the subsidy paid by the Minister of State's Department was called into question in some instances. For instance, we were told that the houses could be sold at about €120,000, that the Government subsidy should not be scorned and that the houses were cheap. That is of little use to a lot of people on very low incomes not much higher than the social welfare allowance. When one lives in a place like that, one's options are very limited. One cannot go anywhere else. Most of the time there is no rented accommodation.</p>

A loan of €120,000 or €125,000, a figure which I appreciate is very low in the Dublin context, can in many parts of rural Ireland be a huge amount to find for someone who has not got the resources to borrow it. The Minister of State needs to look again at the way this kicks in. If we could manage to house people in units costing €120,000, €125,000 or €140,000—</p>

One is that Galway County Council or some other council will have to build them houses. We are talking of a minimum cost of €150,000. That is the cost today of building a council house. If that is not possible, and it is not, because we have about 1,200 or 1,300 people on the Galway housing list, their only other option is to start renting. That is no use to most of those people.

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_751">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, on his thoughtful and careful stewardship of this issue through the House. I congratulate him too for the strong role he has played on the social democratic side of our party and its movement. He has always stressed this kind of issue as being very important, because this Bill essentially protects tenants from ruthless or heartless landlords. Such people have been an unfortunate tradition in this country, and it is mainly our own people who have to a certain extent been preying on tenants rather than providing for them and providing the kind of accommodation they richly deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">It is important that this Bill has finally come through the legislative pipeline and is now becoming a reality. For many years we were lacklustre in our performance in this area. We left tenants abandoned to what in certain cases, a minority of cases, turned out to be rapacious landlords who had no regard for health, safety or indeed the situation of a tenant hard pressed for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">This is balanced legislation. It balances the rights of the tenant with those of the landlord. I have never been a landlord, and I do not have much sympathy for that class of person, but the landlord has a role to play in providing housing in this country. Housing supply, as identified by Deputy Connaughton, is a very important issue. With this Bill we are starting on a great new venture which reflects the modernity of our country and our coming to terms with the fact that we are not in Thatcherite terms a Government or economy or a country which is aspiring to force everyone into becoming a home owner.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I was struck by Deputy Connaughton's suggestion that it is a tragedy that someone would never end up owning his or her own home. The reality of most modern economies outside Ireland, on the Continent and elsewhere, is that a great many people survive in rented dwellings. There are very strong economic arguments for having a strong rental market and a substantial percentage of the population depending on rented rather than purchased accommodation. This is a very desirable situation which the Minister of State referred to in one of his speeches on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Considering the mobility of labour, there are strong economic arguments to suggest that people should not own their own homes, or that if they do, they should not be overly dependent financially on a mortgage. If one is dependent in that way, one is unable to move or be mobile when the economy changes and requires mobility of labour, in terms of moving to one part of the country or another. That is very important for the ongoing development of this economy, not least because we are now embarking on a programme of decentralisation. We have to be able to provide for a situation where people of a certain age or disposition can move from Dublin to Galway, Mayo, Leitrim or wherever when they wish to do so, and allow them to do so without any punitive measures or financial discouragement.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Bill provides for that and for the basic decency and security which a tenant deserves. The four-year provision is to be applauded and it is balanced by the six-month probationary period which the tenant must serve at the beginning of a tenancy. Other fair measures in the Bill include the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board which will hear appeals in the case of disputes between landlord and tenant. The law will be applied in a full and fair manner and all will be treated equally. Those who breach the spirit of the Bill will be punished, and rightly so. I am impressed by the significant financial punishment that would apply for an unscrupulous landlord who would invoke one of the four or five criteria that apply for ending a tenancy of a tenant who may be vulnerable. There is provision for fines of up to €20,000 where a tenant is evicted by a landlord who claims one of the four criteria, for instance that a member of the family requires the accommodation or that the property is to be sold. If there is a material deceit or abuse of the law in that case, a significant penalty applies and that is to be welcomed. That penalty will, I hope, banish the rackrenting, ruthless landlords who have been evident in this marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Approximately 11% or 12% of the housed population is dependent on rented accommodation. In Germany the figure is approximately 30% which is very high in European terms. I suspect that in the coming years in Ireland there will be a gradual but steady climb in the number of people who do not own their home, and perhaps happily so. They may regard it as more desirable to rent rather than own their home and would prefer not to make the significant financial commitment of a mortgage, which is binding.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">A recent report stated that overseas firms are arranging packages where money is pooled for mortgages. Deputy Connaughton was rather emotional in his appeal for everyone to own their own home. When the maturing and developing mortgage market is examined it may be the case that many people will buy their own homes but never actually own them because the financial institutions will take a much greater share in the housing property market. The more prolonged mortgage will mean people will never own their own home in the pure sense of ownership as in having it as an asset which they can liquidate and encash in its entirety. This is a welcome development in some ways because it means that the level of cash being paid into a mortgage or rent can be reduced because of the prolonged rental or mortgage agreement. It means that capital is not being wasted or buried in a house, in bricks and mortar. There are compelling arguments for encouraging more people to take a more diverse investment approach to their financial future, such as stocks and shares, equities, pension funds, life or medical insurance. These methods are better for the individual because they will have greater security in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">It is important that this is stated because in the past the argument of rent versus ownership has been very emotive. It is not always the case that ownership is the best for society in general. I was particularly struck by the rhetoric employed by Mrs. Thatcher in this regard when I lived in rented accommodation in England. She went on lyrical forays to praise the benefits conferred by home ownership. I am not as convinced as she seemed to imply that it confers significant benefits. There is no doubt that it has a steadying influence on society but there is a point where an obsession with home ownership becomes a sterile and conservative influence on a society. It can breed a form of conservatism and an unwillingness to consider other investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">I am a member of a Government which has a social, caring and democratic edge and it has had the courage to reduce the capital gains taxes that apply to investments. The general treatment of investment capital has improved enormously in a manner that has increased employment and the ability of ordinary people to invest in something other than the family home to their profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I draw the Minister of State's attention to the provisions dealing with anti-social behaviour in sections 15 and 76. This is a timely and welcome development. I hope these are not vague provisions and that they will operate efficiently and effectively. Anti-social behaviour is a major issue of concern in my Tallaght constituency. Because of the varying price of houses, there are whole swathes of my constituency which, while they are private houses, have become rented dwellings. In some of these areas there has been the unwelcome development of unregistered and unscrupulous landlords and tenants behaving in an anti-social manner, making life hell for the long-stay residents who have purchased their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Prior to this legislation, anti-social behaviour was addressed by the local authority where a person in a housing estate behaved in an anti-social and intimidating fashion towards a neighbour and disrupted the whole neighbourhood. It could not be tackled in a meaningful way, however, if it involved those living in private rented dwellings, and the Bill tackles that problem for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The provisions on anti-social behaviour are very welcome. They will help stabilise many areas in my constituency and elsewhere where there is a preponderance of rented dwellings. Tenants will now have rights they did not enjoy before and landlords will have obligations with regard to maintenance of the property. Sections 15 and 76 are very important provisions. They provide that a third party or a neighbour may tackle the phenomenon known as the neighbours from hell syndrome, where a person decides to behave in a harassing manner towards a neighbour, where there is persistent and annoying behaviour by one person against a neighbour or against a series of neighbours on a street. The third party can take an action to the tenancies board to enforce the terms and conditions of the rental contract. The obligation is on the landlord to vindicate those rights and ensure that the person behaving in an anti-social manner will be swiftly dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The case law which will build up as a result of the Bill will tease out the detail. If a difficulty or ambiguity arises with regard to these specific provisions I hope the Minister will give a commitment to act swiftly to amend and enhance the sections. I do not need to preach to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, about the importance of these provisions. He is a man who has been rooted in his constituency in his time as a backbencher and a Minister of State and is aware of the needs of the individuals he serves in public life. He knows more about daily life and how it plays out in urban and suburban estates in this city. He will be mindful of this and it should not be necessary to include stronger deterrents in this section of the Bill to prevent the thuggery, intimidation and harassment that can ruin a neighbourhood for decent people. Neighbours from hell can cause awful problems. There is an area in my constituency, and Deputy O'Connor would know about it because he represented it as a county councillor, where such behaviour became a terrible problem due to the preponderance of rented accommodation and difficult, nasty individuals. It led to many home owners moving out of the area to escape the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">In recent years we have struggled to achieve two basic objectives – to reduce house prices and ensure the funding of a mortgage is not so onerous as to create the threat of negative equity. Many experts from the Opposition and elsewhere have tried to preach to the Government about the housing crisis and the gap between supply and demand. Being brutally honest, the Government had to be careful not to create over-supply in the market with the consequent potential for negative equity such as I witnessed when living in London in the 1980s. People there were living miserable lives with huge chunks of their income going to mortgages while house values had collapsed. That is a major risk because it squeezes disposable income, reduces consumer demand and kills the economy by attacking consumers' ability to spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The other reason housing supply is still in deficit is simple. Fianna Fáil is sometimes a very far sighted party—</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_783">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the long overdue Residential Tenancies Bill 2003. The Bill proposes to implement elements of the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector published in July 2000. It is indicative of the lack of commitment on the part of the Government that we are still on Second Stage of this much needed Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The Bill is welcome but it is modest in its scope and fails to deal with the issues of registration and declarations to the Revenue Commissioners. With the objective of improving the Bill, the Labour Party will submit a range of amendments and I hope the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be as open in his approach as he normally is. The rights of private sector tenants have been completely disregarded over the years and it is imperative that the views of all sides of the House are taken into account so that we enact the best possible legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Why has this important legislation not been a priority over the years? It is obvious that the landlord lobby has more influence on the establishment, particularly on Fianna Fáil, than the tenants. Tenants tend not to vote in large numbers – many do not even register – and, therefore, they are perceived as powerless. It is unfortunate that the people's needs are not given priority over pressure groups when legislation is being drawn up.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">In the private rented sector there are, in footballing terms, two divisions. At premier league level, in the expensive rented accommodation, leases are part of life and provide security of tenure for their duration. In the lower division are the thousands of tenants who have been deprived of the security of a lease. Such security is very relevant and it means a great deal to an individual or a family. A lease which provides individual tenants and their families with security of tenure means so much to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">As one who has never lived in private rented accommodation, it was not until I discussed problems with my constituents in my clinics – this highlights the importance of clinic work – that I came to realise what can and, in numerous cases, does happen when lease arrangements are not in place. Unscrupulous landlords can use this to get rid of tenants more or less at will. Thousands of landlords do an excellent job and provide a great service but, unfortunately, there are unscrupulous landlords who have used the system to get rid of tenants more or less at will. The knock-on effect is that tenants realise at an early stage that they are not in a position to negotiate, resist inappropriate rent increases or demand the implementation of existing legal requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">A tenant has a legal right to a rent book and to have the structure of a premises maintained by a landlord. As politicians, most of us would be aware of cases where tenants who fought for their rights were dealt with effectively by landlords. A notice to quit would arrive for anyone who was prepared to take them on. While it is true that a notice to quit does not in itself compel a tenant to vacate a premises, the reality is that many vulnerable people, most of whom have no experience of legal matters, would take the option to move out or crawl back to the landlord on his terms. Unfortunately, that has been the reality of life for tenants in Dublin and other areas throughout the country. The message is quickly put out that few tenants succeed in the courts, given the lack of rights-based legislation for tenants. In as much as the Bill provides for this, I welcome that element of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">A month ago I was contacted by a constituent of mine. His family, with a modest income, consisted of his wife and two children. They were renting a rundown premises which in all probability had no planning permission and they were looking for a local authority house. As they had been in the house for a number of years, I asked them where they were on the housing list. To my astonishment I was informed that they were not on the list as they had never applied. When I asked them why they had not, it transpired that the landlord, when granting them the tenancy, stated emphatically that if an official of the council or an inspector from a local authority ever turned up to inspect the dwelling, he would ensure that the family were out on their heels overnight. His tenants never applied to the local authorities from that address because they were afraid. They had nowhere to go. As the family were in dire straits at the time, they accepted the tenancy. Thankfully, that family is now housed by the local authority. This is a further example of the type of bullying by unscrupulous landlords that has taken place over the years. The Bill is the first step in regularising the sector and it is to be welcomed in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">I have outlined the need for security of tenure and it is one of the main features of the Bill. Tenants will have security of tenure for four years. The landlord may end a tenancy by giving four weeks' notice. All tenancies will end after four years. The tenants may continue to occupy the premises, although I may be wrong in that from what the Minister said earlier, but they will be considered to have a new tenancy. I have a problem with this in so far as landlords will be able to end the tenancy during the first six months without giving a reason. This is unfair. The issue should be revisited and perhaps we should avail of the detailed debate on Committee Stage to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">One of the major issues concerning the private market is rent. It is a problem for everybody. Excessive and non-negotiable rent increases have been the bane of many tenants over the years. The same dictatorial approach by many although not necessarily the majority of landlords has resulted in ordinary tenants being evicted and made homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Under the Bill, rents shall not be set either at the beginning of the tenancy or at subsequent revisions at a rate higher than the market rate. I have some difficulty with the concept of the market rate because it is vague and can vary between streets. The requirement to pay the market rent creates hardships for some categories of tenants, especially those on low incomes. For the majority of such people, the possibility of a local authority dwelling is but a dream in the short-term given the performance of the Government and its predecessor over the past six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">While the Minister may say that more money has been provided, the fact remains that, in the six years the Government and its predecessor have been in office, the numbers on the housing lists have increased from 27,000 to nearly 50,000, an increase of almost 100%. If we equate that to the number of individuals involved, between 150,000 and 200,000 individuals could be looking to the State to provide housing.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>

          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_795">The fairness of the system in terms of the market price will depend to a great extent on the Private Residential Tenancies Board which will adjudicate on such disputes. Accordingly, it is vital that we have a broadly-based board consisting of people with the necessary knowledge and expertise. In the past, Ministers, and even some Ministers from my party, tended to take the opportunity to fill boards on the basis of political patronage. The composition of this board is too important for such a practice and, in any event, the public is disillusioned with that that type of cronyism. I think the Minister gets my message.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">It is estimated that as few as 20% of private rented tenancies are registered in accordance with legal requirements and regulations. Since 1996, all such properties are required to be registered with the local authorities. It is estimated that there are 150,000 tenancies in the country of which 120,000 are still unregistered. It is obvious to me and to any fair-minded person that the majority of landlords have decided to give the two fingers to the statutory requirements of this State. Over the years, county managers failed to pursue these people while at the same time they had no difficulties in vigorously pursuing outstanding charges, through the courts if necessary, against ordinary PAYE workers. Is that a case of double standards? County managers do not need to be concerned about changing their policies or their ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">This legislation has not changed anything. The Government has not got the message from what has happened over the past ten years. It has learned nothing from public scandals, such as the Ansbacher and overseas accounts scandals and the tribunals, all of which have shown how far some people will go to avoid paying their legitimate taxes. It is an utter disgrace that provision has not been made for the transfer of registration information to the Revenue Commissioners. What message does that send to people? Non-compliant landlords know that the Government is prepared to accept the non-payment of taxation. Compare that with the approach taken by the Government to membership of credit unions and to people paying their way. There are concerns about what might happen if a gun was put to these people's heads. However, in the context of equality, that issue must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Since the Book of Estimates was published on 17 November, things have changed, particularly in terms of the rent supplement. The State has acknowledged that private rented accommodation helps to meet the housing needs of people. I referred earlier to the shortage of local authority housing and to the number of people on the housing lists and in receipt of rent subsidy. The rent subsidy has been abused. I have spoken to community welfare officers in my constituency who cannot quantify the abuse, but they know it is happening. However, what the Minister for Social and Family Affairs did was a disgrace and it will have a detrimental effect on the housing requirements of our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">I received a document recently which was signed by people who deal on a daily basis with those in need. It was signed by the director of Threshold, the director of the Simon Community, the vice-president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the chief executive of Focus Ireland, the director of One Parent Exchange &amp; Network, the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, the chief executive of the Irish Refugee Council, the director of the National Youth Council of Ireland, the general council of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the chief executive of Age Action Ireland Limited, the chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance and the director of Cherish. They clearly outlined the impact of the changes to the rent supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The Government must deal with this issue. If people are being refused rent supplement, there is no point in the Minister for Social and Family Affairs saying that no one will lose out. The money will not be provided to the community welfare officers because there is a cutback of €50 million. What will happen when they do not get rent subsidy? Will they be made homeless? The Minister stated that they should go back to their local authority, but they cannot get a local authority house. Will they get priority over everyone else on the housing list? This is a major problem which must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Yesterday we saw the first criminal conviction of a public figure for corruption in the planning process. As a former member of Dublin County Council and a member of Fingal County Council since 1994, I have more than 20 years experience and I am keenly aware of the relationship between politicians and developers. The details from the Flood and Mahon tribunals have been revealing. The downside is that all politicians have been branded as corrupt. It is believed that we are all in receipt of brown envelopes for legitimate election expenses. However, nothing could be further from the truth as far as I and members of the Labour Party are concerned. I welcome yesterday's decision and I hope more charges will be brought.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I do not accept that the planning process has been cleared of the undue influence of builders and developers in terms of rezonings. The planning process in County Dublin, for example, has been smeared. County development plans are now being drawn up throughout the country. Everything must be done in a transparent way and the draft plan which goes on display must be based on the views of the managers and the planners. However, they are also required to consider the representations they receive.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">I want to bring to the Minister's attention my concern about a current variation in a local authority. Given that a final decision has not yet been taken, I do not propose to say any more at this stage. However, I want to put on the record that I may contact the Minister in the future, depending on the decision taken by the local authority in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">I welcome the Bill. There is a lot to be done on Committee Stage, but I hope we will get a Bill with which most of us will be happy.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister for taking action in this area. When considering the Bill, we must reflect on the history of housing in this country and the roles of local authorities and private landlords. There is no doubt that the roles of both have changed dramatically in recent years. There is a large number of people on the housing list. There is a culture in this country of owning one's home. We have a higher percentage of home owners than other countries in Europe and that is driving the next generation to find and rent their own accommodation or to apply for local authority housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Many changes have taken place, including the provision of money by the Government and the introduction of different schemes, such as the shared ownership scheme and other schemes operated by local authorities. Interest rates have reached a new low and mortgages are more readily available. However, what did not happen were the changes which were necessary in the private housing market. The law favours landlords. There is no need for them to refurbish and maintain their properties and to provide a good standard of accommodation to tenants. That is generally the case throughout the country, although there are exceptions. Some landlords will put as many people as they can into one house and try to extract as much money as they can from them. This needs to change along the lines of European standards under which proper rented houses are available – town houses, flats, bedsits and so on – which provide a reasonable standard of living. A changeover is taking place in terms of what is available. This legislation will bring about change, but there is also a change in attitude among landlords towards their tenants. We need to speed up that process to come into line with European attitudes and make sure tenants get a better deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The housing problem has been referred to by many speakers. As long as I have been a member of my local authority – 25 years – there has been a housing problem. It is extremely difficult for a local authority to keep up with the number of houses required at any time. In Kilkenny almost 1,000 people are on the housing list and the number continues to grow as the local authority continues to provide houses, which means it never catches up. That said, it is making an effort to fulfil the need and deal with certain numbers from the list every year. The increase in the price of land and the construction of houses has not helped. We need to address this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">Perhaps we need to understand the profile of those on the housing list long-term to provide a better, more focused housing programme. In some local authorities, for example in Kilkenny, there is duplication because there is a county council and a borough council. We must define the profile of the applicant and either construct the houses required through the local authority or buy turnkey developments from private developers. If we do not go down that road, we will never be able to deal with the long-term applicants on the list.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Local authorities are making good use of voluntary housing schemes but this could be exploited a lot more. We need to put many more houses on the market at that level. In my area, the notion that one cannot buy a Respond house – Respond is a voluntary housing organisation – should be investigated because people have a desire to own their own houses. It is important within society that this is achieved and we must acknowledge that. We must also acknowledge that we need to put in much more effort through the local authority in the provision of these houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The Bill deals with the responsibility of the landlord in terms of repairs, upkeep, the policing of anti-social behaviour and so on. The same can apply to local authorities. There is a need to employ people within the housing sections of local authorities who will engage directly with the local authorities we represent. They will take the problems we encounter in some housing estates, such as anti-social behaviour and drug and alcohol use, and deal with them in a truly professional way, not just identifying them but also solving them, perhaps by introducing the health board or other agencies to ensure a workable solution is found. As the Government, we are the landlords when it comes to local authorities and we should take full responsibility for what happens in the State in partnership with the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">This partnership must be strengthened by the presence of certain officials who will drive the policy and ensure that a solution is found to the various problems in certain estates. Solutions can be found. Problems need not be so ongoing and ingrained in these communities that they cannot be dealt with. For the betterment of these estates and the quality of life of the population within them we need to deal with these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">The same applies to the older estates and the need to upgrade them and continue a proper repair programme. We need to put more money into the system and ensure that the older estates are brought up to the standard we expect in this day and age and ensure that the houses now surrounded by newer, modern houses – every urban centre has developments situated around older schemes of houses – also enjoy an improvement. The rising tide should lift all boats. It is only through a focused policy that we will deal with the issues that are beginning to emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">For those left waiting on the housing lists and who find themselves needing the protection of a Bill of this kind, it will not happen overnight. Local authorities will be asked to police these measures or at least respect the various sections to ensure that the rights of the tenant are acknowledged. For those providing houses in the private sector, this is a two-way street. There are rights on the side of the tenant and responsibilities for the landlord. However, there is also responsibility for the tenant. The law can be acknowledged by the landlord as he fulfils the various sections of the Bill, but the tenant has a responsibility to behave properly and ensure the property is at least kept in shape. Tenants should not do anything to reduce the value of the property through their behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">To achieve this in a similar way to the partnership between the local authority and the community, there is a need for co-operation and partnership between landlord and tenant. We can introduce as much legislation as we like in the House but, if the basic business relationship between landlord and tenant is not friendly, the local authority will be in trouble and there will be accommodation that is poorly maintained. I welcome the Bill because it establishes the rights of which I speak for both parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">One of the issues emerging because of the numbers on the housing lists and the profile of applicants is that of elderly men and women who have been on the housing list for a number of years and are living in private rented accommodation. They quietly go about their lives and pay their rent but have come to an age at which they are finished their work and it has dawned on them that they are living in poor accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">We must make a greater effort through the local authorities to reach out to these people and provide proper accommodation for them. They should be housed in a complex or in group housing with others of their own age. At present, the elderly men and women scattered throughout many urban centres are outnumbered by young people who are a source of anti-social behaviour and therefore a nuisance to the elderly who once enjoyed the accommodation in which they lived.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">We need to absorb these people into the system of local authority housing, where they can enjoy their later years in greater security and comfort. This Bill offers them some form of protection – four years' tenancy and the right of complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board. This is covered in sections 7 and 56. I would like to see this working in conjunction with those who are employed within the local authority so that it is done in a sensitive way, on the understanding that the best end for such people is that they are given local authority accommodation. In the interim, they are at least given the protection and security offered in the Bill and the individuals do not have to confront those causing nuisance or vandalism within the house.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">There can be a poor mix in a house, often when it is occupied by a large number of people. Some of those people are on housing lists and have almost become prisoners within their own homes because they are not pushing their case and the list is growing. The majority of people on the list are young and agitate constantly to get their houses while the others fall behind. I make a special appeal on their behalf that we do something positive for them while at the same time ensuring that if they complain, or complaints are made on their behalf under this legislation, they will not be subjected to further nuisance or vandalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The protection of the rental structure and its management also arises under this legislation. A number of long-running issues have been raised at various times, and this Bill confronts those issues head-on. It gives both tenants and landlords a way of dealing with problems. I understand the rent is to be linked to the commercial rate that is achieved at the time. This will form a guideline for both the landlord and tenant. Rents have increased so substantially in many urban centres that they bear no resemblance to the original rent when the tenant first moved into the home. In some cases, the landlord has either bullied or forced the tenant to acquiesce and the rent has been quickly increased to a point where it better reflects rent one would expect to pay for more modern accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">In a way, the rent allowances that were introduced skewed the market. When the allowance was introduced it cost approximately €5 million per annum and it now runs to several times that. While changes have been made, everyone should recognise that a huge amount of money has been committed to the scheme. The effect of the scheme, particularly in the earlier years, has seen rent increase above reasonable levels. Because of the demand created at the height of economic growth in 2000, rent was knocked out of place and continues at this level even thought it does not reflect the standard of the accommodation. We are getting poor value for money from the rent subsidy.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The scheme should be reviewed in the context of the local authority house building programme. If we were to accelerate that programme, we might find that people become less reliant on the rental subsidy. The sooner we can move towards this and provide people with their own homes, rather than giving them money to pay inflated rents, the better it will be for those on housing lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">When talking about the upkeep of accommodation, I reflect on the involvement in this issue by members of the clergy in my constituency, who highlighted it almost 20 years ago. They pointed out that some landlords did not pay attention to the conditions of the accommodation they were providing. They completely ignored the efforts of the local authorities to bring these properties up to date and were willing to allow people to live in squalor. While this has improved over the years, it has not improved enough. I am glad the Minister is dealing with this issue in the Bill and ensuring that property is kept to a reasonable standard. In turn, the tenant will acknowledge this effort and ensure that the property is kept in respectable repair. This is an important element of the Bill as this can sometimes be a source of disagreement between landlord and tenant. As I understand it, this can be the subject of a complaint to the private residential tenancies board.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">A fine of €20,000 is mentioned in the Bill. This will serve to focus the attention of the landlord on what might happen if they eject someone from a property. This will make for a better landlord-tenant relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">I hope that some of the finer details of the Bill can be settled on Committee Stage. This is good legislation and should be welcomed by all involved in politics. After all, we deal with this issue at the coalface and know the problems we are facing. This Bill is reasonable and is a move in the right direction. When it is enacted, I hope the local authority makes it workable.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_825">My constituency has a high level of rented accommodation. I alluded to this some time ago and I think the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was paying me a compliment when he accused me of having constituency envy. While many of the people in my constituency may live in rented accommodation, they are still fine, decent and upstanding people drawn from many races and religions. I hope the Minister was paying me a compliment, otherwise he was insulting those people. I would prefer if the Minister were around for that debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">It was insulting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_392">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_827">The Deputy is correct. In many cases, the constituents of leafy Dublin Mid-West have no choice but to live in rented accommodation. While some parts of the constituency, at least those areas where the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, dares to canvass, may be called leafy, some of the other areas are among the most deprived parts of Ireland. When people cannot find a home or have no security of tenure, it diminishes the sense of community. The breakdown of community leads to other problems and, inevitably, anti-social behaviour and crime. Net Garda strength has increased by only 31 since the Government came to power. The stoppage of overtime payments has affected some operations and the use of public order vehicles. If one looks at the cycle, one can see that lack of proper legislation contributes to social breakdown and crime. As long as one is well off and does not live in such areas, one does not have to suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I point this out because the idea of owning a home is a dream that may never be realised by many of my constituents. They may never get a home from a local authority as local authorities are not given enough funding, or are encouraged to sell land to developers rather than build.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The Bill seems to be a genuine attempt to address the problems facing tenants and landlords under current legislation. Sections 12 to 14 make a reasonable attempt to ensure that landlords meet their obligations and that tenants are not penalised for seeking their rights. I have some concerns regarding the provision preventing a rent review more than once every 12 months. That period could be extended but even the 12 month limit is welcome, as is the right to review rents where no right is currently provided. Even as it stands the Bill will improve the position of tenants by promoting greater regularisation and professionalism within the housing sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The Bill has many weaknesses and enforcement will present problems. Even local authorities have problems enforcing the law so the new board will also have problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The private rented sector is currently increasing following a decline until the mid-1990s. One in every eight households now lives in private rented accommodation. I hope what I say about these households will have an impact on the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and on the Tánaiste, if she reads the Official Report. These households include the most impoverished and marginalised members of society. As my colleague and party leader, Deputy Sargent, has already pointed out, at least one third of tenants in private accommodation are in receipt of social welfare rent supplement, which reduces the choice of rented accommodation for many people unlucky enough to be in this position. Many adults and children live in appalling conditions. In my constituency there is some fairly good quality rented accommodation in the suburbs of Lucan and Clondalkin although there are cases of large families being packed into houses. In other places, particularly in inner city areas, tenants live in appalling conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Some people live in neglected forgotten areas which many politicians would not even visit to canvass but where gardaí are charged with trying to maintain order in the face of huge underresourcing. The decent citizens, who are the majority in these areas, live in a constant state of fear of the increased incidence of thuggery and criminal activity. I do not wish to mention Limerick, because this behaviour is found everywhere. When social conditions break down crime increases, criminals mobilise, drug pushers move in and take over and the people who have been living in the area for a long time have to suffer. Gardaí, to their credit, do the best they can with the resources they are given. I make no apology for pointing out this under-resourcing during this debate. Gardaí will be under even more pressure unless we ensure a proper social mix with the proper planning and facilities provided. People who do not come from salubrious areas such as Dublin South-East live in difficult conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Deputy Boyle has already spoken about the poor quality of the housing provided, even in the areas designated for urban renewal schemes. Deputy Sargent mentioned insulation and energy efficiency. Not many Deputies read up on energy matters but I have been doing so. Some experts suggest that oil production is likely to peak between 2006 and 2013. What the Greens have been predicting about global warming, possible climate change effects on sea levels and how we will cope with increased flooding, is already happening. Of even greater significance is the fact that when oil production peaks and it costs more to extract the remaining oil from the ground we will see a major increase in the price of oil. Much rented accommodation uses oil or gas for fuel. Our gas reserves are also quite small and gas prices will rise along with oil prices. The issue of renewable energy must be addressed. A measure could be added to this Bill to ensure that private rented accommodation is properly insulated and as energy efficient as possible. Rented accommodation should have even higher standards of energy efficiency than owner occupiers currently enjoy. That is a matter for a number of Departments but an energy efficiency measure could be added to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I note the media attention given to Punchestown and the criticism of the Minister for Finance. The PD tail wagging the Fianna Fáil dog is coming home to roost again. This is the sort of dog that eats greedily from the hands of developers, nuzzles up to those well-off enough to pay for dietary supplements if they are coeliacs and are insulated from the cutbacks but cocks it leg to the rest of society. That is why I referred in the Estimates debate yesterday to people feeling they are being spat upon and urinated upon. Unless politicians are seen to take proper action in the provision of housing as well as in cutbacks we will be seen as elitist and separate. I do not know of even one Deputy who lives in rented accommodation, unless in a second house close to the Dáil in Dublin. Mr. Pádraig Flynn sent out the wrong message about politicians on "The Late Late Show" a few years ago when he said it was difficult to keep three houses. That sort of patronising arrogance is perceived to be typical of politicians. It behoves us to change those perceptions and to be seen to take action, even if it means clamping down on landlords who would exploit tenants. Many landlords are business people who wish to make an honest living but there must be legislation and rules to control this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">It seems that in some areas of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and other parts of the country, horses have better accommodation than people living on rent allowance. This is not good enough. I hope the amendments proposed by organisations such as Threshold and tabled by Deputies are seriously considered by the Government so that the Bill, which is a genuine attempt to address some of the problems facing tenants and landlords, can be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Tenants in private rented accommodation are currently exposed to rent increases almost at will. While there is some protection for longer term tenants, periodic or probationary tenants are liable to be evicted with only 28 days notice and no valid reason. For the 100,000 people who are in receipt of rent allowance and others who are in receipt of family income supplement or on low wages, day-to-day life is fraught with insecurity and worry. Their situation is not improved by this Bill. Unscrupulous landlords can and do take advantage of those not in a position to argue for their rights. This can be because of a lack of options, because they feel intimidated or because lack of education means they do not know their rights. In many cases they receive no assistance with these difficulties. A notice period of more than 28 days is required and the time required to qualify for decent notice needs to be reduced. One might call me naive but I believe two months would be ideal in both these cases. A qualification period of three months would, nevertheless, be acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Some flaws stand out in the Bill like members of the Progressive Democrats on a community employment scheme or, given that there are no members of the Progressive Democrats in the Chamber, members of the Cabinet who subscribe to the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility. The flaws have the effect of watering down the Bill and making it a little ambiguous – maybe this was the intention. This legislation should be as rights based as the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Section 4 contains a glaring omission in terms of bedsits. The wording should include "units where bathrooms may be shared by occupants of different tenancies within the same building". Otherwise, those who live in bedsits will not have recourse to the new board.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The board is supposed to be the bee's knees when resolving disputes. My colleagues and I do not necessarily agree that the establishment of the board is the best option. The allocation of more power locally, where possible, in addition to proper funding, might make the current system work. It has not worked in terms of enforcement because the resources have not been in place. However, this is beyond the scope of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Section 6 refers to the servicing of notices by post. Many have alluded to this during the debate and therefore I will not discuss it in detail, but I hope an amendment will be made in this regard. However, the best method – this cannot be included in the Bill – would be for the landlord to issue the notice in person – if landlords are looking for money they visit the individual in person as quickly as they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Section 9 lists the penalties for committing offences under the proposed Bill. A daily fine of €250 is touted for each offence. This is small in relative terms and should be increased in line with other fines. Threshold, in its submission, called for a fine of €500, which is the <i>per diem</i> fine in the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003. I have no reason to disagree with Threshold in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I praised parts of sections 12 to 14 because they spell out the obligations of landlords and tenants much more clearly than was hitherto the case. However, there is still ambiguity. Threshold stated in its submission that section 12(1) provides that the obligations under this section are "in addition to the obligations arising by or under any enactment". Furthermore, it stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_843">However the inference that section 18 of the 1992 Act and the 1993 standards regulations are part of a landlord's obligations will not be recognised by all those concerned. Compliance with minimum legal dwelling standards at the low priced end of the rental market has been problematic, and an express obligation in the Bill should help to improve matters. An amendment should make explicit the landlord's obligation to ensure that the rental property complies with the minimum standards legislation as currently enacted or as amended from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Threshold's request seems reasonable and I hope the Minister will see fit to heed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Section 12 also requires tightening up to ensure that deposits are promptly returned because, in some cases, the money involved is crucial to the families concerned, particularly if they are seeking a new home. Furthermore, under this section, the reasons for which landlords could reimburse tenants for repairs could be specified. Again, there may be a reason for the ambiguity that exists in this instance. Threshold lists various reasons for reimbursement, including a burst water pipe, a blocked toilet and an inoperative cooker. Other reasons could include an inoperative washing machine. These reasons could be specified and provision could be made for others, yet to be decided. This would copperfasten the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Section 14 has some good provisions to discourage landlords from retaliating against, threatening or intimidating tenants who seek to assert their rights. We know that tenants will be able to inform the board about non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill, but a far better deterrent would be to make certain actions an offence, particularly if the enforcement issue is catered for.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">On the provisions under section 16 to address anti-social behaviour, I and my party do not want to be regarded as anti-landlord – we agree with landlords on this – but we are in favour of proper legislation. These provisions discourage landlords from retaliating against, threatening or intimidating tenants, who in many cases may just want to point out their rights. Tenants can approach the board to draw attention to non-compliance with the Bill. However, we must examine what constitutes anti-social behaviour. Section 16 needs to be transparent to rule out unjust accusations.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Section 19 does not clarify who has to prove a rent is above the prevailing market rate. Tenants who may not have had proper educational opportunities may have fewer means at their disposal to obtain the necessary information needed to make a case to their landlord. The board will not provide clarity in terms of how one proves rents are excessive or who does so. We need to examine this. Threshold, with which I do not necessarily agree, suggested that further details be provided, and I agree with it in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">There is a need for enforcement because local authorities have consistently failed to register landlords. What chance will the new board have without the adequate resources? Will the resources be provided? Who is more likely to go to jail for non-compliance? Will it be the landlord, for evicting a family wrongfully or the family who, for genuine financial reasons, defaults on a payment? These issues need to be raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Time does not permit me to discuss Part 4. I wanted to get a few issues off my chest regarding the impact of bad housing policy on society and communities, and I hope the points my colleagues and I have made will be taken on board. I draw the Minister's attention to the submission by Threshold, which also made some valid points.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_393">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_851">I welcome the Residential Tenancies Bill, which will comprehensively reform the private rented sector, and I commend the Minister for his work in this area. There is agreement on all sides of the House that tenants will benefit in terms of security of tenure and the provisions for rent reviews. I welcome the mechanism for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">One of the great weaknesses of the existing system is that it is virtually impossible to resolve disputes outside the courts. The courts are regarded as a very unattractive option by many, not least because of the costs involved and the very long delays that arise in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">It is fair to say there has been a long-standing negative view in Ireland of residing in rented accommodation. This view has arisen against the backdrop of a very strong tradition of home ownership and the aspiration of many to own their own homes – generally, they achieve this goal. There has also been a deep-seated anti-landlord bias in the Irish psyche because of the folk memory of evictions etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">In some respects, this has probably inhibited our ability to address real problems in the private residential sector, which we have been reluctant to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Presenting the Bill last June, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, described it as the most far-reaching legislation in perhaps a century and a half, which is true. It is also the case that some less important legislation has managed to achieve its aims, which is not always the case with legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The private rented sector plays a key role in overall housing provision and, in many respects, is becoming more important. When the programme for Government, Sustaining Progress, which contains a commitment to reform the sector, was drawn up, considerable work was under way on this issue. A number of bodies, notably the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, have contributed to the debate on this sector. The commission's recommendations have largely been adopted in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">I recall thinking when it was established that a body with 18 members would find it difficult working effectively and efficiently. I now acknowledge that its broadly-based membership was an advantage. I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to reach agreement on some, if not most, of the conclusions of the commission's report because some of its members were drawn from very different perspectives and were not the kind of people one would have confidently expected to reach agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">Everybody will acknowledge that it would have been impossible for the commission to accommodate all the competing demands, but it did a good job. Some of its members have complained that the Minister of State has not implemented all their report's recommendations. He has gone a long way towards doing so and has addressed the general thrust of the commission's proposals in a fair manner. This is a reasonable and workable balance, the upshot of which will be a much improved private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">As the Minister of State said, it will be necessary to support some of the legislative provisions through fiscal measures. This has happened to an extent already, notably in the Finance Bills of 2001 and 2002, which provided tax incentives in allowing mortgage interest and refurbishment costs to be offset against rental income. While these provisions have clearly contributed to increasing supply, the Minister of State will need to consider further measures in light of continued significant demand for rented accommodation, which arises as a result of a number of factors, not least mobility.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">I noted that the Minister of State referred to his interest in the use of public private partnerships in this area. I hope that whatever he has in mind will not fall foul of the Stability and Growth Pact, EUROSTAT or various other constraints. We have all come across worthy projects which would have proceeded had it not been for the snares in these pacts and EUROSTAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Further refinement of Part V of the Planning and Development Act is necessary. This provision is an excellent concept that has been difficult to implement. Its considerable potential should be examined. There is also significant capacity in the voluntary sector, particularly at community level, to adopt the social housing model. To date this model has been primarily advanced by organisations at national or regional level, which have done a wonderful job and built up high levels of expertise and experience in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Voluntary organisations in small local communities in rural areas have also provided social housing. In Lissycasey in County Clare, for example, the local community acquired a site, effectively parish property, and successfully built a small number of social housing units. Obviously in such a confined area, the management team will be small and such communities will lose the scale advantages available to national bodies, but they bring properties to the market by constructing and making available houses which have a throughput of people. They also create pride in the fact that the local community was the entity which adopted the social housing model and provided accommodation of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">There is a massive level of goodwill and support for the kind of model described by Deputy McGuinness to provide housing for older people in their own communities. This area should receive much greater attention from the Minister of State and the Department and much greater encouragement from the housing sections of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Demand for accommodation is substantial in a number of categories of people who frequently encounter significant difficulty in finding acceptable housing due to financial considerations. One such group is young separated people, generally men since the female partner and children usually remain in the family home. This is one of the areas in which the number in need is growing and to which policy should be directed. The private rented sector can play and has played an important role in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">There is also a subgroup across all communities of people who are barely capable of independent living or need, at least, to be living relatively close to family or with access to a mixture of family and community support. For a variety of reasons, such people are often most successful when they live outside the family home. Clearly, this is one of the areas in which social housing could play a role but, with the right incentives, the private rented sector would also be prepared to play an important role.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Irrespective of the kind of legislation, policies or resources applied to this issue, there will always be difficulties caused by mobility. For example, cities and towns with universities or other third level colleges have major short-term demands for accommodation, which tend to be accompanied by shortages. Likewise, they experience an oversupply at certain times of the year. It is difficult to devise a policy to successfully address such circumstances, particularly one based on a public sector approach. To be fair, the issue is being managed fairly well by the private residential sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Many issues affect supply, including planning. While this is particularly true in rural areas, it is also increasingly the case in towns and built up areas. We have a considerable amount of work to do in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">It is also fair to acknowledge that the building industry has provided a record level of housing in recent years. In 2002, for example, 58,000 units were completed compared to 34,000 units in 1996. This enormous growth is being repeated year on year. With output levels of around 50,000 units in the past three years, the sector's performance has been impressive. At the current rate of provision, the aim of constructing 600,000 units in ten years now appears attainable. Considerable improvements have been made since 1997 and a number of serious constraints have been removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Ultimately, additional supply is one of the most important factors in securing lower rents. There has also been a general improvement in the quality of rented accommodation. Once this Bill has been enacted, it will be much easier to address the problem of quality. In the past, at least a minority of tenants lived in poor conditions, which their landlords were simply not prepared to address. Perhaps this was due to a lack of incentives or the absence of an agency charged with ensuring they took action.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">A number of speakers referred to the effects of anti-social behaviour. Local authorities had enormous difficulty addressing this problem. The private rented sector was having similar difficulties. A Threshold report, if I remember correctly, acknowledged that the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 was successful in helping local authorities to address anti-social behaviour, although obviously the manner in which it was applied did not meet with the full approval of Threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The public sector housing programme impacts enormously on how the private rented sector operates. There has been massive investment in the Traveller accommodation programme. It is hugely expensive and we have been trying to learn from the mistakes of the past. However, it also helps to address housing issues in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">There is an urgent need to put a system in place to ensure that public housing is quickly repaired, reallocated and reoccupied. Sometimes considerable cost is involved in refurbishing a house after tenants have left it but, most frequently, the damage occurs in the period after one tenant has left and before the house is reallocated. Local authorities claim, with some justification, that they do not have sufficient resources to make the house habitable immediately for somebody else to move in. However, they are losing on the double. They are losing rent while the house is unoccupied and, in most cases, the price of the glass in the windows which is invariably smashed. There is also the price of making the place secure and, in terms of impact on the neighbourhood, they are losing badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Part 8 provides for the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. It has an enormous range of functions. It sets out the minimum obligations for tenants and landlords, tracks rent setting and reviews and deals with many other areas. The Bill excludes holiday accommodation, employment-related and business lettings and social housing. In light of what I said earlier, this is probably reasonable but it could be expanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">The Irish Property Owners Association was a party to the commission. It has written to complain about a small number of provisions in the Bill. It is concerned about the four year right to occupy following an initial six month tenancy. On the other hand, tenant groups, such as Threshold and others, have the opposite view. The Minister seems to have struck a reasonable balance between the two. However, the board will need to keep this under close review. The Irish Property Owners Association is not keen on compulsory registration, especially with regard to the frequency with which it might be required and the fees that will be charged. Given the history of the sector, however, this provision in the Bill must be given a chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The association's third complaint relates to a package of measures, including taxation measures, to make the sector more attractive. This can be reviewed frequently; indeed, it should be reviewed annually. As was proven with the implementation of the Bacon proposals and the rescinding of some of them, this is something that impacts more quickly than most people would expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Members have received correspondence about how the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has addressed problems with the rent supplement and the six months requirement for the supplement. Many of the people who have written to me agree that the existing system is both flawed and expensive. They also agree that the rent supplement was not designed to be a social housing programme. They go on to express fears about the effect of the changes made by the Minister. This issue would be better addressed within housing policy provisions rather than social welfare provisions. I suspect that the fears of the people who have written to Members are considerably exaggerated but its impact in the housing area is best addressed in the context of housing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">We have also received letters from constituents and others who think they are constituents about the right to housing. They refer to waiting lists of 48,000 households. I understand that several of these people are registered with as many as five local authorities and that this figure is grossly exaggerated. It is not updated frequently enough. They claim there is a need for 7,000 social housing units per annum. That is a daunting target and it is difficult to see it being provided exclusively from the public purse. The Minister's idea about enticing the private sector into this area has a great deal of merit. These people are also, quite reasonably, looking for transitional and short-term housing rather than long-term bed and breakfast accommodation for families. That will be difficult to achieve. However, a stock is needed to deal with the serious problems that arise in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Threshold has been actively campaigning on behalf of social housing and housing requirements. During a budget debate some years ago I said that the CORI report tends to be the bible of Opposition Members. I have been here long enough to have been on the Opposition and the Government benches. The report is adopted with some vigour by all Members when they are in Opposition but tends to be quickly dismissed when they are in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I would not blame Threshold if that organisation thought the same applied to it. It has produced some interesting and good reports. Its submission to the housing commission was fair and solid. The report by Tony McCashin of TCD is an important work. I do not agree with everything in it but it contains much useful information. The proposal for a national rent indexing system would be difficult to accomplish and I presume the commission concluded that the market was a better leveller. However, the report is good.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The organisation's profile of landlords in Dublin city, which was carried out a couple of years ago, is also interesting. It found, for example, that 61% of landlords have only one property. It also found, presumably on the basis of the figures, that speculative investors have been the key factor in increasing house prices and that 70% of them entered the private rented sector during the 1990s. Many people will be surprised at those figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">I commend the Minister on introducing comprehensive legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_882">I welcome the Bill, although it is probably a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. In many towns outside Dublin there is a surplus of rented accommodation, so many of the problems the Minister is hoping to solve with the Bill will be solved by people now having a choice of rented accommodation. The Bill was needed five or six years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The Bill became necessary because of the housing crisis that began in 1996. If there had been a proper supply of houses, people would not have been under pressure to rent. When one needs rented accommodation, one will take what one gets and not argue. One will also pay as much as one can afford. People did not have an option to complain because they were afraid they would lose their accommodation. I welcome the Bill but it is a pity we had to wait so long for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">I have to address some of the comments made by Deputy Conor Lenihan. It is a pity he is not present. He seems to have run away quickly after making his contribution. He said that nobody could have anticipated the housing crisis and that it only happened in 1997. Not everyone could have anticipated it but some people did. Developers bought the land so they obviously anticipated it. Why else would they buy land? Even if I can forgive the Deputy and his Government for not anticipating the crisis, I cannot forgive them for doing nothing in the seven years since it began. House prices have increased by approximately 150% since 1996. People did not cop on just last year that there was a housing crisis, this was known since 1997 and 1998. Deputy Lenihan should not try to avoid the issue by saying the Government did not anticipate the problem. A good Government must have the ability to react at the time and not years later. There is no point closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. Not having the ability to react is a failure of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Deputy Lenihan said that the 200,000 people or so who returned home during the so-called good years added to the housing crisis. Many of these people regret returning home because they believe they were conned. They were invited home by the Tánaiste. They came home to a housing crisis, transport crisis, health crisis and child care crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_890">I am stating the facts, and if the Minister of State cannot face up to the facts there is no point in sitting here listening to me. He should take a break for a while. These people are sorry they came home. They borrowed money, took out mortgages and got badly stung. They were delighted to go back. It was not because of the weather they wanted to return to Australia or America but because of hardship and the lack of help.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">One aspect I welcome is that it will no longer be necessary for people to take their grievances to court. People will be able to put their argument and the board will make a decision. This should be extended to the rental sector. I am aware of a lady who returned home from America and who has a problem in regard to the house she is buying. There is an argument about two metres of ground in the back garden. This argument has been going on for years and it is not being resolved. The only way the lady can resolve the problem is to take the case to court. We should consider setting up an arbitration service to deal with these and other issues. Councillors and Deputies are approached constantly about issues such as garden fences being in the wrong place or a tree blocking someone's view. These are social issues that could be solved outside the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Deputy Lenihan said this is a progressive Government which solves problems. I do not know what country he is talking about because I have not come across such a Government. Perhaps it is somewhere Deputy Lenihan went on holidays.</p>

I am sure the Minister of State will dispute the figures, but there are approximately 2,000 people on the housing waiting list in each county. There are at least 4,000 or 5,000 people homeless and living on the streets. These people are also waiting for houses, even though they would settle for any type of accommodation. Has the Minister of State spent many nights on the streets? I have, and I have spoken to these people. I will bring him out one night and he can walk the streets and meet them.</p>

It is not the only one of these hotels that is empty. Rumour has it that it costs approximately €400,000 to secure it each year. The Government has an empty hotel just sitting there while there are homeless people on the streets. I must question the comment that it is a progressive Government. These hotels would help to relieve the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">It was stated that people would not vote for Fine Gael because they did not believe our comments, so they voted for Fianna Fáil.

The people were, sadly, let down, and that is a pity. I have no fear that during the local and European elections next June, and the subsequent election, people will turn to parties other than Fianna Fáil.

The proof of this is obvious because there is now a housing crisis. Fianna Fáil stumbled through the last election and the housing crisis still exists. When the Taoiseach was stuck for something to say in Sligo or Galway, he said he would make it easier to obtain planning permission and release State land to build housing, which I hope he does. This is a great idea because it will reduce the cost of sites. I hope he will do it in Gormanston and other areas around Dublin. If he fulfils his promise we will probably see these houses in three or three and a half years' time – more than likely there will be an election in that time.

          <p eId="para_936">The Bill provides that landlords are required to maintain the structure and interior of the rented dwelling to the standard existing at the commencement of the tenancy. However, no investigation is carried out at the beginning. It is at the discretion of the local authority whenever it has the time to do it. Where is the standard recorded for the commencement of the tenancy? Landlords must apply to the board to be registered within the first month. I have no problem with that. Would it be useful, during that first month, when getting the property checked out by the local authority, if landlords were to include a certificate with their application? That might speed things up as the property would be checked out at the beginning, while a certificate may save paperwork in the long-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Regardless of when council staff have to check out a property, does the Minister realise the amount of work involved and the additional staff and resources that will be required? Local authorities are already under-funded by Government with the result that they cannot maintain their own council houses. That is another issue. We are setting two standards here. The legislation is concerned with private rented accommodation and it will require private landlords to have their properties up to standard, yet many local authority houses, which ultimately belong to the State, are not up to standard. Deputy Brady is aware of this, having raised the issue at many meetings of his local authority. In some properties the windows are falling out, there are no gutters, no central heating and so on.</p>

The Bill provides that some of the money from the registration fee will go to local authorities. How much, or what percentage? I have seen no figures to indicate what the board will cost to run. The registration cost per tenant is €70. Is that charge sufficient? I would like to see the figures, including the amount the local authority will get. While they will be given money to support their activities, they will probably have to increase the rates or raise money in another way. In view of this, is this another example of legislation that will not be implemented? While it is a good Bill, there is no point in passing it if its provisions are to be ignored.</p>

          <p eId="para_950">The Bill states that the landlord must ensure tenants fulfil their obligations to their neighbours and third parties. What can landlords do? I appreciate they can probably terminate the contract by giving notice, but what will happen in unusual cases? For example, I recently encountered a case where the tenants involved were killing goats in the back garden because of their differing religious beliefs. That would not be healthy. While it is an extreme case, landlords often do not know what to do in such circumstances. What must they do to fulfil their obligations under the legislation? Will they always have to the board and, if so, will it take months to resolve the matter, as happens in cases before An Bord Pleanála, or will decisions be made quickly? Can landlords do certain things without going to the board? I ask the Minister to clarify this aspect. Landlords are reluctant to act because such cases constitute a grey area and they do not know what they can or cannot do.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">If a tenant forces the landlord to breach his obligations, what is the punishment for the tenant, apart from being given notice to quit? The Bill provides that the tenant cannot sublet without permission from the landlord. What happens if the landlord refuses permission? Does he have to approach the board again? To whom would the subletee be responsible? Is he responsible to the original landlord or to the person who is subletting?</p>

          <p eId="para_953">In regard to the six months probation period and the four year tenancy, is it envisaged that another six months' probation will be allowed after the four year period has expired? If the same person is willing to rent for another four years will he or she be allowed a shorter period, say of two or three months? It is unfair that they would have to have to go through a second six months period during which time they could be put out of their home. If a tenant has proved himself or herself in the first four years there should be no need for a second six months probation period if they are to rent again.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">I have a concern regarding the notice to quit by the landlord after the six months probation period on the basis of the property being sold, change of use, refurbishment or occupancy by a family member. It is easy to put up a "For Sale" sign. The Bill recognises this can happen. If the tenancy is ended and the reason proves to be false the tenant can claim compensation but that does not solve their housing problem. It would be too easy for the landlord to state that he or she could not get the market value. Therefore, an explanation should be given to the tenant in writing stating why they are being asked to quit. They would then have proof if it turns out that they were asked to leave under false circumstances. This would do away with grey areas. Rather than compensate the tenant, could the tenant be given the first option to return to the house in the event that the landlord takes down the "For Sale" sign a week later and does not sell the property?</p>

I spoke to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, about planning permission and he has some ideas that he will apply across the board. What about making some of the council housing schemes more accessible? The shared ownership scheme is out of date. Two people on a reasonably good wage who could not afford to borrow to buy a house will not pass the shared ownership test. They will get caught in the middle. It needs to be re-examined with a view to making changes, including to the income limits.</p>

          <p eId="para_976">The houses being constructed by local authorities with money from the State are ten times better than those in the private sector. That is a credit to recent Governments which have seen a wrong righted. We all know that the quality 20 and 30 years ago was deplorable, whereas the houses today are of a very high quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">The Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 provides for the legislative reforms of the private rented sector recommended by the commission on the private rented residential sector and accepted by the Government. It introduces a significant measure of security of tenure for tenants, specifies minimum obligations applying to landlords and tenants and provides for the establishment of a private residential tenancies board to resolve disputes arising in the sector, to operate a system of tenancy registration and to provide information and policy advice. The Bill restricts rents to market level and also contains provisions for procedures for the termination of tenancies, including gradated notice periods linked to the duration of a tenancy. There are also some consequential changes to other legislation, including the Landlord and Tenant Acts and the Housing Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Part 1 contains the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as commencement, interpretation, service of notices, offences, regulations and orders, expenses, and the scope of the Bill. The Bill does not apply to formerly rent controlled and long occupation lease tenancies and holidays, employment-related or business lettings. It also does not apply to owner-occupied or social housing or where one of the occupants of the dwelling is the landlord. However, it may apply to rented dwellings where a lease or written tenancy agreement has been entered into and the landlord's spouse, child or parent is a resident.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Part 2 of the Bill specifies explicit obligations that apply to landlords and tenants of all tenancies regardless of whether there is a written tenancy agreement. It imposes an explicit requirement on landlords to maintain the structure and the interior to the standard that applied at the commencement of the letting. There is a corresponding responsibility on the tenant to remedy any disrepair – other than normal wear and tear – attributable to the tenant's acts or omissions. The obligations applying to tenants include a prohibition on anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">There is an explicit onus on landlords to enforce tenant obligations. Failure to do so will enable another party, who can show that he or she is adversely affected by the tenant's non-compliance with the tenancy obligations, to refer a complaint to the board concerning the landlord's failure to enforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">Part 3 deals with rent setting and reviewing, on the basis of market rent. The rent payable may not be greater than the open market rate as defined in the Bill. Rent reviews should be no more frequent than once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation in the interim. Rents may be reviewed upwards or downwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Part 4 provides for security of tenure on the basis of four year cycles whereby tenancies will be deemed terminated at the end of each four year period and a new tenancy will come into being. Assuming the dwelling continues to be let to the same persons for the first six months of each tenancy, the landlord will be free to terminate without giving a reason. For the remaining three and a half years, termination will be possible only where one of the grounds specified in the Bill applies. These include tenant failure to comply with obligations, proposed sale, occupation by the owner or a family member, change of use or major renovation of the premises. The first cycle of these tenancies is called a "Part 4 tenancy" and each subsequent one is called a "further Part 4 tenancy" in the Bill. The tenant will be free to terminate at any time, subject to any fixed-term agreement. A Schedule to the Bill contains aspects of the application of the security of tenure measure to sub-tenancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Part 5 specifies the procedures to be followed to terminate validly a tenancy. Termination is to be by way of a termination notice, regardless of the reason for the termination. The Part introduces gradated notice periods linked to the duration of the tenancy, ranging from four weeks in the initial six months to 16 weeks after four years. These apply to landlords and tenants. It also details the procedures applicable where a sub-tenancy has been created out of the tenancy that is being terminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">Part 6 outlines procedures for the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants. The principal function being assigned to the private residential tenancies board being established under Part 8 is the resolution of all disputes arising between landlords and tenants of dwellings to which this Bill applies. This means that the board's dispute resolution function will replace the current role of the courts in dealing with such matters for these tenancies. The board will, for example, deal with disputes about the refund of deposits with which the Small Claims Court now deals, disputes about breaches of tenancy obligations whether arising from the provisions of this Bill or under tenancy agreements and disputes surrounding the termination of tenancies in accordance with the provisions of this Bill. The board will deal with cases involving rent arrears and disputes about whether a rent sought exceeds market rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">The dispute resolution procedures to be followed by the board have been refined and developed from those described in the report of the commission on the private residential sector by the <i>ad hoc</i> private residential tenancies board, established by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal. The process will consist of two stages. Stage one is either mediation or adjudication and is confidential, and stage two is a public hearing by a tenancy tribunal. The tribunal is composed of three persons drawn from the board's dispute resolution committee.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_986">I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the litany of worrying problems that have beset an important school in my own constituency, one of the largest rural schools in my county, if not in the country, namely Kilmore Central School.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">When the central heating system broke down in this school last Thursday, that was just the latest in a long litany of disasters that have created great difficulty for teachers, pupils and parents. Some 18 months ago, the boiler in the school was replaced, having been comprehensively checked out by representatives of the Department of Education and Science. The assessment at that time was that the central heating pipes were rotten and needed to be replaced. However, only the boiler was replaced and, as predicted 18 months ago, the pipes burst this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">The school has now been forced to close, and it is predicted that it will take about ten days to carry out the comprehensive job that needs to be done to replace the central heating system and all the pipes. The school management has no option but to close the school for this period. That is a scandal, considering the rights of parents and the rights of the school pupils to be properly educated, and also considering the predictability of this emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">In February 2000 the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, called to the school and said that its deficiencies, all of which were pointed out to him, would be rectified immediately. In May 2000, shortly before the general election, the school was formally notified that all required remedial works would be carried out before the end of the year 2000. What happened in 2001 was that asbestos panels were removed from part of the school and replaced with plywood panels. The school was given a firm assurance at that time that those temporary plywood fixtures would be replaced with permanent fixtures within six weeks. That was in 2001. Needless to say, that was the last the school heard of them and the last the school heard from the Department. Those plywood temporary repairs are still in place and are now rotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">The windows were to be replaced at the same time. No action was taken. The school's suspended ceiling, put up in 1972, is falling down. Lumps are falling on the school floors, leaving holes overhead. In other areas the ceiling is bulging, and in one area of the general purposes room the ceiling is being held up by a pole strategically placed under one particular dangerous bulge.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">All of this constitutes a shameful litany of neglect and inaction. False promises were given which now demand an immediate and comprehensive response from the Department of Education and Science. What is required tonight is that the Minister of State should give this House, and more importantly the children and parents of Kilmore School, firm assurances of immediate action to put right all the wrongs with this defective building.</p>

With reference to Deputy Howlin's last remark, the Deputy knows me as a person who would like to give a comprehensive reply to all the ills, as he put it, of the school. Unfortunately, the Deputy knows the manner in which Adjournment Debates are raised and dealt with, and before me tonight is the issue of the heating system.</p>

        <heading>Flags of Convenience.</heading>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_489">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1006">I thank the Minister of State for attending. The term "flag of convenience" has always held very negative connotations regarding corporate ownership and governance, the wages and conditions of mariners, the condition of ancient vessels and the damage sometimes done to the environment. Yet the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Ahern, stands accused in recent weeks of allowing the Irish tricolour to become a flag of convenience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">During October 2003, five elderly foreign vessels have been placed on the Irish Register of Shipping and I am informed that a sixth similar vessel is in the process of being added. The owner companies of these ships and their managers are based abroad, and Ireland is therefore taking on a classic flag of convenience role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">These ships have been described to me as "six superannuated bangers". They include the <i>B. Europa,</i>which is 21 years old, owned by a company in Madeira, Portugal with business connections in Lugano, Switzerland, the <i>Bio Bio,</i>26 years old, owned by Navalmar of the UK with a manager based in Marina di Carrara, Italy, the <i>Med Lerici,</i>25 years old, owned again from Marina di Carrara in Italy, the <i>Silkeborg,</i>25 years old, again owned from Marina di Carrara; and finally the <i>Vigo Stone,</i> an amazing 31 years old, also owned by the B Navi Spa company and managed by Mr. Lorenzo Klun. All five of these vessels are now registered to the port of Cork. A sixth vessel, the <i>Med Salvador</i> from the old Malta and Turkey registers, is also said to be in the process of registering under the Irish flag.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The Irish tricolour flag has always been regarded as a small quality operator with around 32 ships owned by Irish-based companies such as Irish Ferries, and the Nolan and Arklow companies. Foreign operators are registering vessels here who do not even have a brass nameplate in Cork or any other Irish port and the registrations of the past month seem like a sudden descent by Ireland into flag of convenience status. These operators seem to have been attracted to Ireland by the tonnage tax changes introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, a few years ago. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has singly failed in his responsibility to introduce the necessary regulatory changes with regard to company and management location and other aspects of maintaining the standards of the Irish registry of shipping.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The matter was brought to my attention through the concerns of Irish master mariners and marine insurers. There are concerns over the ability of Irish marine surveyors to inspect ancient bulker ships which may never even visit Ireland and there are also grave worries with regard to the pay and conditions of crews. The environment could be in danger if anything happened to any of these ships. Given the Minister's recent public gyrations with regard to ancient US ships being towed through Irish waters, I regard it as amazing incompetence by the same Minister to permit equally elderly vessels to be registered in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">The national maritime flags which the International Transport Workers' Federation has declared to be flags of convenience include the flags of Belize, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Comoros, Gibraltar, Lebanon, Liberia, Malta, Mauritius, Panama, Sri Lanka, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Tonga. Sadly the Irish tricolour is in danger of being added to this list. Over the past 50 years, ITF, the global union federation of transport workers, represented in this country by SIPTU, has waged a strong campaign against the use of flags of convenience. It has compiled a fine report on this subject. The review committee on the future development of the Irish register under Mr. Paraic White, the distinguished former public servant, advocated some measures for the expansion of the Irish registry but I do not think the committee included what happened in the last six weeks. Unfortunately now, many badly-paid and badly-treated workers and mariners will be allowed to work in these conditions under the flag that stands behind the Chair in this Chamber and is the symbol of our nation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_490">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_1012">I wish to apologise for the absence of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is out of the country on official business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">The operation of the Irish ship register is governed by the Mercantile Marine Act 1955, as amended by the Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1998. Last July the Government approved the drafting of legislation to overhaul existing ship registration procedures. The proposed legislation will take account of developments in the shipping industry in recent years and will maintain the Irish ship register as a quality register meeting the highest international standards. So called "flags of convenience" are, <i>inter alia,</i> ship registers with lenient requirements regarding crewing of ships and documentation on ownership of ships. Private companies run these registers and some countries allow their flags to be flown on such ships. I reject the suggestion that the Irish flag is becoming a flag of convenience following recent additions to the Irish ship register. Unlike the lax control regimes normally associated with flags of convenience, Ireland operates a high quality and highly regulated regime in accordance with best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">In order for a ship to be registered on the Irish flag there are two parallel processes required. The first of these is for the owner to contact the registrar of shipping at the chosen port of registry. The customs and excise officials of the Revenue Commissioners are the designated registrars of shipping on behalf of the Department. The registrar establishes the owner's eligibility to register, including whether they are Irish or EU citizens or bodies corporate. Once the owner's eligibility to register has been established, the ship is subject to a risk analysis and detailed survey by the Department's maritime safety directorate. Under this assessment and survey process the ship's present flag of registration, its age and current and previous histories are examined. The ship's compliance with international and EU requirements and conventions are assessed through the very detailed technical survey that takes place. It is only after this process that a decision to accept registration of the ship on the Irish flag is taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">As the Deputy will be aware, under EU law any EU citizen or body corporate can place a ship on any EU ship register. This means that any EU-based company or operator can place a ship on the Irish ship register if the operator and the ship meet our stringent regulatory requirements. I stress that all ships recently placed on the Irish ship register have satisfied these requirements. Once accepted and on the Irish flag, all ships are subject to annual surveys in accordance with EU and international requirements. Irish flagged ships are also subject to port state control inspections when they enter ports of other states. Ireland has a good record in this regard and it is in the top ten of international flag states, which I am confident will be a source of pride for the Members of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">If Deputy Broughan has any specific allegations to make concerning the infringement of any of the stringent criteria here outlined, he should substantiate them fully. Ireland operates a high quality and highly regulated regime in accordance with best international practice.</p>

        <heading>Home Births.</heading>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_491">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_1018">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue. I was quite shocked by the decision of the Supreme Court to award costs against Sarah Clarke, Melissa Lockhart, Anne Brannick and Caroline O'Brien, who had appealed against an earlier High Court judgment of September 2002. The Supreme Court decision of 21 October 2003 was itself a serious blow to those who promote home birth in this country, and indeed against those of us who advocate equality of access to health care. It now means that women who can afford it can have a home birth by paying a midwife privately, while those who are not financially well off are forced to have a hospital birth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">This is further evidence of our two-tiered health system. The awarding of costs sends the clearest signal yet that those who seek to vindicate their rights in the area of home birth in the courts should be extremely wary. No doubt those in the medical establishment who are opposed to home birth will herald this as an important victory.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Reading section 62 of the Health Act 1970, it is very difficult to understand how the High Court and Supreme Court came to their conclusions. Section 3 is explicit and derives from the 1954 Act, a period when home birth was more prevalent. The judgment also seems to have ignored the 1988 Supreme Court judgment in a case taken by my Green Party colleague, Jeremy Wates. In that judgment, Mr. Justice Finlay made it clear that the health board had a duty of care to those who choose a home birth and that section 62 applied to "hospital or maternity home or at home". Be that as it may, the Supreme Court in its wisdom has decided to ignore this judgment and in effect to overturn the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">The only recourse the women now have is the European Court of Justice, where I hope they will get some justice, or at the very least some credible legal argument. In the meantime, it is the duty of the Government to protect the rights of all women who choose to have a home birth. The Minister for Health and Children can do this by immediately amending section 62 of the 1970 Health Act, making it absolutely clear to even the most hostile judge that section 3 covers home birth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">In response to a parliamentary question I asked yesterday, the Minister stated that the expert group set up in 1997 following the report of the maternity and infant care scheme review recommended three home birth pilot projects. An external evaluation of the three projects is to be completed shortly. The expert group will engage in a public consultation process and report in March 2004. This is being used now as an excuse by the Minister not to introduce legislation to deal with the consequences of the Supreme Court decision. Perhaps he is hoping, along with certain elements in the medical establishment, that the review would be quite negative in relation to home birth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Certainly, the comments of Dr. McKenna suggest that home birth appears to be frowned upon in certain circles. His report on the safety of home birth succeeded in frightening many people, including members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. However, there are many who are of the view that his report does not stand up to scrutiny. I understand it is to be thoroughly rebutted in an article in December by some Irish midwives and those acting for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">It is important that we have a rational debate on the issue. To my knowledge, there are many other reports that show home birth is extremely safe, is more pleasant for the woman giving birth and the after care is superior to that of a hospital. This is not to criticise the midwives and obstetricians who work in hospitals who are under enormous pressure, so much so that they are often forced to get women in and out of maternity hospital as quickly as possible. Perhaps this accounts for the highly interventionist approach in Irish maternity hospitals. Caesarean section rates are very high, as are the number of inductions. If the Minister is serious about increasing breast feeding rates, he ought to promote home birth as breast feeding rates among home birth mothers are much higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">If the Minister fails to amend the Health Act 1970 to ensure equality of access to home birth, the Green Party will take up the challenge by introducing a Private Members' Bill. We will publish the Bill in the next two weeks and I am certain the Home Birth Alliance will lobby political parties to support it. I hope the Minister will reconsider his position and, if he is serious about promoting home birth, as the Tánaiste claimed in a reply to me recently, he will accept the Bill when we bring it before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I congratulate the women for their courageous stance and thank those who have given so much time and energy to the cause of home birth, including Anne Kelly, Philomena Canning and Marie O'Connor. They have had to endure difficult times in recent years but I am confident their struggle will be rewarded and they will get what they deserve – justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_1027">I welcome this debate. Deputy Gormley touched on many issues and I will refer to some statistics on the safest options for child birth. It is important when dealing with issues of this nature that we do so on an informed basis.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_1029">The judgment by the Supreme Court, delivered on 5 November, involved four appeals of refusals by the High Court to grant a judicial review, the effect of which would have been to compel the respondent health boards to provide or fund home midwifery services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">In all four cases, leave to bring judicial review proceedings was granted on the grounds that section 62 of the Health Act 1970 creates a legally enforceable right. Counsel for the women involved argued that although there is no explicit provision in section 62 of the Health Act 1970 that compels a health board to provide for home births, such an obligation must be read into the section by implication. I note that Mr. Justice Geoghegan dismissed all four appeals stating that he could find nothing in section 62 to justify interpreting it as creating such an obligation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">In one of the cases a second point was considered – that it is discriminatory for one health board not to provide home midwifery services of a kind which other health boards do provide. This refers to a 1998 request from the Ombudsman that all health boards apply a standardised approach to applicants for home birth services. On foot of this request, the Department asked the health boards to make the same <i>ex gratia</i> payment to applicants who engage an independent midwife to attend a home birth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">Following a High Court ruling in 2001, however, the Department was advised that health boards in the eastern region had departed from the agreed <i>ex gratia</i> system. The East Coast Area Health Board suspended payment of grants in respect of applicants whose medical, practical or geographical circumstances would exclude them from qualification from the DOMINO/home birth pilot project in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street. The applicant in that case had been found unsuitable by the health board for a home birth by reason of the distance of her home from the nearest maternity hospital. In the recent case the applicant's estimated travel time from home to the nearest maternity hospital was again a factor in considering her claim for a home birth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Mr. Justice Geoghegan, when considering this point, stated that section 62 does not lay down a national prescription as to how these services are to be provided and that unless a health board was to adopt a wholly unreasonable policy, its decisions in this regard cannot be impugned. He went on to say:</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">There appears to be nothing unreasonable in the policy of the East Coast Area Health Board. It is irrelevant that some other health boards may provide limited home midwifery services. There is no unfair, unlawful or, still less, unconstitutional discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I am advised that the 2001 High Court ruling is being appealed to the Supreme Court. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on health boards' current practices with regard to the home birth grant until all legal issues are resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">The Department's policy is that birth in a consultant-staffed maternity unit is the safest option both for mothers and babies. It is generally accepted that this policy has contributed to the marked decrease in the level of maternal, perinatal and infant mortality.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_1038">For example, the maternal mortality rate decreased from 24.8 per 100,000 live births and still births in 1971 to 1.8 in 2000. The perinatal mortality rate fell from 22.8 per 1,000 live births and still births in 1971 to 9.0 in 2000, while the infant mortality rate fell from 18.0 per 1,000 births to 5.8 in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The report of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme Review Group in 1994 endorsed the Department's policy that the safest place to give birth is in a well equipped and staffed maternity hospital or unit, but also recognised that arrangements must be made for those who wish to give birth at home. The group suggested possible approaches to the provision of a home birth service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The then Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, in April 1997 announced, "Each approach is to be piloted in a health board to establish feasibility and comparative effectiveness, or whether different approaches may be required in different geographic or demographic circumstances."  The following pilot projects were later established and funded by the Department of Health and Children: a community midwifery service, conducted in Cork by the Southern Health Board; a hospital outreach approach conducted by the Western Health Board based at the University College Hospital, Galway; and a DOMINO/outreach project – domiciliary care in and out of hospital – based at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">These pilot projects are now being evaluated under the auspices of the domiciliary births group, which was established by the chief executive officers group earlier this year at the request of my Department, with the following terms of reference: to prepare an up to date progress report on the implementation of the recommendations from the expert group on domiciliary births in 1997; to make recommendations on the long-term approach arising from the outcome of the pilot schemes, and to establish protocols and procedures; and to commission an external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">The external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects in Dublin, Cork and Galway, and the service in the South-Eastern Health Board area, is due for completion shortly. The domiciliary births group will then engage in a public consultation process and report to the chief executive officers in February or March 2004. The group's report will inform the development of future national policies, procedures and protocols for domiciliary births. Bearing that in mind, consideration of the issue of legislation or regulations regarding home births should await the outcome of the deliberations of the domiciliary births group.</p>

      the reasoning for the ?73.8 million or 28% cut in the 2004 estimate for public transport safety and development; if some of this shortfall is expected to be made up by the ?121 million increase in external borrowings and EU receipts for CIE that has been signalled in the non-voted section of the 2004 public capital programme; the reason for such an increase in CIE's borrowing requirement; the way in which such debt will be held if he proceeds with the break up of the CIE group; and if he expects that there will be a difference in the interest rates payable by CIE in comparison with the rates the Exchequer could receive for similar borrowing.

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_497">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1046">The funding sources for public transport in the National Development Plan include the Exchequer, EU and CIE borrowing and other own resources. The commitment for 2004 under the public capital programme for public transport including CIE, RPA and DTO is €633 million, an increase of €49 million – 8.4% – over 2003. All of the increase relates to CIE. While the Exchequer element is reduced by €73 million, the targeted programmes will be maintained by increased borrowing by CIE for which additional subvention is being provided towards the interest charges on the borrowing. The issue of the CIE debt and its allocation is a matter that will be dealt with in the overall proposals for the restructuring of the company.</p>

          <p eId="para_1050">The construction of a rail tunnel connecting Heuston Station and the East Wall Junction via the Docklands was one of the proposals contained in the Dublin Transportation Office strategy document, A Platform for Change, for construction in the period up to 2010. On foot of this proposal, Irish Rail engaged consultants to carry out a feasibility study relating to the interconnector tunnel. I asked Irish Rail, as part of the study, to examine the possibility of making greater use of the Phoenix Park Tunnel. The study has now been completed and yesterday my Department received formal proposals from Irish Rail in that regard. My Department plans to hold discussions with the company in the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 27906/03 about EU Commission infringement proceedings relating to the procurement of safety barriers, the position on safety barrier standards is that the NRA's current road design standards provide for high containment safety barriers in central medians up to 7.5m in width; normal containment safety barriers in central medians greater than 7.5m wide but not exceeding 15m in width; and where the median width is greater than 15m no safety barrier is required as the median itself provides the safety mechanism.

However, a contract variation was ordered, earlier this year, on the Glen of the Downs and the Ashford-Rathnew scheme for the installation of a median barrier complying with EN 1317. Approximately 2.3 km of normal containment barrier and 4 km of high containment barrier have been installed along the median on the Glen of the Downs project. Safety barriers on the Rathnew-Ashford bypass and on all future road improvement schemes on the N11 and elsewhere will be provided in accordance with the current NRA standard and will comply with the European standard EN 1317.</summary>

This compares with the original contractual dates of October 2003 for line A and December 2003 for line B.

The budget was revised in February 2001 to €675 million – composed of €338 million for line A, €295 million for line B and €42 million for line C – plus a risk provision of €89 million to take account of actual competitive tender prices received, reflecting high inflation in the construction sector, higher than anticipated property acquisition costs and changes to the scope of the project, mainly related to the provision for upgrading line B to metro status.</p>

The reasons for the increase of €16 million is accounted for by the higher than anticipated costs associated with the demolition of the Connolly ramp and increases in the costs of utilities and enabling works. The RPA have informed me that the project is within the €691 million budget and risk provision, as notified to the Government in December 2002.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1062">A high quality and efficient public transport system is essential to sustaining the economic and social progress made in Ireland in recent years. To this end this Government has in recent years increased State financial support for public transport services to historically high levels. However, as in many areas of the public sector, Exchequer investment alone is not sufficient to deliver the level and quality of public service, which the current generation of Irish people expect and rightly demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">The regulatory framework for the bus market in Ireland dates back over 70 years to the Road Transport Act 1932. In the intervening period the environment for the provision of public transport services and the demands of those using public transport has changed significantly. The regulatory model for public transport needs to reflect a more sophisticated and effective approach, which takes full account of the economic and social changes of the past decade and provides a better framework for the years ahead. We must look for greater accountability and customer responsiveness in our public services.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_32">It was in this context that I set out my policy objectives for public transport reform in my November 2002 statement to the public transport partnership forum and to the Oireachtas Committee on Transport in June 2003. These detailed proposals can be summarised as follows: as Minister I will continue to set the overall regulatory policy and approve the broad public transport investment strategy; within that regulatory and investment framework, an independent body will be established to procure public transport services, regulate public transport and allocate current and capital funding for specific purposes from an overall allocation provided by the Exchequer; franchising will be the primary means of procuring bus services in the greater Dublin area; the independent body will also regulate public transport fares and set and enforce quality standards for public transport services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_33">CIE will be dissolved and Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann, and Iarnrod Éireann will be established as independent commercial State companies with strong commercially focused boards. There are no plans to privatise any of the three CIE operating companies. Arrangements will be made to redeploy staff who work in the holding company.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1067">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 38 and 63 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The National Development Plan 2000-06 envisages that a proportion of the national roads programme will be implemented by means of public private partnerships, which will involve private sector funding remunerated in part by user tolls and will ensure earlier delivery of vital national road infrastructure. Through PPPs, private sector innovation will be harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance. User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required. It is considerably more widely used in roads financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The development and implementation of national road PPP projects is a matter for the NRA within the statutory and administrative framework provided by the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002 and Department of Finance interim guidelines on the assessment, approval and procurement of PPP projects. Within this statutory and administrative framework, it is a matter for the NRA to negotiate PPP agreements for the funding, construction and operation of toll funded national road projects. The NRA carries out extensive financial, legal and technical evaluation for each national road project to be procured on a PPP basis. This evaluation focuses on ensuring that value for money is obtained. A project will not be undertaken on a PPP basis unless it provides better value for money than would be obtained under conventional procurement. The NRA's current PPP programme comprises 11 projects spread throughout the country. It is expected that user tolls on these projects will leverage private sector funding of approximately €1.15 billion over the period 2004-08.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_35">The amount of €150 million in external roads financing included in the public capital programme tables of the 2004 Abridged Estimates Volume is the estimated private sector investment in the N4-N6 Kilcock-Kinnegad scheme which commenced construction earlier this year; the M1 Dundalk western by-pass; the N8 Fermoy by-pass and the N25 Waterford City by-pass. It is additional to the Exchequer provision of €1.227 billion for the national roads improvement programme. Funding arrangements for the various schemes will not be determined until the relevant negotiations are finalised and tolling agreements entered into by the NRA. However, in general it is expected that PPP concessions would be of the order of 30 years duration and that they would be remunerated wholly or partly by tolls. Some construction and-or operating payments by the NRA may be necessary to allow toll charges to be set at an affordable level in order to reduce diversion and not to undermine the transportation benefits of the scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_36">The return to the concessionaire is dependant on its ability to manage the costs it will incur in the design, build and long-term operation of each scheme. Additionally, the traffic volumes that materialise on the road are a key factor in the overall return the private sector will derive from any PPP scheme. It should be noted that the PPP contract devised by the NRA also incorporates a revenue share mechanism, which serves to limit the return to the private sector in the event of traffic volumes exceeding expectations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">Funding of the PPP schemes comprises debt finance provided by the European Investment Bank and commercial funding banks along with equity finance. EIB funding is advanced to the private sector at particularly competitive rates, which are close to the cost of Government debt while the commercial debt finance on the PPP schemes has been advanced at competitive rates of 1% to 1.5% above EURIBOR. The equity investment in the schemes bid to date has been aggressively priced. Responsibility for the repayment of the debt and equity financing is a matter for the concession company.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38">As part of the PPP assessment process for an individual project undertaken by the NRA, a risk assessment is undertaken which identifies and quantifies the significant risks likely to arise on the project and considers their optimum allocation between the public and private sector. The key to achieving maximum value for money in PPP projects is to allocate risk to the party that can best manage it. In the case of national roads, risks and costs in design, construction, maintenance, traffic volumes and operation costs are generally carried by the concessionaire, while risks in relation to statutory procedures are retained by the NRA.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39">As regards the costs of tolling to the motoring public, the road projects identified by the NRA for PPP based on user toll financing will deliver time savings, journey time certainty and an overall high level of service to users for the toll charge levied. I am confident that the modest level of the tolls to be charged, combined with the high quality of the new roads and the greatly improved transport service they will provide, will ensure that the routes are attractive to the vast bulk of inter-urban traffic.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1076">The M50-N7 Red Cow roundabout frequently caters for road traffic volumes in excess of 100,000 vehicles per day. This volume of traffic gives rise to extensive queuing at peak times both on the M50 and the N7. As part of its plans for the upgrade of the M50 and to achieve major improvements in key traffic movement, I understand from the NRA that it is developing proposals for the upgrade of the M50-N7 and has had discussions with the Railway Procurement Agency in that regard. I have had detailed discussion with the NRA and the RPA with a view to ensuring an integrated response addressing traffic congestion at the junction and facilitating effective operation of Luas. I am satisfied that proposals now being rescued by the NRA will cater for free flow road traffic movements, including south bound traffic on the M50 wishing to travel towards Naas, and will seek to significantly reduce conflicting traffic movements which are a major constraint at the Red Cow interchange.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_40">Under the NRA proposals, the Luas will retain its current alignment and the sequencing of road traffic lights will give Luas longer transit times while there will be reduced potential for competing movements between Luas and road traffic at the interchange. With regard to bus prioritisation adjacent to the Red Cow roundabout, I understand that the quality bus network office of Dublin City Council is currently in discussion with the NRA in that regard.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_41">The Cork suburban rail proposals, as outlined in the Cork area strategic plan and which were the subject of a rail feasibility study, are under discussion between officials of my Department and Iarnród Éireann. The proposals form part of Iarnród Éireann's medium term rail investment programme, which was recently submitted to my Department. On the basis of these discussions I expect to soon receive more specific proposals from Iarnród Éireann with regard to the proposed rail development in Cork. In the meantime I understand from Irish Rail that a combination of timetable changes, which are due to be introduced on 14 December next, and the provision of additional new rolling stock will result in significantly improved service frequencies and capacities on the Mallow to Cork and Cobh to Cork routes.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1088">I am currently reviewing the driver testing and licensing system with a view to bringing in changes that will lead to improved driver behaviour. In the licensing area I am examining a range of reforms to address the problem of long-term reliance on provisional licences and improve the standard of driving. Regarding driver testing the Government has approved the Heads of a Bill to establish a driver testing and standards authority. I expect to be in a position to introduce the Bill into the House at an early date in the next session. While the authority's primary task will be to deliver an efficient driver testing service it will also be responsible for driving standards in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">The requirements of the practical driving test are set out in the relevant EU directive. A number of improvements to the practical driving test are in the course of implementation on foot of amendments agreed at EU level. These changes relate to random checks on mechanical aspects of vehicles which have a bearing on road safety such as tyres, steering, brakes, engine oil, coolant, washer fluid, lights, reflectors, indicators and horn. In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, is arranging for implementation of improvements in relation to truck tests, such as parking safely for loading and unloading at a loading ramp and coupling and uncoupling the vehicle. Under the relevant EU directive, further changes are also due to be introduced to the driving test by October 2005 related to manoeuvres to be carried out by motorcyclists.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_42">Proposals being developed by my Department for the regulation and quality assurance of driving instruction will involve a test of the competence of individual instructors. The design of the standard that a driving instructor must meet has been developed in consultation with a working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests. Arrangements for the registration of driving instructors are being considered in the context of the establishment of the driver testing and standards authority.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1100">I have stated consistently that I believe that every effort should be made by Irish Rail to develop its rail freight business. Since the publication of the strategic rail review earlier this year, my Department has held a number of meetings with Irish Rail at which the company has reported on its progress in improving the performance of its freight business. Irish Rail's immediate priority is to achieve financial viability for its freight business. The company's strategy is to develop the profitable traffics such as bulk cement and mineral ore concentrates and reshape the loss making container business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">Irish Rail informs me that the fortunes of its freight operations have improved considerably in recent times. It has secured two major contracts and is in the process of consolidating those markets which are financially sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">The company has stated that it is confident that the outlook for its freight business is promising in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">With regard to the allocation of individual pieces of equipment between different Irish Rail facilities, this is an operational matter for the company itself to decide. However, I understand that no plans exist to remove or replace any serviceable gantry. Individual smaller pieces of machinery can and are moved between different depots to provide necessary services from time to time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1307">I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 70 and 79 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">The strategic rail review provides the Government with a policy framework for the future development of rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland. The report's findings will have a positive role in helping to alleviate growing congestion, reverse ever-increasing car dependency, maintain economic competitiveness and prioritise balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">The western rail corridor was one of a number of schemes that was evaluated in the course of the review. While it was noted in the report that this particular scheme complements the objectives of the national spatial strategy, it did not perform well in the cost benefit and multi criteria analyses carried out in the review and so it was not included by the consultants in the recommended investment strategy.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_48">The review found that consideration of new railway proposals, such as the western rail corridor, could only be undertaken when such proposals are supported by appropriate and complementary land use, settlement and economic strategies, which would provide the economic, social and commercial rationale for such projects. At present such strategies are not in place along the rail corridor. It is important to recall that rail lines do not exist in a vacuum; they have to serve a transport purpose and it is necessary to be very clear as to the purpose when discussions take place in relation to a western rail corridor.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_49">As the western rail corridor fits in well with the aims of the national spatial strategy, I provided the relevant regional authorities in the west with consultancy advice from Booz Allen Hamilton who undertook the strategic rail review to ensure that they are fully aware of the necessary prerequisites that would need to be put in place before a rail feasibility study could be commissioned on the corridor.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">In September last officials from my Department organised a seminar in Athlone, together with Booz Allen Hamilton, to outline, to the regional authorities in the Border, West, Mid-West and South-West Regional Authority areas, the context in which the western rail corridor was considered within the overall strategic rail review. The seminar also dealt with the critical land use and settlement issues in order to assist the regional authorities in their consideration of appropriate strategies that might support the western rail corridor.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">The seminar was very timely as the regional authorities are currently in the process of drawing up regional planning guidelines for their regions as part of the implementation of the national spatial strategy. The seminar provided the opportunity to discuss the Western Rail proposal with the regional authorities in the context of such regional planning guidelines. The seminar has been followed by direct one-to-one discussions between Booz Allen Hamilton and each of the regional authorities and the Western Development Commission. My officials have also had a separate meeting with the commission with regard to the western rail corridor.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">It is now a matter for the regional authorities to consider the potential for rail developments, such as the western rail corridor, in the drafting of their regional planning guidelines. However, I have to stress that such proposals must be supported by land use and settlement strategies, developed by the regional authorities, which underpin and support the rail proposals if they are to have any chance of success. My Department is represented on each of the regional authorities preparing these guidelines and I have asked Irish Rail to facilitate the regional authorities in their work, as they have in the case of the rail feasibility study for Cork.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1319">It is now just over one year since penalty points for speeding were first introduced. At the end of October 2003, over 66,700 drivers had received penalty points for speeding offences since the introduction of the system in October 2002. The number of road deaths during the first year of the operation of the penalty points system was 333 compared to 409 for the corresponding 12-month period in the previous year. This represents the saving of 76 lives – nearly 19% – since the introduction of the system. At the end of October no driver had accumulated the 12 point threshold which leads to automatic disqualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">The full application of the penalty points system will be achieved when the relevant IT systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are completed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1350">The programme for Government provides for the continued support of our six regional airports and for regional air access. My Department provides three sources of financial assistance in support of this objective, namely, subvention of the PSO services which facilitate air access to the regions concerned, the allocation of assistance towards marketing, safety and security related expenditure incurred by the regional airports, and capital grant assistance towards infrastructural improvements under the regional operational programmes of the NDP.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_57">A renewed three year PSO air services programme to the regional airports was launched last year in accordance with the programme for Government and regular PSO air services are now operating to the regional airports. The review of air services supported by the essential air service programme – PSO air services – was commissioned by the Department in March 2003 under the Government's expenditure review initiative. The review was undertaken by DKM Economic Consultants and was completed in May 2003. I am considering the outcome of this study with a view to determining my future approach to the PSO regime and hope to outline my decision on this issue shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">My Department provides grants to the six regional airports towards the costs of marketing, safety and security measures at those airports. I allocated €2.24 million under this grant scheme for 2003. Grant-aid of approximately €9.2 million has already been approved under first round allocations under the regional airports measure of the NDP. I expect that the first round of approved projects, currently being funded under the regional airports measure of the NDP, will be completed by mid-2004. The primary objective of this measure is to facilitate continued safe and viable operations at the regional airports. In light of prevailing budgetary constraints, a new round of projects will be considered for funding under the measure as soon as the regional airport companies draw down existing allocations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">The scale of Exchequer assistance to the regional airports will have to be carefully assessed. The review of the PSO regime to which I have already referred points to the escalating costs of that regime and questions whether it is achieving its policy objectives. I stress, however, that my objective is to create a reasonably level playing field between the six regional airports, on the one hand, and Shannon and Cork airports on the other. The legislation I am preparing to give effect to the airport restructuring will provide for revised regulatory arrangements to achieve this objective. The Government's commitment to supporting the regional airports is not in question.</summary>

I have received the outline business case for phase 1 from the Railway Procurement Agency, which involves a line from the airport to the city centre. This business case contains commercially sensitive information, which the RPA regards as confidential and which, they believe, if made available to outside interests, could influence potential bidders for the project in a way which could run counter to the interests of the Exchequer. The Railway Procurement Agency has, therefore, indicated to me that there are aspects of the business case which they wish to remain confidential between the RPA and my Department and I now accept this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport has recently commissioned a report on the metro. My Department, the Railway Procurement Agency and the Dublin Transportation Office have met with the consultants who are assisting the committee. I understand that the committee's report will be completed shortly and I look forward to receiving it and taking account of the views of the committee before bringing my proposals on the metro to the Government in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">In preparing a submission for the Government on this matter I will have considered the viability of all alternative solutions. Again, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any of these alternatives in advance of Government deliberations on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">Platform for Change provides an overall planning framework for the development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area. It is not a detailed blueprint for each of the individual projects and programmes being considered for implementation. It is the responsibility of the Dublin Transportation Office to keep the framework under continuing review and to advise on updating when required.</p>

          <p eId="para_1378">As I have stated in the past I am anxious to consider the genuine concerns of CIE employees regarding the reform of public transport and the future of CIE and how it might impact on their livelihoods and future careers. But it must also be recognised that these interests need to be balanced against the requirements of public transport users and the wider national interest in an efficient and effective public transport system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">In this context and arising from a meeting I had with ICTU leaders in July, phased discussions on public transport regulatory reform involving officials of my Department and representatives of the CIE unions recommenced on 10 September 2003. Parallel discussions are also taking place with the managements of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann. The initial phase of discussions focused on the principles of public transport policy, phase two on the regulatory framework and the final phase will focus on the detailed aspects of regulatory reform of public transport. Three meetings have taken place to date, most recently on 1 October, and further meetings are planned at dates to be agreed. I understand from officials in my Department that the discussions to date have progressed reasonably well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">It was agreed that the current discussions would focus primarily on regulatory reform. However, it is intended that there will be discussions with the trade unions in due course on the restructuring of CIE. In the meantime, my Department is continuing its technical preparatory work on both regulatory reform and CIE restructuring.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">As I have indicated on a number of occasions previously, it is my intention to proceed with the necessary legislation in 2004.</p>

A second round of negotiations is due to take place in Brussels in December. During these negotiations, a special committee made up of all member states will assist the Commission. Ireland is represented on this committee by a senior official from my Department. It is unclear how long these negotiations will take.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">In dealing with this issue, I must also take account of wider considerations, especially the opportunities for new business for Ireland currently not being exploited due to the limitation on the number of US destinations open to Irish airlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">The recent report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism recommends that my Department should immediately renegotiate the Ireland-US international air agreement in advance of an EU-US agreement in order to remove the present US gateways restriction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">Change in this area is inevitable. Officials in my department are in discussions with their US counterparts on the Ireland-US Bilateral. Officials are currently engaging, on my behalf, with the trade unions representing airport staff, and I will shortly be consulting the new board-designate of Shannon Airport. When these consultations are concluded, I will decide on the next steps.</p>

          <p eId="para_1429">The ESRI mid term evaluation of the national development plan endorses the priority which has been accorded to investment in transport infrastructure, confirms the positive contribution of this investment to economic growth and competitiveness and recommends an increase in investment in transport infrastructure, particularly in national roads. In addition, the ESRI identified a number of concerns in relation to the national roads and public transport investment programmes. In particular it emphasised the importance of strengthening cost estimation and control systems and procedures; recommended, in relation to national roads, reconsideration of the road standard mandated in the national development plan for the five major inter-urban routes; recommended the consideration of congestion charging in urban areas; emphasised that decisions on user toll based road PPPs should be based on value for money considerations; recommended that mainline rail projects already committed should proceed but others should await deliberations on the strategic rail review and that rail safety and mainline track renewal projects should not be undertaken without proper economic cost benefit analysis; emphasised the need to improve the use of suburban rail capital stock through frequency improvements and appropriate physical planning guidelines in urban areas to optimise usage of infrastructure and recommended that in planning future public transport investments in Dublin, expensive rail projects which take a long time to deliver need to be rigorously examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">The conclusions and recommendations of the report in relation to the foregoing issues will be carefully considered by my Department and its agencies. It will be particularly important in the ongoing implementation of the transport infrastructure investment programmes to continue to give a high priority to strengthening cost estimation and control, securing greater certainty in outturn cost and ensuring best value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">In relation to the recommendation on the appropriate road type on the major inter-urban routes, it should be noted that a range of issues such as overall route standard considerations, current and projected traffic volumes, safety aspects and later upgrade costs have to be taken into account.</p>

The rural transport initiative services are now carrying in excess of 16,000 people each month and these numbers are rising as new transport services are rolled out and as existing services are developed to their full capacity.

          <p eId="para_1454">Approximately one third of requests for exemption are received from cargo carriers. The cargo contained on these flights includes items such as helicopter parts, rockets, grenades and cartridges. The items are described using their UN classification codes, UN identification numbers, and ICAO technical packing codes rather than by brand names or mark types. Accordingly it is not possible to say whether any of the munitions mentioned by the Deputy have been carried in cargo planes that have refuelled in Shannon airport. All applications for exemptions received, including details of the cargo, are submitted to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of Foreign Affairs for their observations, and to the Department of Defence for information. The application is also submitted to the Irish Aviation Authority for its observations, as the day-to-day oversight of aviation safety falls within its remit. Should any of these bodies express an objection to the operation of these flights, I would refuse to grant an exemption under the 1973 Order.</p>

The responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes lies, ultimately, with the parties concerned. It would be inappropriate for me to intervene in individual disputes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1480">The Ministerial Air Transport Service, MATS, is primarily provided by the Air Corps using a Gulfstream IV aircraft which can carry up to 14 passengers. A Beech Super King Air turboprop aircraft, which was purchased in 1980, is also made available in support of the service, on a limited basis. From time to time, when the MATS aircraft were not available, the CASA aircraft and Air Corps helicopters have been used. However, such situations arise very infrequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">The total cost of the GIV, including the cost of lease payments during the period December 1991 to December 2001 amounted to €44.06 million, inclusive of VAT. The cost of the Beech Super King Air, when purchased in 1980, was approximately €1 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482">My Department follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings, (a) the direct cost, i.e. the costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown including maintenance, fuel and support services and (b) the total cost, i.e. the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft. The figures currently being used by my Department in respect of the Gulfstream IV are a direct cost of €2,500 per flying hour and a total cost of €5,550 per flying hour. The figures currently used for the Beech Super King Air are a direct cost of €900 per flying hour and a total cost of €1,400 per flying hour, while for the CASA a direct cost of €1,000 and a total cost of €2,400 are the appropriate figures. The cost for helicopters, Dauphins, are €1700 (direct) and €2800 (total).</p>
          <p eId="para_1483">The approximate Ministerial flying hours for the GIV and other Air Corps aircraft between 1 January 2001 and 30 September 2003 are as follows:</p>

          <p eId="para_1539">The 2004 spending proposals for my Department, which were published recently, provide for gross and net allocations €1.39 billion and €935.1 million respectively. The gross estimate includes a sum of approximately €108 million for forestry, responsibility for which will transfer to my Department on 1 January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">The gross allocation for 2004 is €62.2 million, 5% higher than the corresponding 2003 figure. However, when account is taken of the reduced expenditure requirements related to BSE in 2004 arising from the improved disease situation, the gross expenditure provision for my Department for 2004 is approximately 8% higher than in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1541">The increased Exchequer funding, when considered alongside the expenditure of a further €1.6 billion on EU funded agricultural measures, including direct payments to farmers, will bring total expenditure by my Department to approximately €3 billion in 2004.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_95">My priorities for the coming years are to promote environmentally friendly and sustainable farming as well as a consumer oriented food industry, to prevent the spread of disease and to facilitate the transition to the single payment system arising from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. These priorities are reflected in particular in the 37% increase in the Exchequer provision for the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, the 31% increase in the provision for forestry and the 70% increase in the allocation for on-farm investments, notably farm waste management. The increased allocation for REPS of €260 million, up €70 million on 2003, provides for a 28% increase in average payments and will also facilitate a significant increase in the number of participants in the scheme in 2004. This reflects the Government's commitment to further enhancing this important scheme, as outlined in the partnership agreement Sustaining Progress. Funding for on-farm investment schemes and forestry amounts to €52.8 million, up €21.5 million on 2003, and €108 million, up €25.3 million on 2003, respectively.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">The lower provisions for general disease control and market supports reflect positive developments in the BSE situation and improved market conditions for agricultural products and do not represent any diminution in my Department's efforts to support developments in these areas. The improvements in these areas are welcome and are important for the future development of the industry. I am satisfied that the 2004 allocation provides appropriate resources for the schemes and programmes operated by my Department to enable it to continue to provide a high quality service to the agriculture, forestry and food sectors in 2004.</summary>

In these meetings the Commission officials have indicated that any formal request for further classification could lead to a demand for justification of Ireland's current designation and classification for all areas. The Commission's approach has its basis in negative comments by the Court of Auditors concerning the monitoring of disadvantaged areas classification and designation in the EU in general. Given this background, it is important that the timing and nature of any submission requesting extension of the disadvantaged areas be given very careful consideration.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1547">Tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the BES scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax foregone of the order of some €265 million in the last ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. In budget 2003, I referred to the generally accepted principle that such reliefs narrow the tax base and that a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to retain the current low tax rates. Consequently, all tax reliefs must be subject to ongoing review. In that context, I announced in the budget that a number of these reliefs across a range of sectors including film relief would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004.</p>

The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism has forwarded to me a copy of a study reviewing the relief that was commissioned jointly by his Department and the Irish Film Board. I have asked officials from my Department to examine this study. However, as things stand, the position with regard to the 31 December 2004 termination date for this relief remains unchanged.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1556">The rules governing income tax relief for fees paid for third level education are contained in section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_1557">In brief, the position is that tax relief, at the standard rate, may be claimed in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual to an approved college in respect of full-time or part-time undergraduate courses in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU and postgraduate courses both in Ireland and abroad. Undergraduate courses must be of at least two academic years' duration while postgraduate courses must be of at least one, but not more than four, academic years' duration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558">Tax relief is also available in respect of fees paid for training courses, of less than two years' duration, in the areas of information technology and foreign languages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559">Tuition fees paid by an individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian all qualify for relief. The relief is limited to tuition fees and is not available for maintenance, registration fees, exam fees or other expenses incurred. No relief is available for any part of fees which are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, an employer or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560">The maximum relief that can be claimed is set by the Minister for Education and Science. It is currently €3,175 per year in respect of third level fees. In the case of fees for training courses in foreign languages and information technology, the maximum relief is set at €1,270 per annum and no relief is due where the fees for the course are less than €315.</p>
          <p eId="para_1561">An individual may seek clarification from his or her local tax office as to whether or not a particular course has been approved for tax relief purposes by the Department of Education and Science, or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS in the case of training courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562">The explanatory leaflet, IT31, and application form in respect of tax relief on tuition fees is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie A list of the courses eligible for tax relief for the academic year 2003/2004 may also be found on the Revenue website under publications and lists.</p>

Statutory Instrument (SI) 353 of 1994, Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations prescribe the medical criteria, certification procedures, repayment limits and other matters necessary for the purposes of giving effect to the primary legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1567">Relief in respect of vehicle registration tax, VRT, and value added tax, VAT, may be obtained subject to the following maximum limits: €9,525 for a driver with a disability; and €15,875 for a passenger, family member or organisation, as referred to above.</p>
          <p eId="para_1568">Relief is available for a vehicle which has been specially constructed or adapted for use by a person with a disability and which has an engine size of less than 2,000 cc in the case of a driver and 4,000 cc in the case of a passenger or an organisation which represents persons with disabilities. The cost of the adaptation, in the case of a passenger, must amount to at least 10% of the cost of the vehicle exclusive of VRT.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569">The scheme also provides for repayment of excise duty on fuel used in a vehicle, for the transport of a person with a disability, up to a maximum of 600 gallons or 2,728 litres per year.

          <p eId="para_1573">The estimate for social insurance contribution income as set out in the 2004 abridged Estimates volume is based on existing PRSI rates, thresholds and exemption levels. The only change to the present situation is the normal technical assumption that the employee contribution ceiling will rise from its present level of €40,420 to €42,160, in line with the anticipated growth in non-agricultural earnings in 2004. The Department of Social and Family Affairs advise that the estimated 2004 yield from self-employed, employee and employer contributions will be €270 million, €1,090 million and €3,920 million, respectively. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of social insurance income between public and private sector contributors for 2004. Recruits to the public service since 6 April 1995 are insurable at the same classes of contributions as employees in the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1574">Other than the extension in relation to BIK as announced in budget 2003, no changes have been assumed in the health levy regime in the context of the 2004 AEV. Currently, the levy is charged at 2% on all income once the person's income exceeds €356 per week or €18,512 per annum. The estimated 2004 receipts of €891 million comprise employee and self employed contributions of €770 million and €121 million, respectively. The health levy involves no employer contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575">With regard to the national training fund levy, the 2004 estimate of €272.6 million assumes no change for the employer contribution regime. This levy is only paid by employers and is collected with the employer's PRSI contribution. No breakdown in respect of public and private sector employment is available.</p>

          <p eId="para_1577">The Revenue Commissioners have advised that the yield from stamp duty in 2002 on all house purchases by first-time buyers was approximately €29 million. This would have been the cost to the Exchequer in 2002 if the stamp duty liability for first-time buyers had been abolished. A current cost figure is not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1578">I am not in favour of giving a total exemption from stamp duty to first-time buyers for both Exchequer cost reasons and because there is no guarantee that the tax revenue thus foregone would accrue to the purchasers. However, I should point out that the purchases of new houses certified by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government as having a floor area of less than 125 metres square are exempt from stamp duty for all owner-occupiers including first-time buyers. Furthermore, first-time buyers can avail of a significantly reduced rate of stamp duty in a number of the price bands associated with the purchase of second-hand residential property compared with other owner-occupiers, and also compared to investors who pay stamp duty at the full rate on any residential property purchased, whether new or second hand.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_103">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the special savings incentive accounts, SSIAs. The Government tops up the savings deposited to these accounts each month by 25%. This top-up is equivalent to a tax credit at the standard rate of income tax in respect of the amount saved each month. If the SSIA runs its full course, then only the investment returns will be subject to tax and then only at a rate of 23%. The amount saved and the Exchequer contributions will then belong to the saver tax free. However, if a withdrawal is made from the account before the scheme expires, a 23% tax will apply on the full amount withdrawn.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_104">As with most other income, interest on savings is subject to tax. With effect from 6 April 1986, deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, has been deducted at source from interest paid or credited on accounts with the licensed banks, the Post Office Savings Bank and the building societies. All interest on deposits held by residents is subject to DIRT at 20% as final liability and this is regarded as satisfying an individual's full liability to tax in respect of that interest. Deposits held by non-residents are exempt from DIRT when an appropriate non-resident declaration is made.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">The Finance Act 2001 provided for the introduction of special term accounts. The tax treatment of these accounts differs according to the term of the investment. An exemption from DIRT and income tax will apply for the first €480 of interest received where the funds are invested for a minimum of three years and for the first €635 of interest received where the funds are invested for five years. Any interest received in excess of those amounts will be liable to DIRT at the standard rate. This DIRT is regarded as satisfying the individual's full liability to tax in respect of that interest.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">Under section 57 of the Finance Act 2001, an obligation to deduct DIRT at source was extended in certain circumstances to credit unions. With regard to regular share accounts in the credit union, members can choose to continue with the existing DIRT-free status but with consequential liability to income tax at his-her marginal tax rate if there is a tax liability. A special share account with a credit union has DIRT at 20% automatically deducted from dividend payments as final liability. Finally, a credit union member may hold shares in a special term share account which is a version of the special term accounts. An exemption from DIRT and income tax will apply for the first €480 of dividends received where the funds are invested for a minimum of three years and for the first €635 of dividends received where the funds are invested for five years. Any dividends received in excess of those amounts will be liable to DIRT at the standard rate. This DIRT is regarded as satisfying the individual's full liability to tax in respect of these dividends.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">Individuals aged 65 or over are entitled to a refund of DIRT paid depending on their level of income. In budget 2003, the exemption limit for the over 65s was increased to €15,000 for single or widowed persons and €30,000 for married persons. However, DIRT will not be repaid where levels of income are above these thresholds.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">A new regime for taxing investors on the return from investments in life policies and investment undertakings was introduced in the Finance Act 2000. The legislation provides that no tax is paid on the income and gains accruing to an investor within a life company or undertaking but that tax is withheld at the rate of 23% on the gains arising on the encashment of the policy or on the disposal of the fund by individuals who are resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland. This is regarded as satisfying an individual's full liability to tax in respect of that gain.</summary>

      <b>Mr. R. Bruton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Finance</b>
      the restrictions which apply to the claiming of relief for medical expenses of a taxpayer, of their immediate family, of a relative who has particular medical needs.

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1693">Over the last several years I considerably widened the scope of medical expenses relief and I removed a number of the restrictions that applied. For example, in the Finance Act 2001, I extended the relief to the cost of educational psychological assessments and speech and language therapy for children as well as routine maternity care. In the Finance Act 2001, I also simplified the relief by removing the requirement that the taxpayer must be in receipt of the dependent relative allowance, now a credit, to claim relief in respect of medical expenses of their dependent relative. In addition, in the Finance Act 2002, I extended the list of qualifying dependants beyond immediate family to include parents of the taxpayer, whether widowed or not, ancestors, lineal descendants, brothers and sisters, of the taxpayer mother or father of the taxpayer's spouse, brother or sister of the taxpayer's spouse, spouse of the taxpayer's son or daughter and other relatives or non relatives who are elderly, aged 65 or over, or permanently incapacitated.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_111">The main restrictions that currently apply to claiming tax relief for medical expenses are that it applies to amounts over €125 per annum, €250 per annum where the claim is in respect of more than one person, of qualifying expenditure incurred by the claimant; the cost of routine dental care, that is the cost of scaling, extraction and filling of teeth and the provision and repair of artificial teeth or dentures, is excluded; the cost of routine ophthalmic care, that is the cost of sight testing and advice as to the use of spectacles or contact lenses and the provision and maintenance of spectacles or contact lenses, is excluded.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_112">Tax relief is available for unreimbursed medical expenses therefore relief is not available for any expenses reimbursed from any public or local authority or under any contract of insurance or by means of compensation or otherwise.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_113">I would point out that the Revenue Commissioners have a detailed guide to the relief entitled "Health/Medical Expenses Relief" which is available on their websitewww.revenue.ieIf the Deputy has a specific issue in mind in relation to the above question and wishes to let me have the details, I can have the matter examined.</summary>

      <b>Mr. R. Bruton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Finance</b>
      the circumstances in which tax relief on additional voluntary contributions to a pension scheme is permitted to be made retrospectively.
      [27982/03]

        </question>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1695">The backdating of additional voluntary contributions only applies to the tax year immediately before the year in which the AVCs are paid, provided the payment is made before 31 October in the year in question. Contributions that cannot be relieved due to insufficiency of income in the prior year can be carried forward to later years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1696">In addition, the ability to spread back AVCs for up to ten years is available in the following circumstances: contributions deducted from lump-sums payable on retirement to provide for dependants' benefits; following resumption or change of employment, contributions on retirement to pay back previous refunds of contributions; following resumption or change of employment, contributions on retirement to pay back benefits already provided for under a scheme, for example marriage gratuity.</p>

          <p eId="para_1698">Schemes, such as the one the Deputy is referring to, are a relatively new type of financial product in Ireland. They are a means whereby an elderly person or couple can release part of the value of their home, while continuing to live in it. They also involve companies paying homeowners a cash lump sum in exchange for an interest in their house. The homeowner retains the right to live in the property rent-free until they die or move into a nursing home for six months. After this, the property is sold and the proceeds are divided between the property investment company and the homeowner or his estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1699">This type of scheme can be attractive to some elderly people who need to supplement their retirement income or who wish to improve their quality of life. There are, of course, alternative options such as moving to a smaller property or renting out a part of their home. However, they may not wish to avail of these options.</p>
          <p eId="para_1700">The type of scheme concerned differs from certain other schemes which are based on mortgage lending against the security of a property. Since in this case there is no loan or investment product involved, and since there is no financial institution involved, this type of activity is not currently regulated by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. While I have no plans to introduce legislation on this topic at this time I would not rule out the possibility, if this were felt to be necessary at some stage.</p>

While we welcome the measures taken by the Tunisian authorities to promote pluralism, democracy, and freedom of expression, of association, and of the press, serious restrictions remain on some individual human rights. Ireland along with its EU partners will continue to impress upon the Tunisian Government the importance of implementing all necessary reforms. At the most recent meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council on 29 September, the EU availed itself of the opportunity to make its concerns known to the Tunisian government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1717">My Department is aware of the case of Ms Radhia Nasraoui, a Tunisian human rights lawyer, and of the reports alleging harassment of Ms Nasraoui, her family and her clients, by the authorities. In February 2002, Ireland raised the case of Ms Nasraoui's husband, Mr. Hamma Hammami, at EU level. Mr. Hammami, a leading member of the banned Tunisian Communist Party had been arrested and imprisoned along with two other party members. In addition, the Presidency carried out a <i>démarche</i> to the Tunisian authorities, urging them to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms of Mr. Hammami, his family and his colleagues were respected following his release from detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1718">In view of the recent reports alleging harassment of Ms Nasraoui, her family and her clients, Ireland has raised the case with our EU partners with a view to considering appropriate follow-up action, including the possibility of carrying out a further démarche to the Tunisian authorities. As an initial step, we have sought a report from the EU heads of mission in Tunis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1719">Ireland has consistently lent practical support to the work of human rights defenders. We have always sought to raise awareness and appreciation of their endeavours and of the risks which they are forced to take. Accordingly, one of Ireland's objectives during our Presidency of the European Union will be to strengthen the existing support of the Union for the work of human rights defenders throughout the world.</p>

It was in recognition of this contribution that the Government agreed with the social partners, in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to establish the task force on policy regarding emigrants.

          <p eId="para_1723">Following receipt of the task force report, I established an interdepartmental working group to consider the task force's recommendations with a view to the submission of proposals for further action to the Government.

In summary, these include work to achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the sustained operation of all its institutions; pursuance of Ireland's foreign policy in accordance with the ideals enshrined in the Constitution and in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter; promotion and protection of Ireland's interest at the heart of the European Union as it enlarges and develops while ensuring an efficient and effective EU Presidency in 2004; promotion of Ireland's trade, investment, cultural and other interests, and ensuring that the State's network of diplomatic and consular missions adds value to these tasks; making a substantial and effective contribution to lasting poverty reduction and sustainable growth in developing countries through the policy and programmes of Development Co-operation Ireland; and protecting the interests of Irish citizens abroad, maintaining and strengthening links with people of Irish ancestry and providing a modern and efficient passport and consular service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">In pursuance of these objectives, the Estimates for Public Services for 2004, published last week, include a total provision of over €204 million for Vote 28 – Foreign Affairs and €399 million for Vote 29 – International Co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1733">The provision for Vote 28 includes an allocation to cover the costs of managing Ireland's EU Presidency in 2004, funding for the development of a new modernised passport production facility to meet the highest international standards for travel documents, and an increased provision for emigrant services abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1734">The allocation in 2004 of €399 million for Vote 29 represents the highest ever allocation to the Vote and an increase of €25 million over 2003. This will enable the Government to maintain official development assistance at 0.41% of GNP. Key priorities in 2004 will include assistance to programme countries – East Timor, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia; supporting the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic; provision of increased dedicated funding for NGOs; and funding for responses to emergency humanitarian crises. Development co-operation will also be a key focus of our 2004 EU Presidency.</p>

          <p eId="para_1743">Under the terms of the free fees initiative my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students. The main conditions are that students must be first-time undergraduates; and hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. I would point out that this residency requirement applies to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1744">I would emphasise the distinction between the criteria that determines eligibility under the free fees initiative and the criteria by which individual third level institutions establish the rates of tuition fees that should be charged in cases where a student does not qualify for free fees. The universities are autonomous bodies and, as such, may determine the level of fees to be charged in cases where the free fees initiative does not apply. The classification of a student as an EU or a non EU applicant is a matter for each institution to determine in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1745">Under section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000, educational establishments may not discriminate as regards the terms and conditions of admission on the basis that an applicant is of a different race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origin. However, educational establishments may exercise differential treatment as between EU and non EU nationals in relation to fees for admission and the allocation of places.</p>

          <p eId="para_1758">I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1759">It has been my Department's approach in recent years to increase the value of the grant under the student maintenance grant schemes annually at least in line with inflation. Similarly, as regards the reckonable income limits under the maintenance grant schemes, the practice in recent years has been to increase the limits at least in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. The Deputy, however, will be aware of my announcement on 25 May 2003 of a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year and for which provision is being made in the Department's Estimates for 2004 to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education. This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_119">The main provisions arising from the €42 million package are an increase of 15% in the maintenance grant to give a maximum grant of €2,885, which will benefit, it is estimated, approximately 56,000 students – this increase is substantially higher than the reference CPI increase of 5.1%; significant increases in the reckonable income limits and in the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education – the increases range from 9.5% to 16.3%, well above the reference increase of 7.6% in the average industrial wage; the introduction of a revised income limit scheme to include the following threshold levels – a new part maintenance or 75% and full fees and an upgrading of the full fees only income limit to become a part maintenance or 25% and full fees entitlement; the top income limit has been increased from €36,897 to €40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the student service charge.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_120">Significant improvements have been effected in the special rates of maintenance grant or top-up grants for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The higher, non-adjacent rate has been increased to €4,495, which is an amount equal to the maximum personal rate of social welfare unemployment assistance. The adjacent rate has been increased to €1,800. These increases represent top-ups on the ordinary grant of €1,610 and €645, respectively. The annual income threshold for the special rates of grant has been increased by 10.8% to €13,760.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_121">This substantial package of measures will provide the opportunity, in an unprecedented manner, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system. The publication of the Abridged Estimates is only the first stage in the process which provides an overall framework for decision-making in relation to services and programmes in the following year. I will convey the necessary details as decisions are taken.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1763">My Department's funding for third level access measures has increased from €508,000 in 1997 to €26 million in the current year. This underlines my commitment to access for disadvantaged students to further and higher education. Allocations are made in respect of the following measures. There are special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. As a result of changes implemented following a review in 2002, it was expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-03 would double to 7,000 students, but recent figures show that this target was exceeded with approximately 8,000 students receiving the top-up grant in 2002-03.</p>
          <p eId="para_1764">The millennium partnership fund for disadvantage provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. The brief of the partnerships is to engage in local development activities to promote social and economic inclusion. The provision for the fund in 2003 is €2 million and 59 area partnerships and community groups are receiving allocations. The student assistance fund provides financial support to disadvantaged students who require additional support to enable them to fully benefit from their third level studies. Provision for this fund increased from €7.49 million in respect of the 2001-02 academic year to €8.94 million in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1765">The fund for students with disabilities provides financial support to students with disabilities who require additional support to enable them to fully benefit from their third level studies. The number of students receiving assistance has increased significantly from 809 in the 2001-02 academic year to 1,058 in the 2002-03 academic year. Expenditure also increased significantly from €2.619 million in 2001-02 to €3.737 million in 2002-03. I anticipate that the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education, within the Higher Education Authority, will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</p>

The progress of these projects through that process will depend on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years. It is envisaged that when the projects in question are completed, there will be sufficient accommodation to meet the future needs at post-primary level in the Naas catchment area, including Kill.

          <p eId="para_1796">As part of the Good Friday Agreement, tourism was designated as an area for co-operation on an all-island basis. As a direct consequence, the inaugural meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in its tourism-sector format on 27 October 2000 agreed the establishment of a new all-island tourism marketing company, Tourism Ireland Limited, TIL, that is accountable to the North-South Ministerial Council. Its operations are financed on a North-South basis and it is responsible for the international marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourist destination. The company has its headquarters in Dublin and Coleraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1797">Fáilte Ireland also continues to work closely with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in the development of its marketing programmes in the product and niche area, all of which are agreed through the all-island tourism marketing partnership mechanism which comprises the two tourist boards, Tourism Ireland and the tourism industry North and South. There continues to be close co-operation between the Irish Sports Council and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland on many important sports issues and developments. An example of this co-operation is the all-Ireland sports development conference, which is taking place in Belfast today and tomorrow, 20 and 21 November 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1800">The priorities for my Department for the coming years are set out in the programme for Government and are further articulated in my Department's statement of strategy which is available on its website. These are clearly focused on the development of the three sectoral areas for which I have responsibility. The Estimates allocation of more than €430 million to my Department in 2004 represents an increase of 8% over the 2003 figure and will enable me to continue the development of those sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1801">For example, in the arts area, through a 19% increase in funding for the Arts Council to €52.5 million, I will be able to provide the council with the financial commitment to continue and develop its work. I have also been able to increase significantly the financial resources that will be available to the Irish Film Board. The successful organisation of the cultural programme associated with the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the organisation of the Irish Festival of Culture in China and the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Bloomsday will be particular priorities in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1802">With a significant increase in funding for the development of sport, I will be able to increase support to the Irish Sports Council to €30.75 million to continue and enhance its wide range of programmes aimed at increasing participation in sport at all levels. Increased funding for development of sports facilities to €62 million will allow me to increase funding to the local authority swimming pools programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1803">The Estimates in 2004 include an allocation of almost €114 million for tourism services. Here the emphasis will be on increased funding for marketing to enable major programmes to be rolled out in key target markets and increased funding for tourism services to support the tourism State agencies in beginning the process of implementing the recommendations of the tourism policy review group which sets out a new vision and strategy for Irish tourism for the ten year period to 2012.</p>

          <p eId="para_1816">The Abridged Estimates for 2004 were published last week by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. The abridged Estimates volume for 2004 shows an increase of €891 million in health spending to bring the total spend for 2004 to €10.05 billion, including capital, an increase of 10% on the revised Estimate for 2003. This represents an increase of 10.4% in day-to-day current spending on the revised Estimate for 2003. Given the overall increase in spending on public services, this additional €891 million underlines the Government's commitment to maintaining health spending into 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1817">Having secured an increase of 10%, which is almost double the overall Government increase in spending, my challenge is to manage this budget in the best interests of patient care. I will have the flexibility to prioritise selected areas within the overall funding available to me. In accordance with legislation, the letters of determination to the health boards must be sent out by my Department within three weeks of the publication of the abridged Estimates volume. The Deputy is aware that the Government's investment in the health service has increased by €6.55 million, or 187%, since 1997. This provides the system with a sound financial base within which priorities for service delivery can be managed. Given the overall need to manage Exchequer spending in 2004 within the constraints imposed by the economic climate, the challenge facing us is to continue to provide a quality health service throughout 2004. I will be working with health service management to achieve this goal.</p>

This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in society.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_126">It should be remembered that the chief executive officers of the health boards have discretion in the issuing of medical cards. A range of income sources are excluded by the boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance, are disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. In light of these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, the fact that one's income exceeds the guidelines does not mean one will not be eligible for a medical card. Such a card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances justify it.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1821">Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the chief executive officers of the health boards or the ERHA to assist in determining a person's eligibility for a medical card. The guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. It should be noted, however, that the guidelines are not statutorily binding.

It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide the services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. The Department of Finance has made a provision in the 2004 Estimates for non-pay inflation. This is included in my Department's Estimate of €10.05 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1823">Increases in charges for in-patient services and attendance at accident and emergency departments, from which medical card holders are exempt, will take effect from 1 January 2004. The public hospital statutory in-patient bed charge will be increased by €5 to €45 per night, subject to a maximum payment of €450 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge if the patient does not have a letter of referral from a general practitioner. This charge, which applies only to the first visit in any episode of care, will be increased by €5 to €45. In addition to the above statutory charges, the charge for private or semi-private accommodation in a public hospital will increase by 15% from 1 January next. The new charges are as follows:</p>

          <p eId="para_1841">As the Deputy may be aware, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme, prepared by Professor Eamon O'Shea, was launched in June 2003. The Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, was launched at the same time. It was agreed to review the scheme with a view to establishing its relevance and efficacy in providing for older peoples' needs. The objective of the Department's review is to develop a scheme which will be transparent, offer a high standard of care for clients, provide equity within the system to include standardised dependency and means testing, be less discretionary, be consistent in implementation throughout the country and draw on the experience of the operation of the existing scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1842">I will be guided by the recommendations of the review group when deciding to make any changes to the current scheme. The strategy adopted for the future of the scheme and proposed alternatives such as home-based subvention and personal care packages will be informed by the results of the review process. The inaugural meeting of the review group, which includes representatives of all stakeholders, will take place in early December. Pending the receipt of the recommendations of the review group, I do not propose to introduce any major revisions to the existing scheme.</p>

As a result, my Department has written to the chairman of the chief executive officers' group on a number of occasions, most recently on 5 November 2003. The Department asked the chairman to advise the chief executive officers of my concern that medical card holders should not be disadvantaged as a result of increases in social welfare payments which may be announced in the forthcoming budget. The chief executive officers were asked to ensure that increases in social welfare payments do not lead to medical card holders losing their medical cards by reference to the income guidelines. The chief executive officers were also asked to make every effort to ensure that medical card holders and applicants are made fully aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1876">Charges in respect of long-stay or extended care can be made under two sets of regulations. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person's income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1877">Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965 where the patient receives shelter and maintenance rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1878">In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</p>

          <p eId="para_1926">The NRA's current PPP programme comprises 11 projects spread throughout the country. It is estimated that user tolls on those projects will leverage private sector funding of approximately €1.15 billion for the national roads programme between 2004 and 2008.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_152">The amount of €150 million in external roads financing included in the public capital programme tables of the 2004 abridged Estimates volume is the estimated private sector investment in the N4-N6 Kilcock-Kinnegad scheme, which commenced construction earlier this year; the M1 Dundalk western bypass; the N8 Fermoy bypass and the N25 Waterford city bypass. It is additional to the 2004 Exchequer provision of €1.227 billion for the national roads improvement programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_153">Funding arrangements and toll revenue for the various schemes will not be determined until the relevant negotiations are finalised and tolling agreements entered into by the NRA. Total gross toll revenue over the next ten years, discounted to 2003 prices, from the projects where toll schemes have been adopted, Kilcock-Kinnegad PPP, Drogheda bypass and the West-Link bridge, is estimated at an average of under €70 million per annum.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_154">Regarding the costs of tolling to the motoring public, the road projects identified by the NRA for PPP based on user toll financing will deliver time savings, journey time certainty, and an overall high level of service to users for the toll charge levied. Those toll roads will be constructed as additions to the current network of national roads rather than provided by means of the improvement of existing roads. Road users will accordingly be in a position to choose whether to use the existing toll-free network for their journeys or the new tolled roads. I am confident, however, that the modest level of the tolls to be charged, combined with the high quality of the new roads and the greatly improved transport service they will provide, will ensure that the routes are attractive to the vast bulk of inter-urban traffic.</summary>

I expect all public transport projects under the NDP to be completed. Some projects will run beyond the plan's time limit.

          <p eId="para_1966">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of organised criminal groups is determined each year using the European Union definition of organised crime to compile the EU situation report on organised crime.

          <p eId="para_1967">The Garda have further informed me about the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau. While it is not the practice or policy to comment on particular operations carried out by CAB and other national units, a total of 26 orders were obtained by CAB under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 in 2002. They were as follows: interim orders under section 2(12); interlocutory orders under section 3(7); and receivership orders under section 7(7). Approximately half of the defendants in these cases were involved in drug trafficking.</p>

      if the public assertion of the Prison Officers Association, that it was never presented with the option of a ?10,300 increase in salary in return for working 360 extra hours a year, is correct.

          <p eId="para_1973">The assertion cited by the Deputy is inaccurate and misleading. The POA represents approximately 3,200 staff in all grades in the Prison Service up to, and including, Deputy Governor. Prison officers up to, and including, chief officer level, were offered an annual hours attendance system that would, if accepted, replace the current overtime system. The offer envisaged seven day liability staff in a number of grades represented by the POA contracting to work 360 hours a year, over and above the normal number of hours worked in the year based on a 39 hour working week. The payment offered was 1.8 times the relevant hourly basic rate of each officer for all 360 hours. Hourly rates vary considerably depending on an officer's grade, salary and point on the salary scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_1974">It is not strictly correct to say that prison officers were all offered a €10,300 per annum increase in salary in return for contracting to work 360 hours over the norm. Basic grade staff on full PRSI would be in a position to earn payments in respect of additional contracted hours ranging from approximately €8,000 at the minimum of the scale up to approximately €11,000 per annum at the upper end of the scale, provided they fulfilled their obligations under the scheme. The figure of €10,300 mentioned by the Deputy relates to approximate payments in respect of additional contracted hours for the majority of basic grade staff who are on the upper end of the reduced PRSI scale. The age and length of service profile of the organisation means that many of the currently serving staff in the basic prison officer grade are at or close to the top of their pay scales. The figure rises considerably when you take into account the hundreds of prison staff the POA also represents in supervisory grades.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_166">Under these proposals the total earnings, including allowances, of a basic grade prison officer at the minimum point of the scale is approximately €42,500 per annum. While a prison officer on the maximum long service increment point would earn approximately €58,000, excluding increases that may be applied under the benchmarking and Sustaining Progress programmes on 1 January 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_167">I have already made it clear the I cannot entertain the prison officers' claim for an increase in basic pay under the terms of the Sustaining Progress and benchmarking programmes. They were offered a guaranteed payment for the full 360 hours at a premium rate of 1.8, subject to the terms of the scheme to be agreed. It is clear that earnings under this approach are more predictable than those for overtime.</summary>

In order to achieve this objective I have secured substantial additional funding for the Garda Síochána amounting to an increase of €91 million. Included in this figure is an increase of almost €7 million for Garda overtime that will be used to fund specific anti-crime operations. I have also secured additional funding of almost €7.5 million in the Garda Vote to deal with security operations arising out of the Government's hosting of the EU Presidency in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_2026">The allocation for the Prisons Vote in 2004 is €345.6 million which is €8.3 million up on 2003 with the Prison Service getting €305.7 million and the Probation and Welfare Service getting €39.8 million. I want to eliminate the burden of excessive expenditure on overtime through the introduction of a system of annualised hours. If agreement cannot be reached with the Prison Officers' Association on annualised hours the Government has decided that specific cost saving measures will be introduced on a phased basis on 1 January 2004. I shall also increase the number of probation and welfare officers to address the demands placed on the service by the Children Act 2001. Under this Act community based options with supervision by such officers are available to the courts.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_170">My Department's allocation for 2004 is €327.9 million which is €2.4 million up on 2003. My priorities in this area include: child care –€68 million; asylum and immigration –€36 million; equality –€16 million; civil legal aid –€18 million; and the EU Presidency –€3 million. The range of initiatives and activities in this area is quite substantial and I will be happy to elaborate on specific areas of interest to the Deputy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_171">The 2004 courts' Vote is €75.2 million which is €2.6 million up on 2003. It will allow the Courts Service to continue its courthouse building and refurbishment programme. There is also some additional funding to deal with increased operational costs, including the services of stenographers and interpreters, where there has been significant pressure on budgets in recent years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">The Vote of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds has been increased to €32.65 million showing a slight increase of €0.5 million. The Land Registry will be able to continue its modernisation programme resulting in further improvements in the level of service to the taxpayer.</summary>

        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_653">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2039">I am aware of Focus Ireland's Right to a Home Campaign and I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government is continuing to work towards ensuring that housing needs, and in particular social housing needs, are adequately addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_2040">The Government's strategy on housing has one overarching aim, to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. The general strategy for realising the overall policy aim is that those who can afford to do so should provide housing for themselves, with the aid of the fiscal incentives available, and that those unable to do so from their own resources would have access to social housing or income support to rent private housing. Existing legislation and funding programmes support this strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2041">Consequently, the Government believes that it would be inappropriate to legislate for a specific right to housing, as suggested by the campaign, on the basis that the funding commitment to the various housing programmes is leading to increased outputs and that decisions on the allocation of financial resources is a matter for the democratically accountable Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_2042">Within the current legislative framework the Government have been able to place a strong focus on assisting homeless households in recent years. According to the assessment of housing need carried out by local authorities in March 2002, there were a total of 3,773 homeless households in the country at the time of assessment compared to 3,743 households in 1999. The vast majority of these were in homeless accommodation ranging from emergency to long-term supported housing rather than on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_2043">As part of the Government's homeless strategy, local authorities, together with health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, are required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness. These plans are now being implemented under the aegis of the local homeless fora and significant progress is being made in meeting the accommodation and care needs of homeless persons. A wide range of additional accommodation has been provided, ranging from emergency night shelter to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation more suited to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities as well as specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough as well as homeless offenders have been put in place. Further facilities will be provided as part of the full implementation of the homeless action plans.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_175">Substantial additional funding has been made available to support the implementation of the homeless strategies. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from €25.4 million to €50.8 million over the period 2001-05. Current funding for accommodation related homeless services by local authorities has increased substantially from €12.6 million in 2000 to €50 million this year. Funding continues to be made available to the voluntary sector for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons under the Department's capital assistance scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_176">With a view to ensuring that progress is sustained, the cross-departmental team on homelessness continues to monitor the implementation of the homeless strategies and a review of the strategies will be initiated by the end of 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_177">The Government is bringing about real and positive changes in the provision of social and affordable housing. We have responded actively to the increased level of housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output significantly. Last year saw the delivery of the highest level of output under the range of social and affordable housing measures for over 15 years, when the social and affordable housing needs of in excess of 12,700 households were met.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_178">On the provision of local authority housing the Government has been conscious of the increased level of social housing need. The last comprehensive assessment of housing needs carried out in March 2002 indicated that there were 48,413 households listed as being in need of long-term social housing. This level of need is of considerable concern to the Government. This year I expect that local authorities on their own will secure the completion of some 5,000 housing units and this is an indication of how local authorities have successfully accelerated their own programmes to meet existing demand more quickly. The Government also recognises the important role of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies and will continue to support them in their valuable work.</summary>

      asked the

      if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons who are homeless in the Dublin region are being housed in accommodation for which the rules (details supplied) are excessively restrictive and not family friendly; and his views on whether Exchequer funding should not be paid to the owners of hostels and bed and breakfasts who enforce such rules as those allowing for snap room inspections by management, and preventing visitors and enforcing non-association between guests.

          <p eId="para_2062">While my Department provides most of the financial resources for accommodation services for homeless persons, individual housing authorities are independently responsible for specifying the range and quality of such services at local level, having regard to local needs and circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_2063">In this context, it would be a matter for individual housing authorities to ensure that there are appropriate and adequate procedures in place so that both recipients and providers of homeless services are aware of their respective entitlements and duties. It would be generally accepted that homeless accommodation services should include practical arrangements designed to ensure the safety of all parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_2064">The use of bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin area is subject to an ongoing review by the city council and this has led to increased monitoring, improved co-ordination and better management practice within the Dublin area.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_664">
          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_2074">The Deputy will be aware from previous questions that my Department's priorities as set out in its strategy statement 2003-05 may be categorised under four headings: supporting community and local development by facilitating communities, with a special focus on areas of disadvantage, to pursue social and economic progress in their areas; tackling drug misuse by securing a more integrated and co-ordinated response by State agencies to tackling drug misuse; promoting rural, Gaeltacht and islands development by supporting living and working populations in these areas and fostering sustainable and culturally vibrant communities; and supporting the use of the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas and promoting the use of the language throughout the country. In this context I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the provision of €5.8 million in a new subhead for RAPID indicates the Government's continued commitment to the RAPID programme. As I indicated previously, I intend to separate the major issues that must be dealt with at departmental level from the smaller issues that can be dealt with more effectively at local level. Capital expenditure of €4.5 million is being provided in my Department's Vote in 2004 to support such projects. This funding will be used as leverage money to facilitate co-funding from other State agencies to take place and to support works in RAPID areas. I hope to make an announcement in the near future about the precise way that this money will be spent. In addition, €1.3 million is available to support the implementation of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2075">The money provided for community and voluntary services for 2004 is increased by 2%. I am happy that a full programme will be possible with the provision made available for 2004, by focusing the money on the areas of greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_2076">The provision for the implementation of the national drugs strategy and the young people's facilities and services fund has increased by 5% from €32 million to €33.5 million and in that context my Department intends to continue the implementation of the strategy including implementation of the plans of the local drugs task forces, overseeing the development of the regional drugs task forces and completing the research programme of the NACD.</p>
          <p eId="para_2077">The drugs strategy will be reviewed next year and that review will offer an opportunity to identify priorities for further action and to re-focus the strategy, if necessary. Also in 2004 during Ireland's Presidency of the EU my Department will particularly focus on the co-ordination of drugs issues on a community wide level.</p>
          <p eId="para_2078">The total funding for rural development is increased by 6% from €59.4 million to €63 million. During 2004 my Department will continue to ensure the effective management and implementation of the following rural development programmes: national rural development programme; farm relief services; Leader+; INTERREG – rural development measures; and PEACE II – rural development measures.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_180">The provision for the CLÁR programme has been increased by 13%, from €9.5 million to €10.7 million. This will enable the continuation of investment, under existing measures of the programme, in particularly disadvantaged rural areas and provide the scope for the introduction of such measures as may be identified during 2004 as necessary for the development of the targeted areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_181">The doubling of the provision for the western investment fund from €2 million to €4 million is an indication that Government is committed to western investment, and is anxious to assist the pioneering work being done by the Western Development Commission on venture capital in the west.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_182">A major priority for my Department in 2004 and coming years is the implementation on a phased basis of the Official Languages Act 2003. As the Deputy will be aware, the Act includes provision for establishment of the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga, for which a sum of €500,000 has been provided in the Estimates for 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_183">My priority, in so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, will be to continue to implement and develop measures aimed at supporting the maintenance and strengthening of the Irish language in Gaeltacht communities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_184">In order to give effect to these strategies and to the implementation, where appropriate, of recommendations contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta 2002, an additional €0.89 million, which represents an increase of 14% over 2003, has been set aside for cultural and social schemes in the Gaeltacht.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_185">A sum of €10 million has also been provided in the Estimates to facilitate the ongoing work of my Department on infrastructural improvement of the Gaeltacht. This funding will enable the continued implementation of measures aimed at improving the physical, social and economic conditions in Gaeltacht areas. Specific outputs will include the continued development and upgrading of roads and piers and recreational facilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">An increase of 17% for Údarás na Gaeltachta's current expenditure has been provided for in the 2004 Estimates. This increase is directed towards implementation of the relevant recommendations made by Coimisiún na Gaeltachta particularly in regard to crèches, nursery schools, co-operatives and community organisations, services for young people and other support services for the Irish language.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_187">An increase of 18%, from €8.5 million to €10 million, in the provision for expenditure on islands will be directed towards a major programme for the islands, including major pier improvement works at Inishturk and Clare Island, dredging works at Inishbofin, provision of an airstrip on Inishbofin and completion of work on Roonagh pier.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2082">Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet, including a gluten free diet, as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2083">Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</p>
          <p eId="para_2084">The present basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement payable in any individual case was put in place in 1996. In general, the amount of diet supplement payable is either €34.28 – lower cost diets – or €44.44 – higher cost diets – less one third of the applicant's income at 1996 rates. In the case of a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is €44.44 less one third of the applicant's income. In the case of children under the age of 18 there is a standard rate of €10.20 per week for a higher cost diet and €6.40 per week for a lower cost diet.</p>
          <p eId="para_2085">The assessment of means for diet supplement has not changed since 1996 to take into account increases in the real value of weekly social welfare payments or changes in the cost of special diets. Similarly, the rates of payment have not changed since 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_2086">Having regard to the increases in social welfare primary payment rates in the past number of years it has been decided that the payment of diet supplements will be phased out over a number of years as primary payment rates are increased.</p>

          <p eId="para_2088">The payment of the one-parent family payment is based on a person parenting alone without the support of a partner. The means-tested one parent family payment is intended to act as a safety net for separated or unmarried lone parents who have not obtained adequate, or any, maintenance for themselves and/or their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_2089">Couples who are physically separated for employment or other reasons may in fact maintain their matrimonial relationship and in such cases the marriage has not broken down. Evidence of breakdown in the marriage, for example, separation proceedings, is needed in order to determine whether one-parent family payment is payable.</p>
          <p eId="para_2090">This situation can also arise in the case of Irish nationals where the spouse remains resident in Ireland and the other spouse goes abroad to take up employment, while maintaining the matrimonial relationship. In such cases, the one parent family payment would not be payable to the spouse remaining in Ireland. Subject to certain conditions, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs, and the needs of any adult or child dependants, is entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_2091">I am satisfied that the statutory conditions for receipt of one-parent family payment in this regard are appropriate.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_2093">For the most part, the 2004 Estimates for social welfare spending, as in previous years, represent the cost of implementing unchanged priorities in the various programmes and services provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and its agencies. Normally, the Government sets out its priorities for social welfare spending in the coming year in the context of the budget and the Government's priorities in terms of its commitments will be made known at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_2094">The 2004 Estimates provide that total social welfare expenditure will rise to a record €10.65 billion in 2004, representing over 30% of total Government spending. Compared to 1997, total social welfare expenditure will have almost doubled. This has enabled substantial improvements to be made, not alone in the rates of social welfare payments, but also in the conditions for entitlement to these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2095">Approximately 970,000 people on average will be in receipt of a weekly social welfare payment next year, while almost 1.5 million people, including dependants, will benefit from these payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2096">The level of resources being allocated to social protection measures clearly illustrates the Government's continuing commitment to protecting the position of the people who are less well off in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_2097">Some of the main areas of increased social welfare expenditure provided for in the 2004 Estimates include child benefit which will be increased by €70 million, old age contributory pension which will increase by €51 million, disability allowance which will increase by €40 million and supplementary welfare allowance which will increase by €72 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2098">However, to counter the emergence of some spending pressures on the social welfare side and to ensure that spending stays within agreed Government guidelines, a number of measures were identified and announced with the Estimates. These spending pressures emphasise the need for my Department to ensure careful management of the social welfare budget to ensure that the resources are focused at those most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_2099">The priority in identifying these measures was to protect the most disadvantaged. Accordingly, measures have been identified so as to limit spending on new claimants where there is an alternative source of income; to target the effectiveness of a labour market intervention as in the case of back to education allowance; or to address anomalies in the social welfare system such as by adjusting the level of graduated payments to reflect increases in rates over the past ten years. For the most part, these measures will not affect existing claimants, but will apply to new claimants from various dates in 2004.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_2101">The Abridged Estimates volume for 2004 reflect eight policy measures, which I have outlined below, in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_2102">The main supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme will continue to apply in 2004, subject to these measures. A total of more than €637 million is provided in the estimates for SWA in 2004, an increase of more than €72 million or 11% on the 2003 provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_2103">The main supports under the supplementary allowance scheme are basic supplementary welfare allowance, rent supplements, mortgage interest supplement, diet or heating supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_2104">The first measure relates to the contribution to rent to be made by recipients of rent supplement from their own resources. The rate of the minimum contribution is to be increased from €12 to €13 per week. This will maintain the rate of the minimum contribution at approximately 10% of the basic personal rate of supplementary welfare allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_2105">The second measure relates to people in full-time employment. With the exception of those participating in approved employment schemes people engaged in full-time employment are excluded from receiving supplementary welfare allowance. This has been a feature of the scheme since it was established in 1977.</p>
          <p eId="para_2106">Explicit provision will be made to exclude the spouse or partner of a person in full-time employment from receipt of supplementary welfare allowance. This measure will give effect to the original intention that supplementary welfare allowance should not be paid in households with full-time open market employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2107">The third measure relates to people wishing to become tenants with the support of rent supplement. In general, with provisions for exceptions for the homeless, people who are at risk of becoming homeless and other vulnerable people, such as the elderly and people with disabilities, rent supplement will no longer be payable in cases where the applicant has not been residing in rented accommodation for a period of a least six months. The purpose of SWA rent supplement, like other social welfare programmes, is to meet income maintenance needs where people are unable to meet their accommodation costs. Meeting the housing needs more generally is a matter for the housing authorities through various social housing programmes and otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_2108">The fourth measure relates to ensuring that people on rent supplement are assessed for housing by the local authority. Currently a health board may, at its discretion, refer an applicant for rent supplement to the local authority for an assessment of his or her housing needs. In future, applicants for rent supplement will be referred to the local authority on a more systematic basis for an assessment of his or her housing needs. My intention is that, ultimately, local authorities will determine in all cases whether the "in need of accommodation" condition is met.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_188">This measure will provide the local authority with a more accurate picture regarding the long-term housing needs of those living in its functional area. The rent supplement scheme will continue to provide support where the local authorities are not in a position to respond to those needs within a reasonable timeframe and where the person is at risk of experiencing hardship.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_189">The fifth measure relates to local authority accommodation for people on rent supplement. At present, it is possible for an individual to refuse more than one offer of local authority accommodation and still have the option of being assessed for rent supplement. In future, a rent supplement will no longer be paid to people who refuse offers of local authority accommodation or to people who leave local authority accommodation without reasonable cause. Up to now, it has been possible for people to refuse local authority housing in favour of availing of State support from the health board in respect of those same housing needs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_190">The sixth measure relates to crèche supplements. Crèche supplements were introduced to provide assistance in respect of a child who was placed in a crèche for short periods to help develop the social interaction skills of the child or to assist mothers who would not otherwise be able to avail of particular supports that they needed – such as counselling services. Payments of crèche supplement are being made in increasing numbers to people who are clearly outside the scope of what was originally intended.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_191">In the light of Government spending on the development of child care facilities under the national development plan and the substantial increases provided in child benefit, in part to assist in meeting child care costs, it has been decided to discontinue the crèche supplement. A family in crisis who need access to a crèche can still be supported under the exceptional needs payment provision of the scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_192">The seventh measure relates to supplements paid to people with debt problems. A supplement is currently payable in some cases to people who have been supported by the money advice and budgeting services in brokering a deal with creditors. Payment of this supplement is to be discontinued as it has effectively become a subsidy for creditors such as banks and lending institutions. The normal support service of the money advice and budgeting service will not be affected by this measure.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_193">The eighth measure relates to diet supplements. Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The assessment of means for diet supplement has not changed since 1996 to take into account increases in the real value of weekly social welfare payments or changes in the cost of special diets. Similarly, the rates of payment have not changed since 1996.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_194">Having regard to the increases in social welfare primary payment rates in the past number of years it has been decided that the payment of diet supplements will be phased out over a number of years as primary payment rates are increased.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_195">The measures I have outlined are needed to ensure that supplementary welfare allowance is paid in appropriate circumstances, in accordance with established policy and taking into account the objectives of the scheme, which is to focus on meeting immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. In addition the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for exceptional or urgent needs payments which may be paid where in the opinion of the health board exceptional circumstances exist.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2110">The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</p>
          <p eId="para_2111">At present, to qualify for participation an applicant must be, <i>inter alia,</i> in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months – 156 days. The qualifying period will be increased from six months – 156 days – to 15 months – 390 days – for new applicants intending to commence third level courses of study, with effect from September 2004. The qualifying condition will remain at six months – 156 days – for people who wish to pursue a second level qualification. Time spent pursuing a second level course with the assistance of the back to education scheme will count towards meeting the 15-months qualification condition for the third level option.</p>
          <p eId="para_2112">I have decided to restructure the back to education allowance in this way to ensure that this support retains its focus on the more vulnerable groups in our community, particularly people who do not have a second level education qualification and who are at risk of becoming dependent on social welfare payments on a long-term basis. I want to ensure that available resources are aimed at those in greatest need of an intervention to prevent them from drifting into long-term unemployment. This change recognises the more urgent need for intervention in the case of people who have not completed formal second level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_2113">It is vital that my Department's employment support services retain their relevance to current employment and economic conditions and continue to focus on the most vulnerable groups.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_196">The back to work allowance scheme was reviewed last year in the light of economic and labour market changes and, in particular, of the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the allowance in 1993. Following that review, I introduced certain changes to the scheme earlier this year. I will continue to monitor the scheme but I have no immediate plans to change the existing qualifying criteria.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2116">I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 236 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2117">The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly and incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_2118">Provision has been made in successive budgets for substantial increases in the means disregards for this scheme. In April 2003, the weekly income disregards increased to €210 for a single carer and to €420 for a couple. The effect of this increase is that a couple with two children, earning a joint income of up to €24,150, can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple, if they had an income of €39,750, could still qualify for partial carer's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_2119">On other benefits available to carers, the carer's benefit scheme was introduced in October 2000. This scheme provides financial support based on a person's PRSI contributions. It is not means-tested. Carer's leave, which was introduced in July 2001, allows carers to avail of a job-protected leave of absence for a period of up to 15 months. Carer's allowance recipients who are caring for more than one incapacitated person are entitled to an additional 50% of their rate of payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2120">An annual respite grant was introduced in 1999. It is payable to recipients of carer's allowance and carer's benefit. The grant is a contribution towards respite care to be used as the recipients wish. The grant increased to €735 in 2003 and carers caring for more than one person receive a double respite care grant of €1,470.</p>
          <p eId="para_2121">Carer's allowance recipients also qualify for the free schemes. This is a major additional benefit covering free travel and the household benefits package. The back to work allowance, back to education allowance and community employment schemes are available to carers when they cease caring. The question of any further change in provision for carers would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</p>

      the ceilings on supplementary welfare allowances for rent or mortgage interest for different family units which apply in the different health boards; if she has made provision in her Estimates to allow these limits to be increased in 2004; and if so the increase which has been provided for.

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_2123">Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2124">One of the conditions for receipt of rent supplement relates to the amount of rent a person may incur. Each health board sets a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur, taking the household size and other relevant circumstances into account. This is to ensure that the rent is reasonable and that the health board is not subsidising the cost of overly large or overly expensive accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2125">As the Deputy will be aware, I introduced regulations in 2002 which provided for holding the maximum rent levels until the end of December 2003 at the values set by the health boards at that time. I will arrange for a copy of this regulation which outlines the individual limits that currently apply in each health board to be forwarded to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2126">The legislation governing the payment of rent supplements continues to provide the health boards with discretion to deal with exceptional cases. To date my Department has been notified of some 900 instances where the health board availed of this discretion in dealing with cases involving rents which exceed the prescribed limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_2127">The issue of the maximum rent levels that will apply in 2004 is still under consideration. A decision will be taken in the near future following consideration of the exceptional cases as notified by the health boards, updated information from the Central Statistics Office on rent levels in the private rented sector and submissions which have been received from the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_2128">More than €637 million has been provided in the 2004 Estimates for total expenditure on SWA, including rent supplements. This is more than 11% higher than the current year's budget to cater for increased numbers of recipients and other factors that affect total expenditure. No specific provision was made in the Estimates for any increase in the existing maximum rent levels.</p>

          <p eId="para_2130">In assessing means for social assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. For the purposes of assessing the value of capital and property a notional assessment method is used. The use of the notional method avoids the necessity of frequent reviews of the entitlements of a significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuate or whenever the capital is moved from one investment option into another.</p>
          <p eId="para_2131">The Social Welfare Act 2000 provided for the introduction of a new assessment method for capital and property for social assistance schemes including old age non-contributory pension. Under these arrangements, the first €12,697.38 of capital is disregarded and the assessment is on a sliding scale for amounts above this. At present a single pensioner with capital of up to €20,315.80 qualifies for a full pension while a single pensioner with capital of up to €66,026.37 qualifies for a minimum pension. These amounts are doubled for pensioner couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_2132">On the assessment of means from the sale of a residence, there are provisions to enable a person aged 66 or over who is in receipt of a means-tested payment from the Department to sell his/her principal residence and either buy or rent alternative accommodation or move into a private nursing home. Under these provisions, the balance of the gross proceeds from the sale of the principal residence is exempted from the means test, subject to a ceiling of €190,461. These provisions were extended in recent years to include pensioners who sell their principal residence to move in with a person who is receiving carer's allowance or benefit for providing full-time care for them and also to those who move into sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative, statutory or private sectors following the sale of their principal residence.</p>
          <p eId="para_2133">Any changes to the current method of assessment of capital and property would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

          <p eId="para_2135">Family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide income support for employees with families on low earnings and thereby protect the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if s/he were claiming other social welfare payments.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_198">Secondary benefits is the term that applies to a number of benefits which are administered by State bodies, including the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It includes the retention of medical cards and the payment of rent and mortgage supplements. The potential disincentive effects of the loss of secondary benefits for those who move from unemployment or other social welfare payment back into employment has been addressed in the past and a range of measures introduced, including the retention of some secondary benefits in full or on a sliding scale for a number of years following the commencement of employment or the take up of an approved employment support scheme or training course. Although FIS may also be payable in some cases where secondary benefits are payable, it is not itself a qualifying payment for retention of secondary benefits.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2137">Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, after they have paid for the accommodation.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_199">One of the conditions for receipt of rent supplement is that a person must have a genuine accommodation need and be unable to provide for it from his or her own resources. This can arise, for example, when a person in rented accommodation becomes unemployed or is no longer able to work because of illness and therefore is unable to meet his or her accommodation costs. The purpose of rent supplement is to help with a person's immediate income maintenance needs in their type of situation. Rent supplement is a priority intended as a short-term support in these situations. Meeting housing needs more generally is a matter for the housing authorities through the various social housing programmes and otherwise. At present a health board may, at its discretion, refer an applicant for rent supplement to the local authority for an assessment of his or her housing need.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">The Abridged Estimates volume for 2004 reflects a number of policy measures in the rent supplement scheme. One of the measures is that applicants for rent supplement will be referred to the local authority for an assessment of their housing needs on a more systematic basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_201">This measure will provide the local authority with a more accurate picture regarding the long-term housing needs of those living in its functional area. The rent supplement scheme will continue to provide support where the local authorities are not in a position to respond to those needs within a reasonable timeframe and where the person is at risk of experiencing hardship. This is in accordance with the underlying purpose of the rent supplement scheme.</summary>
