          <p eId="para_46">For the information of Deputies, amendment No. 47 is No. 14 in the explanatory memorandum.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">This amendment provides for the replacement of the current section 13 of the Act of 1996. It incorporates the amendments to that section already contained in the Bill. I will describe what I regard as the key feature of this new section. The mechanism provides for cases which are refused a recommendation by the commissioner in the first instance and where, in addition, the commissioner's recommendation contains one or more of the findings at subsection (6) of the new section.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">The subsection lists the characteristics which, in the Government's view, warrants a case being dealt with in an accelerated fashion on appeal. The features of that accelerated process are threefold. The applicant has ten working days within which to appeal, rather than the standard period of 15 days. The appeal is on the papers only, with no oral hearing and the appeal is to be dealt with as a matter of priority. Another important feature is the possibility of providing for selected classes of cases, particularly a fast, accelerated process, whereby the commissioner's recommendation is negative and the application has one of the characteristics listed in subsection (6). In those cases, the appeal period is to be four working days.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Subsection (1) is substantially the same as the subsection as it now stands in the 1996 Act, but is modified in tandem with the new section 11(2), which we discussed earlier on amendment No. 32, by simplifying the paper trail associated with the investigation of the application by confining the scope of reports under section 11(2) to a report of the interview itself. As I indicated on that amendment, a small chunk of the investigative process is being moved from section 11(2) to this new subsection. Thus, the report to be prepared under this new subsection (1) will contain the material regarding the other aspects of the investigation of the application that has heretofore been done under section 11(1). This will permit greater flexibility for the commissioner's deployment of resources than at present, but will otherwise not affect the investigation process. The substance of the two subsections taken together is unchanged.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Subsection (2) replaces the new subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), as it stands, which is in section 16(1) of the Bill. The purpose of the new subsection is to provide that the withdrawal or deemed withdrawal of an application under sections 9 or 11 will result in a negative and unappealable recommendation. I have already strongly voiced the Government’s stance on the position of asylum seekers in regard to the State whose protection they seek. As was recently and aptly described by a Muslim imam at a public talk on another matter within my remit, there exists a form of contract between the State and the asylum seeker. The State undertakes to examine the claim for protection and fair procedure with the necessary interpreter and legal advice facilities and, while the claim is being examined, the State undertakes to permit the applicant to remain in the State and house, feed and clothe him or her. For the other part, the asylum seeker is expected to co-operate in the investigative process. That involves, in broader terms, remaining in contact with the investigators by ensuring that the commissioner is kept informed of the applicant’s address in the State, making himself or herself available for interview and providing whatever information is possible to assist in the investigation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">An applicant who does not keep his or her end of the bargain cannot ask us to be allowed to go about this country indefinitely. If an applicant fails to co-operate in the process, having been given fair opportunity to do so, the application will be deemed withdrawn. The State will conclude that someone who acts in that fashion has, by that action or inaction, withdrawn his or her claim and will treat the application accordingly. Thus, there will be no appeal and the Minister will make a negative declaration. If such a person wants to make a fresh application, it is open to him or her to seek the Minister's consent under section 17(7) of the Refugee Act to make that application.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Deputy Finian McGrath's amendment No. 48 seeks to delete the words from the current provisions of the Bill relating to withdrawing applications, which would have the effect that applicants would have the right to appeal when, by their failure to co-operate in the asylum process, they had demonstrated that their applications were withdrawn. In effect, the amendment proposes that applicants should be allowed to say that they wish to appeal against their own decision, which is clearly an untenable proposition. I need hardly say that I neither accept the amendment nor the principle that lies behind it. Subsection (3) reproduces the current subsection (2) of the 1996 Act, with the modification that information will be supplied to the UNHCR, only if that body requests it. The purpose of this modification, made at UNHCR's own request is to preserve the right of the UNHCR to preserve whatever information it requires about individual cases in the asylum process, while at the same time ensuring that it is not overloaded with volumes of information that it cannot handle.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Subsection (4) retains certain of the substance of 13(3) of the Refugee Act, but with some important changes reflecting the accelerated procedure in subsections (5) and (8) of the new section. In paragraph (<i>b</i>), where the report of the commissioner includes a recommendation that the person is not to be declared a refugee, no appeal shall lie where the application is withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn. This makes sense as the person is not around to pursue the appeal or has made claim that he or she is no longer interested in pursuing the application. In all other cases of a negative recommendation, the entitlement to appeal is subject to subsection (5) and (8), where the recommendation is a finding of the type set out in subsection (6). In such cases the period in which to appeal will be ten or, in certain circumstances, four working days rather than the norm of 15 working days and the appeal will be dealt with on the papers alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">Paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of subsection (4) reproduce without modification the corresponding paragraphs of the current section 13. Paragraph (e) of subsection (4) reproduces the content of the amendment at section 6(<i>d</i>)(ii)(II) of the Bill as it stands, superseded by this new section. This will ensure that the Minister is notified immediately of a negative recommendation of the commissioner arising from a withdrawal or deemed withdrawal. The question of waiting for a period before doing so does not arise since no appeal is to lie in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Subsection (5) is in effect the replacement for the "manifestly unfounded" process set out in section 12 of the Refugee Act 1996. Where the commissioner makes a negative recommendation and the report which includes that recommendation also includes a finding of the type set out in subsection (6), the time for making an appeal is to be shorter and the appeal will be determined without an oral hearing, both aspects the same as applies in the case of an application deemed manifestly unfounded under section 12 of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Subsection (6) sets out the characteristics which warrant an application on which a negative recommendation has been made being dealt with on the papers only at appeal and a shorter time period within which to make an appeal. In effect, they replace section 12(4) of the Act as it stands. The findings set out at the new section 13(6) of the 1996 Act proposed in Government amendment No. 47 are broadly comparable with, though not necessarily equivalent to, certain of the "manifestly unfounded" criteria at the current section 12(4). They cannot be treated as equivalents because these findings would apply only after the negative recommendation has been made following investigation of the claim to establish whether the applicant is a refugee, and do not necessarily go to the core of the negative recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">The broad correlations or comparisons, which are set out in the explanatory memorandum prepared by the Department, are as follows: paragraph (<i>a</i>), a finding of “no basis or minimal basis” for the claim, is broadly comparable to the present section 12(4)(<i>a</i>); paragraph (<i>b</i>), where there was false, contradictory, misleading or incomplete information, is broadly comparable with the present section 12(4), paragraphs (<i>b</i>) to (<i>f</i>) and (<i>k</i>); paragraph (<i>c</i>), where the application was not made as soon as reasonably practical after arrival, can be compared with the present section 12(4)(<i>h</i>); paragraph (<i>d</i>), which deals with a prior application’s having been made elsewhere, is broadly comparable with the present section 12(4)(<i>g</i>), (<i>i</i>) and (<i>l</i>); and paragraph (<i>e</i>), safe country of origin, is loosely comparable to the present section 12(4)(<i>j</i>).</p>
          <p eId="para_58">The question of whether a finding listed in this subsection is to be included in the report only arises in cases in which, at the conclusion of the investigation, the commissioner's recommendation is negative. Thus, for instance, the fact that an applicant did not apply as soon as reasonably practical after arriving in the State and had no reasonable cause for applying late would not be relevant if the commissioner's investigation of the claim led to a positive recommendation that the applicant was a refugee and would not affect that positive recommendation. Findings of the type listed in the subsection are a basis for accelerating the hearing of the appeal where a negative recommendation has been made by the commissioner but are not necessarily a basis for the negative recommendation itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Subsection (7) enables the Minister to specify classes of applications to be dealt with at first instance by the commissioner under the new powers provided for in the new subsections (8) and (9). What we have in mind here is that for a category of cases specified in a direction under this subsection, there will be in place a team of the staff of the refugee applications commissioner dedicated to dealing with applications coming within that category within a matter of days of the application being made. Selecting the category by reference to, say, a safe country of origin or a small number of safe countries of origin will mean that the commissioner's interviewing and decision-making staff can be steeped in the background information on the selected countries of origin and with the economies of scale that that brings, they will be able to address the protection issues of the applicants in the selected category quickly and directly. For example, if Canada, New Zealand and Australia were banded together for this purpose, a selected team in the RAC's office would have full knowledge of all matters to do with Canada and this would enable the process to be speeded up because there would be no need to do research on a case by case basis. Other practical features of such a system would be the ready availability of legal advice to applicants, and where necessary the ready availability of interpreters to service the needs of both the legal consultations and the interviews under the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Applicants in this stream will be notified early in the investigation, under subsection (8) of the new section, that if the investigation results in a negative recommendation and the negative recommendation includes a finding of the type listed in subsection (6), they will have four working days within which to appeal, as against ten working days for other recommendations with such findings, and that any appeal will be dealt with as a matter of priority and without an oral hearing. For this system to operate fairly and with a fast turnaround time, it is likely that the applicants selected for this high priority process would be accommodated in specific locations within the direct provision system and required under section 9(5) of the Act to reside there and report at regular intervals to an immigration officer at that location. This arrangement would facilitate the hand-delivery of letters and notices to applicants and their legal advisers and thus help to ensure expeditious processing of the applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">In some other countries applicants such as these would be accommodated in a detention centre so that effectively certain categories of applicant would remain in custody. We have not gone down that road, all we have said is that we will require the applicant to be reasonably near at hand while the accelerated process is taking place. There is the possibility of a Report Stage amendment to section 9(5) of the Refugee Act for inclusion in this Bill to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to permit that provision to operate well in practice while ensuring certainty among applicants as to what is required of them under that provision. As a safeguard for applicants, subsection (9) provides that this shorter appeal period cannot apply unless the applicant has been notified in advance of the investigation that the application is to be dealt with in this way. Nobody will wake up one morning to find they have been fast-tracked without having been told.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">Subsections (10) and (11) reproduce the substance of subsections (6) and (7) of section 11, which Government amendment No. 32, subparagraph (iv), proposes to delete from that section. The effect of these two changes, taken together, will be to oblige the commissioner to supply the applicant with copies of documents and so on submitted in the course of the investigation in any case where there is a negative decision that is appealable. At the moment this information must be supplied in every case irrespective of the outcome. I believe that overall this is a fair and balanced approach to the types of rejected cases envisaged in subsection (6), namely, flimsy claims - those where the applicant lied or suppressed the truth in a gross fashion; failed claims made to prolong or postpone deportation; failed claims where the applicant has already had a shot elsewhere at the asylum process; and failed claims made by people who live in safe countries. As with all other cases, every such case will be examined on its merits at first instance and if the examination shows that the applicant is not a refugee in these special instances we will demonstrate, by disposing of the appeal in an accelerated manner, that we are serious about not letting our asylum process be abused. I urge Deputies to support the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Amendment No. 50 is linked to amendment No. 47. It provides an amendment to section 16(1) and (2) of the Refugee Act 1996. The new subsection (1) incorporates changes consequential on the adjusted reporting arrangements under new sections 11 and 13 designed to simplify the reporting paper trail and on the withdrawal provisions whereby the negative recommendation in such cases under section 13(2) will not be appealable. The new subsection (2) reflects the fact that the question of the appeals tribunal remitting manifestly unfounded cases under the existing section 12 will no longer arise due to the new sections 12 and 13 of the Act inserted in amendment No. 47 and the earlier amendment No. 46. As I said when we discussed amendment No. 46, the operation of section 12 of the Act, the "manifestly unfounded" procedure, and remission of those cases, has proven difficult at times in practice because it has led to duplication of work and a prolonging of the asylum process rather than, as was its aim, a shortening of it for cases considered lacking in merit or good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">In the proposed amendment the application will move forward with the tribunal deciding to affirm a recommendation of the commissioner or setting aside that recommendation and deciding that the person is a refugee. We are getting rid of the notion that a manifestly unfounded matter, when it is appealed, goes back to first principles and we are substituting for it a system whereby every appeal will be decided on its merits in its entirety.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_65">That is certainly a mouthful dealing with a huge number of sections, amendments and amendments to amendments. I was pleased to hear the Minister is considering an amendment on Report Stage to let people know that they are being fast-tracked. It will be a tremendous relief to them to know they are on the fast train out of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">We have gone through a lot of this material before but, in many ways, this section is at the heart of the refugee process. It covers what was envisaged by the Geneva Convention and how we go about it. There should be a set of procedures, everyone should get an individual interview and a decision should be made on that basis. People should not be categorised, there should be no fast-track, manifestly unfounded scenarios should not be put in place, there should not be designated safe places to which people could be sent and people who might be found to be in breach of the Geneva Convention should still get a hearing. The Minister is proposing to do away with all that in this fast-track procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">The UNHCR appreciates the need to tackle the problem of applicants who fail to comply with required procedures but it does not propose that it should be done the way the Minister does it. In page 7 of its documentation it says that such applicants should not be deemed to be rejected, as the Bill envisages. The UNHCR's position is that a person can be found to be or not to be a refugee only after a substantive interview has been conducted in light of the refugee definition. Therefore, rejecting an applicant who has not been interviewed is not in keeping with the object and purposes of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol. The UNHCR recommends that such applications be considered abandoned and closed. This is a technical matter which has no impact on efforts to remove withdrawn cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The Minister is proposing accelerated procedures that will create a situation where someone who does not comply with those procedures will be deemed to have his application withdrawn. It is as if he withdrew it himself, a horse of a different colour, and he will be dealt with in the pre-emptory fashion the Minister has proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The UNHCR is saying that such cases should not be deemed to be withdrawn, they should be abandoned because there could be a valid reason people did not meet the 15 day deadline for a letter sent or the three and four working day deadlines and are, as a result, deemed not to be refugees. They are then fast-tracked out of the system on the bullet train. They cannot appeal and effectively find themselves outside the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">This section deals with the proposal to fast-track these people and it does not accede to the spirit or letter of the Geneva Convention in dealing with people. The Minister is cutting short the procedures that are part and parcel of that convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Will the Minister comment on amendment No. 50 to section 6, which states that the role of the tribunal is to affirm a recommendation of the commissioner or to set it aside? A limited role has been given to the appeals tribunal in relation to any decision that is taken by the commissioner in this matter. The Bill does not envisage a full appeal hearing in any cases that the commissioner has deemed to be manifestly unfounded. Those involved who are in the fast-track process will be sent to the designated safe countries, deported or dealt with in a manner different from that which all asylum seekers are expected to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The new provisions run counter to the requirements of the Geneva Convention and the UNHCR has many reservations about what the Minister is doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">That passage in the UN commentary looks more disputatious than it is. The UNCHR is saying that instead of what we are putting in our Bill, we should categorise those cases as abandoned and closed. This is about terminology.

It is not an absolute discretion that I can simply say no and not tell someone why I said that. I have no doubt that if I tried that, the person asked me to explain why and I refused, I would be dragged to the courts and made to explain myself. I have no doubt, equally, that the courts would slap me on the wrist and quash my decision if it was made unreasonably.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">It is not as if I regard myself as a gatekeeper who can on personal whim or from underlying malice say no to people. If someone reapplies for refugee status I have to take it as a serious application and I must have a reason for not consenting to the renewed application. I stress that the notion of rejection in these circumstances will be included in the EU directive in relation to asylum seeking, which is coming down the tracks at us. In large measure, we are talking about terminology here, and the UN is saying it prefers its terms to our terms. The UN is entitled to its view, and I will just have to agree to disagree with it. What I am doing is in line with what the European Union is proposing to make it obligatory for me to do when the new directive comes into operation either this year or in early 2004.</p>

If any of them is missed, it is not a case of three strikes and one is out. One can be out right down along the line if one misses out on the deadlines that are now specified.

          <p eId="para_92">No, there is nothing unusual except that there may be minor and technical reasons as to why somebody does not meet one of the deadlines. The deadlines are now very constricted. If one is not able to reply within a certain period of time - the various timescales outlined have diminished and contracted enormously - one is deemed to be out of the loop and deemed to be rejected. It is such a substantial decision that enables individuals to be fast-tracked, and once they are on the fast track train there is no way off it. One is out of the system straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">The problem is the inability to come back into the system anywhere along the line without going to the Minister, especially when the Geneva Convention indicates that there should be greater flexibility at that level.

          <p eId="para_130">The new subsection (2) reflects the fact that the question of the Refugees Appeals Tribunal remitting manifestly unfounded cases under the existing section 12 will no longer arise when the new sections 12 and 13 are in operation. As I said when we discussed amendment No. 46, the operation of section 12 of the Act has proven difficult at times in practice. It led to duplication of work and a prolonging of the asylum process, rather than, as was its original aim, shortening it for cases that were considered to be lacking in merit or good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Cases were dealt with as manifestly unfounded. They were appealed at first instance and on some technicality they went back again to first instance, instead of having the matter dealt with substantively on the appeal. There were several cases in which they would be allowed and it had to go back to first instance. We decided to replace that with a new system in which the appeal will always be a substantive one rather than one purely on the technical issue as to whether it was manifestly unfounded. It will be an appeal on the merits always, even if in certain cases it will be on the documents only.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">(iv) the deletion in subsection (5) of 'or 12',".</p>
          <p eId="para_144">This amendment refers to No. 16 in the explanatory memorandum. The amendment is to section 6(<i>e</i>)(iii) of the Bill, which modifies the appeal provisions in section 16(3) of the Refugee Act 1996 consequent on the provisions in the new section 13 of the Act to reflect the appeal period provided for in subsection (4)(<i>b</i>), which is 15 days, and subsection (5)(<i>a</i>), which is ten days, and in subsection (8)(<i>a</i>), which is four days. Since it is a consequential amendment only, arising out of the earlier amendments which have been debated at length and accepted by the committee, I do not propose to go over the arguments again.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I need hardly say that on that basis I have to oppose amendment No. 1 to the amendment. Amendment No. 2 to the amendment seeks to give the tribunal discretion in certain cases to extend the fixed appeal periods provided for in the Act beyond the duration they will be given when this Bill is enacted. Predictably, I do not propose to accept that either as it would have two negative effects. First, it would introduce an element of uncertainty into a process where the fixed periods with no possibility of extension have worked well in practice up to now. Second, the process of considering whether to extend the time for late appeals will be time-consuming and could be an additional burden on the tribunal's capacity to address its caseload.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Furthermore, where there is a procedural discretion of the type which the amendment would bring about there is scope again for judicial review litigation. People would go to the High Court arguing that we should have extended the time and the merits or demerits of a decision not to extend the time rather than deal with the substance of the case. Without in any sense being against judicial review, I do not want to open new grounds of judicial review unnecessarily because our experience in the operation of this system has shown that those who are in the business of delay have an almost infinite capacity to think of new lines of judicial review. Sometimes the judicial reviews are in parallel, sometimes they are in series. One can get tied in knots in the Four Courts.</p>

They delete references which are now redundant following amendment No. 46 to recommendations in manifestly unfounded cases under what will now be the former section 12.

          <p eId="para_168">Error in certain respects of the conduct of the investigation or on arriving at a particular finding on the basis of the facts disclosed in the investigation is not on its own a sufficient basis for overturning the commissioner's recommendation. In other words, this is an appeal effectively by way of rehearing on the merits, it is not an appeal on some technical deficiency at the first instance. The tribunal is required to consider the substance of the issue before it, not whether an error in procedure was made in the RAC. That is effectively what we are providing here. We do not want things to go back on the basis of error when the substance can be decided one way or the other.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">It will not be just that there was a comma missing. One result of this amendment will be to underline the change from the existing manifestly unfounded process where on the basis of an error or technical defect the tribunal had power to overturn the commissioner's recommendation. A recommendation under the present circumstances does not change from being a negative one to a positive one. It is simply a referral back to the commissioner for full investigation. Now that the possibility of remittal on those technical grounds is gone, a mere technical defect in the commissioner's work should not result in the recommendation being overturned where the person is, notwithstanding the error, not in need of protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I oppose the amendment to the amendment because it is essential that hearings should be heard in private. Applicants should be free to tell their story to the tribunal safe in the knowledge that what is said will be kept confidential. It is conducive to a full and open exchange of views which is vital to ensuring the hearing remains useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I believe it was Deputy Costello who said on a previous occasion that some hearings are intimate. I do not believe it would be in the interests of anybody to open up the asylum process to public hearings. Under the Constitution one has to protect the good name of other people, and if the cases were heard in public, allegations that people had abused or tortured applicants would be put into the media. I presume they would have to be on an occasion of privilege, then one would be under "re Haughey" principles, and those impugned by an asylum seeker's story would have the right to redress, cross-examine, rebut or contradict it. I do not want to go down that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">There are some things which even in this politically correct and transparent world are better off done in private. The complexity of doing them in public is that one would have to bring the lawyers in every direction to correct misstatements that adversely affect the reputation of their clients - whether the comments are made under oath is another question. If an asylum applicant impugned a named person in another State and accused him or her of some appalling act of barbarity, I would have to provide some mechanisms to allow that person to rebut it if I was to give him or her any immunity from being sued for publishing the proceedings.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">(11) In this section, "an application for asylum" means a request whereby a person seeks the protection of the State or a convention country or a safe third country by claiming refugee status under the Geneva Convention and includes an application for a declaration under this Act.',".</p>
          <p eId="para_257">This amendment replaces the current section 22 of the Refugee Act 1996, although the new provision restates, unchanged, many of the provisions of the section as it stands in the 1996 Act. Section 22 of the Act is the section that sets out the power to make orders to implement the Dublin Convention. That is the Convention that has as its principle, broadly speaking, that an application for asylum in an EU member state should be examined in whichever of the member states the applicant first arrived.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The amendment is primarily designed to extend that order-making power so that the Minister will also be able to give effect under this section to a number of other related instruments and to any future agreements with similar features which the State may enter into. One related instrument, at subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), is the parallel agreement, based on the Dublin Convention, between the EU and Norway and Iceland that in effect extends the operation of the Dublin Convention to those two countries which are not EU member states but have managed to become party to Schengen.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The other instrument, referred to at subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), is Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003, known colloquially, and I think charmingly, as the Dublin Regulation or Dublin 2 - just as well it is not Dublin 4. This regulation comes into effect on 1 September 2003 and will supersede the Dublin Convention. As a Council regulation it is of course of direct effect in Irish law and any secondary legislation necessary for it to have full effect can be made under the European Communities Act 1972, but in light of the special features of the regulation and its similarity to its predecessor, the Dublin Convention, I consider it desirable that there be power to implement it by order under this section, to preserve continuity with its predecessor. Otherwise I would have to use the European Communities Act and make statutory instruments under that.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The final possibility catered for by the new subsection (1) is that Ireland may enter into agreements with other designated safe third countries which would have features similar to the Dublin Convention for the transfer of applications, and their applicants, between the two countries. Subsection (5) spells out the detail of the criteria for designating a country as a safe third country, and Deputies will no doubt note the similarity between these criteria and those for safe countries of origin spelt out in the new section 12 of the 1996 Act which the committee approved in an earlier amendment. The important addition is that the third country cannot be designated unless both it and Ireland have entered into an agreement whereby the two countries agree to accept back asylum seekers who have arrived from the other country. The effect of this is that although there are many countries throughout the world which would be safe places for a person to make an asylum claim and have it dealt with properly, Ireland will not send an asylum seeker back to such a country unless we have proper arrangements to ensure that the person will be accepted back. This is a sensible provision, if for no better reason than that sending people back without such an arrangement in place would result in them being returned straight away to this country, but it also safeguards the rights of people returned in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">All these instruments and potential instruments exemplify what is known as the "first safe country" principle, whereby those who are fleeing from persecution in their own countries are expected to seek protection in the first country that can offer a safe haven. Both nationally and internationally, legal academic commentators on human rights and refugee law acknowledge that the right to seek asylum does not imply a right to seek it where one pleases. It follows that the right is satisfied if the individual in need of protection has the opportunity to obtain protection wherever the individual finds himself or herself, but it is a matter for the individual to seek to avail of that opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Provisions on safe third countries are an essential feature of any asylum system. They bring an element of order and rationality internationally to the question of providing protection to those who need it; they pose no threat to the genuine refugee and they act to reduce the prevalence of multiple asylum claims and related abuses of national asylum systems.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">This is the final part of the Minister's structures, the paraphernalia that he is establishing to fast-track the application process. People are being moved to safe countries that are now designated and the procedures for doing that are being put in place. I ask the Minister about one or two points regarding cases where an appeal is made after a removal. What is the status of an appeal at that stage? If one is already deported to a safe country and can appeal from its safety and comfort, one is very unlikely to make a successful appeal. How is that expected to operate? In the case of a person under the current rules being locked up for 48 hours to have his or her credentials checked before being put back on the boat, how does the Minister expect that to operate?</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_264">I may have been cutting back on the explanations. I do not want to leave the record as bare as I perhaps might have done had I just stopped there. The differences between the present section 22 and the proposal in this amendment are set out in some detail in the explanatory material which my officials have supplied, in particular in the consolidated text of the Refugee Act and in the footnotes to the appendix. Most of those differences are merely technical changes to allow for the additional instruments to be implemented under the section and I do not propose to go into them now. I will concentrate on the more important innovations in the new section.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The first new feature is at subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), in combination with subsection (4)(<i>a</i>). That provides that the decision at first instance whether to send back an asylum application may be taken by the Minister, the Refugee Applications Commissioner or an immigration officer, as may be specified in an order under the section. Under the Act as originally passed in 1996, those decisions were taken by an authorised officer of the Minister. They are currently dealt with by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. This proposed change will cater for the possibility that for applications made at a point of entry into the State, the first instance transfer decision could be made by, say, an immigration officer, while for applications made inland the responsibility could be left with the Commissioner or taken on by staff of the Minister’s Department, as before. This offers more flexibility in devising procedures to deal with different streams of applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The new subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) provides for the possibility of an appeal against the transfer of an application being what is termed non-suspensive, in other words, that a decision to transfer an application to a convention country or a safe third country can have immediate effect even in cases where an appeal has been made, on the basis that sending the person there will not put the person at risk of persecution and the country will be processing the person’s claim for asylum, in the case of convention countries, or consistent with analogous terms of any future agreement that might be negotiated with a safe third country.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Where an order provides such non-suspensive effect for appeals, it will be without prejudice to the outcome of an appeal in any particular case. Thus, where an appeal resulted in a determination that the application should be processed in Ireland, the application, and of course the applicant, would be taken back into the State for that purpose. For example, in the case of a safe third country, if someone were to come from Switzerland to Ireland, or from Canada to Ireland, and we had an agreement of this kind with those countries so that we could send people back——</p>

          <p eId="para_269">No, we are talking of a safe third country agreement. It is analogous to the Dublin Convention but it is not the same thing. It might for instance be possible for Ireland and the United Kingdom to negotiate such an agreement, or for Ireland and Switzerland, or Ireland and Canada. If a person presents at Dublin Airport, having arrived from one of those countries, and we had an agreement with that country, we could tell the person that he or she must return there. If the person wants to appeal that decision, he or she can be told to make the appeal from there.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_271">Yes, and we will then allow him or her in. The safe third country idea is that if one does not have some system of non-suspensive appeal, someone can gatecrash Ireland and say "I am coming in and you can make a first decision against me, but I will appeal it, and will stay here while it is appealed." If that is the case, someone is effectively putting the boot to the door of Ireland without regard for the merits of the first decision, getting a toe in the door by means of an appeal, and staying in Ireland. We want a system under which countries with which we are cheek by jowl come to an agreement with us that we will do the same for them in order that, if someone steps off an aeroplane from Dublin in Toronto, Canada, and the authorities wish to send him or her back, he or she can appeal to get into Canada in his or her own good time but he or she will not be allowed to remain during the appeal. The alternative is to provide for extensive detention of appellants. If one does not detain them, one leaves them on the loose in Ireland while their appeals are pending, in which case one is effectively admitting that one cannot control abuse of the system. This will also apply within the European Union. Under the Dublin Convention, we are not obliged to have an appeals system in place. Therefore, this represents something extra being granted.</p>

If that was the case, there would be reciprocal arrangements between the two countries concerned in each case. We would reciprocate with other non-nationals arriving. What would the criteria be for sending someone to one country rather than another?</p>

          <p eId="para_277">If we had an agreement with Switzerland, it would be bilateral. We would both agree to take people back who had been rejected by the other under this system. We would also both agree that if someone arrived in Dublin on an aeroplane from Zürich, we would be able to invoke the agreement, detain him or her for a short period, find out who he or she was and, in certain circumstances, send him or her back to Switzerland, saying any point should be made to the Swiss. If someone from Dublin arrived in Zürich, the authorities could, having identified him or her, detained him or her briefly and worked out that he or she wished to apply the agreement to the case, send him or her back to where he or she came from. We trust the Swiss enough to know that they would not do anything barbaric to anyone in those circumstances, and they trust us.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">This is effectively a bilateral agreement with third countries. It does not apply to countries about which the asylum seeker alleges persecution. It is a safe haven. If a person claimed that the Swiss Government was trying to kill him or her, the Irish Government would not invoke the agreement to send him or her back. The agreement's great merit will be that it will prevent totally brazen applicants kicking the door in on us. Having passed through a totally safe country, they appear in Ireland wishing to be treated as an asylum seeker, despite having no reason or excuse for not having made the application in the first country.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_279">Perhaps I might make a final point. In such cases where someone was coming from Switzerland to Ireland, would he or she not have been likely to have made an initial application in the first European country, if he or she was from outside western Europe? The Minister described it as asylum-seeking shopping. In most circumstances which he envisages would this not come under the Dublin Convention?</p>

          <p eId="para_280">That is possible but the agreement supplements the Dublin Convention. The purpose of the detention would be to find out who the person was and whether he or she had applied somewhere else. The idea is to create another possibility for underlining the "first safe country" principle. Despite all the laws and duties under the 1951 convention, we have a bilateral arrangement with another country bound by it which we will trust enough to send a person back, refusing leave to remain in Ireland while he or she argues the toss with us.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">I was going to finish. I am not saying we should open the doors but there are places to which people travel from Africa, for example, France or Belgium. As I said, some of these countries have former or current imperial interests, for example, in supporting an existing Government. People fleeing persecution by that Government might not want, when they land in France, to apply for asylum in the belief that France is supporting the Government. Instead, the refugees might seek another country in Europe which they believe would be more likely to accord a sympathetic hearing. That is the point I am making. I am not saying a person should not apply for asylum in the first country but there are incidents, especially regarding Africa, where people will not want to apply in the first port in which they land but instead try to get out as quickly as possible. In what is proposed is there a facility to allow such people to arrivehere?</p>

The former imperial powers, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh refers to them, are our partners in the European Union. I am not in a position to start cherry-picking among them.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The Deputy is suggesting that somebody from Francophone Africa - the former French controlled regions of Africa - might have a particular reason for not wishing to go to France. One of the curious aspects of asylum flows is that the number who come to Ireland from Francophone Africa is tiny, whereas the number who come here from Anglophone Africa is huge. There could be theoretical cases such as the Deputy mentioned but the huge preponderance of asylum seekers go where they can speak the local language. Afghans go to England, rather than France. People from Mali, Mauritania and Chad go to France, Belgium or Luxembourg where they can speak the language, rather than Ireland.</p>

There is no need for the applicant to be present in the State while the appeal is being decided. If it is successful, the applicant will be brought back and the merits of the asylum claim investigated and decided by the independent bodies in accordance with the Refugee Act.

          <p eId="para_333">This amendment relates to the appeals tribunal. I am seeking to insert a section outlining how the chairman should assign work to the members of the tribunal. We need to ensure there is a strong level of transparency in the operation of the appeals mechanism. Earlier we discussed the public nature of the appeals process. I believe only 7% of applications were granted on the first occasion while up to 21% were successful in the appeals mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Each member of the tribunal is paid on a per case basis. On the surface, there appears to be a discrepancy between who gets cases and who does not. It is possible to calculate the number of cases somebody gets from the payment received. A few get no payment, which means they get no cases to process. I want to ensure the work will be assigned by the chairman equitably, without regard to the proportion of appeals. There should be statistics and information on the number of appeals assigned to each member. This should be public knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The number of appeals allowed and rejected should be made known. While I am not alleging anything, it could be that some members are refusing appeals all the time. Equally, other members might be allowing them all the time. None of us knows what is happening. One individual processes the appeal. We need to tighten public accountability and ensure transparency. Even if the Minister does not want to do this by way of my amendment, we need a structure in order that we can be satisfied the process is operating in a fair and equitable fashion.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_336">When the Deputy raised this issue in the Dáil, I suggested that he table an amendment, as this would be a better forum to discuss the issue. Some material was recently published about earnings etc. The Deputy referred to two individuals who had received no money, from which he deduced they had no caseload. Having been appointed to this position, for personal reasons one of them is not in a position to accept work. This has nothing to do with a choice made by anybody else. The second person who got no money has only recently been appointed and is being trained. Any inference that two people are being starved of work is not correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">All members contract to carry out a certain caseload per annum. In general, the problem is not one of members being given too little work. On the contrary, problems have arisen because they are not reaching the minimum threshold they undertook to reach for us because of their other commitments. The chairman of the tribunal has indicated to me that if he has a problem, it is not that he does not want to give out work but that some members are not in the position to do it, even to the extent that they contracted to do it. I need to give consideration to this. In some cases the chairman reduced members' caseloads because of their commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Most members of the tribunal come up for reappointment in November and I will ask the chairman to determine if he needs more. It is a matter of indifference to the Exchequer whether individuals earn much or little. I will ask the chairman to inform me whether the maximum number, currently 32, is adequate for his purposes and whether he is happy with the way the system is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I accept, as the Deputy is suggesting, that some members of the tribunal are more towards one end of the spectrum than the other in their decisions. Undoubtedly, that is so but I do not intend to have a form sheet published in order that people will say: " A good one to bring your case to is Mr. So and So or Miss So and So. He or she is a 24% person whereas the other is a 3% person." We do not do this with the Judiciary; nobody goes around saying how many times District Judge So and So has disbelieved the Garda. Perhaps some rely on gossip to form an opinion but we do not produce league tables for judges. If there was something egregiously wrong, I would expect the chairman to do something about the matter because he is a very eminent lawyer who has much experience. If he thought from the figures that somebody was acting in a prejudiced way, I think he would draw this fact to the person's attention. I do not intend to go down the road of publishing league tables or say to the public at large that Mr. McDowell, as a member of the tribunal, is a soft touch or as hard as nails by reference to a published league table. That would be a disastrous way to do business.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">While the chairman was appointed following completion of the normal Civil Service recruitment process, the members were appointed by the Minister's predecessor. I presume the Minister will make the appointments in November. He has already indicated that at least one person was not in a position to take any cases and, therefore, could not be assigned any. Obviously, the discrepancy in the range of earnings from zero to €319,000 for the top earner indicates a degree of availability. Presumably, the caseload assigned was related to availability to process cases. In 2002 there were approximately 5,000 cases assigned to be dealt with by the appeals tribunal - a substantial amount of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">There should be a normal recruitment process whereby the Civil Service and Local Government Appointments Commissioners would interview people in the same way as the chairman was interviewed. The degree of availability to do the work should be an integral part of the process. It seems that this needs to be put on a better footing. The Minister says there is more work to be done than members can do. He also raised the question of availability. It seems the tribunal is a little amateurish and its methods ad hoc. Does the chairman come in and say: "I will contact Mr. X or Ms Y to ask him or her whether he or she has a case running in the courts and if he or she has, too bad, we cannot process an application through the appeals process," or does he say, "I will try to get somebody else?" To my mind, this does not seem to be a very satisfactory way of dealing with the matter. I ask the Minister to review the process in November to see whether it is adequate to deal with the workload or needs to be put on a better footing.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">Approximately 40% of the tribunal members will come up for reappointment in November, it is by no means all. These are fee per item positions which are not pensionable. Members of the tribunal are not civil servants, unlike the chairman who is a full-time officeholder subject to the Civil Service Acts. Members of the tribunal are paid on on a per case, per file basis. I would be very slow to start paying daily, weekly or monthly remuneration because at least the system has the advantage that the harder one works, the more one earns. Obviously, we cannot run the whole country on this basis because under the Constitution our judges have to be paid salaries and cannot be dealt with on a per case basis. In this case I would be very reluctant to walk away from the principle that the remuneration of tribunal members should reflect what they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">It is primarily a matter for the chairman to organise the business of the tribunal and manage its caseload. I will be in consultation with him in relation to these matters. It should be noted that he may from time to time convene a meeting with a member or members to discuss matters relating to discharge of the business of the tribunal, including, in particular, such matters as the avoidance of undue divergence by members in the exercise of their functions under section 16. He has a statutory mandate to do this. That said, they are independent in carrying out their functions and the chairman is not there to ask them to decide more cases in favour of the State or the applicant. That is not their function.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_344">The Minister has said the harder a person works the more he or she will earn. That should not be the basis for the work of a tribunal. Cases should be distributed equitably among its members. Some may work harder and be given more cases. If members are appointed by the Minister, they should be appointed on their merits to do a good job, not just for some of their number to work hard and earn more and for others not to be available. There is a substantial flaw at the heart of the manner in which the caseload of the tribunal is organised. It is not equitable.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">I do not wish to adopt an ideological approach one way or the other. It is for the chairman to do this and he is entitled and duty bound to allocate the work in a proper and effective way in order that the tribunal works efficiently. If there was absolute equality and strict rotation, regardless of the capacity of a person to do the work and their availability, bearing in mind his or her other professional, social or family obligations, there would be a situation where a backlog would quickly pile up for some who were under more pressure than others. As a result, the process would become slower.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">What I do not want to do is give work to members who are unwilling to do it and would regard it as an imposition. As I understand the system, every member of the 32 person panel is entitled to work as much as he or she wants. I do not want a situation to arise where some of them will say they are quite prepared to process another case and others: "Oh no, not another case, I do not have the time to do it." That would not be a good way to run the tribunal.</p>

When a person is being appointed or recruited to a job, he or she should know whether he or she will be available to carry out his or her work. If the 32 members do not have a similar workload and a similar rate of work, an individual may be dealing with 20% or 30% of cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">7.-(1) Notwithstanding any provision of any other enactment but subject to section 11(4) of the Refugee Act 1996 ('the Act of 1996'), whenever so requested, an information holder shall give to another information holder such information, including personal information, in his or her possession, control or procurement regarding non-nationals, including applicants within the meaning of the Act of 1996 for the purposes of that Act or for the purposes of the administration of the law relating to the entry into and the removal from the State of non-nationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">(2) The Minister for Social and Family Affairs may, for the purposes of the Social Welfare Acts, request an information holder to furnish him or her with such information including, personal information, in his or her possession, control or procurement regarding non-nationals, including applicants within the meaning of the Act of 1996 and the information holder shall comply with any such request.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">(3) Following the receipt of a request under subsection (1) or (2), the Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs may withhold any information in his or her possession or control in the interests of national security or public policy ('<i>ordre public</i>’).</p>
          <p eId="para_398">(4) In this section 'an information holder' means a Minister of the Government, a local authority (for the purposes of the Local Government Act 2001) a health board, the Garda Síochána or any other body established-</p>
          <p eId="para_399">(<i>a</i>) by or under any enactment (other than the Companies Acts 1963 to 2001), or</p>

          <p eId="para_402">I do not want to waste the committee's time. This amendment is intended to put on a statutory basis the obligation of public bodies to share information for the purposes of the Refugee Acts. In the absence of a statutory basis, there is a doubt in some circles about whether the powers of the Data Protection Commissioner apply to the exchange of information. The Government's view is that this material should be fully exchanged. We do not live in separate and isolated compartments. It is perfectly reasonable for the Department of Social and Family Affairs to inform the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and vice versa, under these provisions. I will do some tidying up on Report Stage to ensure information in the hands of the Garda or otherwise will not be released if such a release would prejudice the detection or prosecution of offences.</p>

The Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order 2000 sets out a procedure, including appeal to an independent body - the Refugee Appeals Tribunal - for determining whether an applicant should be transferred to another safe country where it is proper that the claim should be examined. Once that is over, the Minister can make a deportation order to give effect to the transfer. It appears, however, that this is not protracted enough for the Deputy who wants a further process. The whole purpose of the Dublin Convention is to get on with moving people to the correct country. I do not believe there is any need for this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">This section has caused much controversy. It seeks to move jurisdiction for dealing with certain cases from the Equality Authority to the District Court. The Minister has explained the rationale behind the decision but neither I nor the many groups which have worked in this field and lobbied us are happy with it. We do not consider this to be a positive move.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The Minister said it would be better if jurisdiction for dealing with all matters relating to intoxication and licensees was held in the one court. However, this is not true in other areas of law where jurisdiction is shared. For example, employment law provides for two or three jurisdictions such as the Labour Court, the Equality Authority and recourse to the District Court in some matters. Jurisdiction was given to the Equality Authority in the first instance to ensure there would be an independent body with expertise to adjudicate, although I do not suggest that the District Court would not have similar expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The system in place allows for mediation, for which the courts do not usually allow. It also allows for it to be done at relatively low cost for both parties by comparison with the costs they may incur if they must have recourse to the District Court. The current system works reasonably well and it would be a retrograde step to move away from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">While there is a perception among some that the Equality Tribunal would be an easy touch for one group or another, an examination of the awards granted shows that in most cases they have not reached the maximum allowable while they have been very low in others. The tribunal has also issued judgments against those who have claimed discrimination of one kind or another. In view of this, it would be regrettable if there was a move away from an expert group such as the tribunal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_222">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_460">I oppose this section and agree with some of the arguments made in opposition to it. The Minister is creating a puff of smoke by giving the impression that a substantial structure of precautionary provisions will be put in place to protect those who will be affected by an extension of the reach of the District Court. It is proposed that the court will cover areas currently covered by the Equality Tribunal. The tribunal is disappointed at the manner in which elements of its work are to be transferred to the District Court and unhappy with the statements made by some, particularly in the publican lobby, that it was unprofessional in its approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">It is proposed to transfer from the Equality Tribunal to the District Court key areas of discrimination, especially those dealing with access to public houses. This is being done for the reasons outlined by the publicans. This is of relevance to other groups because once this is established, there is a danger that other service providers will seek to obtain the same exemption from the provisions of the Equal Status Act. It is dangerous to go down this road.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The Minister has argued that compensation will be provided and that tough measures will be enacted, including the provision for temporary closure, which is as strong as it gets. He also argues that the Equality Authority can support an application, that assistance can be provided and that objections can be made to the renewal of a licence. That is part of the guilty complex approach to the section. The Minister well knows he has pulled the rug from under the feet of so many in terms of their right of access to the Equality Tribunal. If the heart of what should be provided is to be removed, it does not matter if a good surrounding structure is imposed on the replacement. It will not undo the damage that will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">According to the recent report by the Equality Tribunal, the number of racist complaints has tripled in the past year while in most areas, there is an increase in the number of complaints, even though there has been a decrease in the number made by the Traveller community, which is welcome. Nevertheless, there are major areas of discrimination and it is a contradiction in terms to talk of dealing with these in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. The Minister is saying he will impose discriminatory procedures that will be non-discriminatory in effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I am disappointed at the inclusion of this section. The country must face up to the whole area of discrimination but the District Court is not the relevant arena in which to deal with it. The equal status legislation was enacted for this purpose, as is the Office of the Director of Equality Investigation and the Equality Authority. The Minister has said the applicant states to the European Union are beginning to look to Ireland as a template for their equal status legislation, yet the Bill seeks to derogate from it and in doing so will create a precedent for other service providers to follow. They will argue that if the drinks industry can insist that cases against it should be dealt with in the District Court, they should have the same facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">There is a final issue lacking in the District Court. If a case comes before the District Court and it makes a determination, there is no report on it such as the report from the ODEI published today. If each case dealt with involved the production of a report, one would have that in the public arena and one could see exactly where the alleged discrimination took place, how it was dealt with and what was the outcome. That information will not be available to us if these cases end up in the District Court.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_223">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_466">It is difficult to believe that Deputy Costello referred to this section as a puff of smoke. There has been outrageous overt abuse of the existing system. Publicans have continuously found themselves victimised and have been targeted intentionally because of the system which exists already. There is an air of unreality here. The Equality Authority has done itself an injustice by trying to defend the indefensible in this case. The publicans wanted this for a good reason, namely, because they were being victimised by the way the system operates. I cannot believe that people would try to deny that there have been obvious practical difficulties with this. My party would support the provision now included.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I agree with the Deputy that there are major areas of discrimination which still exist in this country, but he loses credibility if he cannot acknowledge that there has been widespread abuse of the present system. I have seen bartenders and publicans goaded and intimidated. The figures speak for themselves. It is badly in need of change and I completely support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_468">Earlier today I launched the report of the Equality Tribunal for 2002. In the course of the remarks I delivered on that occasion I emphasised that the contents of section 19 of this Bill in no sense are intended to reflect on the Equality Tribunal or on its integrity, impartiality or professionalism in the way in which it carries out its functions. I want to reiterate that for this committee and for the benefit of the public who may read this debate in the future. As far as I am concerned, the Equality Tribunal, and its director, Ms Melanie Pine, and staff, do a very good job conscientiously. They have always so done and have upheld the law and behaved impartially in every instance. I want that to be clearly noted because many of the people who say this somehow is diminishing or belittling the Equality Authority, or reflects upon it, are creating a public image that that is so. By saying this damages the Equality Authority or lowers it in the eyes of the community or similar international bodies, many people are creating the very phenomenon which they claim exists, but it does not exist. The Equality Tribunal, as distinct from the Equality Authority, is a tribunal which is established to be impartial and professional, and has always been so. It has always applied the law as it saw it. I have no criticism to offer of the way in which it has carried out its functions and nothing that I am saying or doing in any way implies a criticism of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Deputy Costello inadvertently attributed to the Equality Tribunal a sense of disappointment with this section. The Equality Authority has expressed disappointment and it is free to do so. One of its functions is to comment on equality legislation. It is an independent body and is free to criticise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and/or the Government if it feels that is appropriate. However, the Equality Tribunal has never criticised this measure and the director of the tribunal clearly indicated today that she took the law as she found it, and that is my strong view of how it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I want to emphasise this point. In the case of a single transaction such as, to take an example which is not Traveller related, that of a member of the gay or lesbian community who is standing inebriated at the door of a licensed premises, if the licensee decides, on balance, to allow that person to enter the premises, then the licensee must have the following issue in the back of his or her mind, "Am I committing an offence under this new Bill? Am I allowing a person who is drunk onto my premises?" The licensee must decide if this person is just merry or if he or she is drunk, boisterous or whatever. If the licensee conspicuously does allow the drunk person onto the premises, he or she, if convicted, stands to have the premises closed by the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Looking at exactly the same person demanding exactly the same admission, at present under the law another little bulb is flashing in the publican's head asking the following questions, "If I refuse this person admission to my premises, will he or she claim that it is discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, one of the nine prohibited grounds? Will the person bring me before the Equality Tribunal because the person knows I am aware he or she is gay?" This is the kind of issue which confronts people on a daily basis. All I am saying is that if somebody is responsible for making a decision one way or the other on that admission issue of whether the person was or was not drunk, or whether the person should or should not be granted admission, he or she should be answerable in one tribunal only for the decision. If it is criminal liability or if it was in bad faith and the person was merely dressing up an anti-gay policy by relying on an allegation of drunkenness, the person should be responsible to one body only for whatever decision he or she makes in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Broadening the debate away from gay people and including, for example, Travellers, we believe that it would be unfair to say to a publican that he or she can risk the wrath of the local garda sergeant by making an admission in this case and the sergeant may bring him or her to the District Court where his or her licence may be revoked. However, on the other hand he or she should be aware that, for instance, in the case of a Traveller in the same situation as the gay person I mentioned earlier, if he or she gets it wrong he or she will face a claim for compensation in the Equality Tribunal. If one wants a fair and operable law, one has one tribunal which makes decisions of this kind and which brings to bear its experience of the world and common sense to this single issue, and one does not make people amenable for the same decision to two different tribunals. As a Deputy stated in the Dáil in a good analogy, it is as if there was a linesman on the side of the pitch blowing a whistle and saying that a tackle was dangerous and the referee having a whistle in his hand about to make a different decision on exactly the same transaction. One cannot have two referees for the same decision as that is not desirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">If a Traveller, a gay person or a person from an ethnic or religious minority is denied a service anywhere else, there is no District Court dimension to it. If one walks into a book store or a department store on Dawson Street or Grafton Street, the owners do not commit an offence by allowing one to walk in drunk or whatever. Such stores are not liable to be closed because of an admission policy. Only licensed premises will be subject to this strict control of the state of sobriety of patrons and the public order implications involved. The owners of Brown Thomas do not commit a criminal offence if there is disorderly behaviour among its customers. The owners of a theatre that is not licensed would not commit an offence by allowing somebody to be disorderly in the theatre.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">It is only in the context of licensed premises that the District Court has this huge and extensive power to close licensed premises and to remove a person's livelihood because of the way he or she conducts his or her business and whether he or she allows disorder, drunkenness or whatever on his or her premises. It is only in the case of alcohol that we accord to the District Court this huge supervisory power, which entails revocation of licence on the one hand and closure orders, fines and criminal procedures on the other. The District Court decides on hours for extensions and so on in any case. It has full disciplinary control over licensed premises. It is not a precedent that will apply to shop owners, travel agents or any other group of employers who are liable to be brought to book before the Equality Tribunal and they will not be able to point out what happened regarding licensed premises because they cannot say the District Court regulates what happens on their premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I, therefore, do not accept this is a precedent nor do I accept the argument that this is the beginning of a slippery slope. This is an intelligent approach to a problem that has arisen, which is that licensees felt helpless because the same decision exposed them to two alternative sets of sanctions depending on how they made up their minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Deputy Costello stated that temporary closures and revocation of licences are evidence of a guilty conscience and it is window dressing.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">Let us analyse that suggestion. Discrimination on the nine grounds in regard to admission to a licensed premises will be a matter on which the District Court will have teeth, which will be stronger than those the Equality Tribunal had. They will be just as strong in terms of awarding compensation and, in addition, they will have the deterrent effect in that, as part of the process, a premises can be closed on a temporary basis. A member of the media asked me earlier why some publicans refuse Travellers. I replied that if they think they can do that in future, they will not hold on to their licences for very long because under this legislation a publican who says "No Travellers" is giving clear grounds to an interested party to apply to the District Court to revoke his or her licence. Deliberate and conscious discriminatory behaviour is a ground for removing a licence from a publican in its entirety.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">If somebody says "No blacks, no gays, no Travellers" in regard to a licensed premises, he or she faces the loss of his or her pub in its entirety and that is serious.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_483">It has been stated this section was inserted at the behest of publicans but that is not so. Members of the licensed trade are beginning to realise the consequences of this section will be much more serious than anything the Equality Tribunal could have done to them if they engage in discriminatory behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The Equality Authority will be given a strong role under section 19(6) to assist and become involved in the processing of cases where somebody claims he or she has been the subject of discrimination. This new power will enable the authority, where it comes across a pub that is blatantly discriminatory, to assist a person who wants to make a claim for compensation, to bring about a closure of the premises on a temporary basis or oppose the renewal of the licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">This is a balanced measure. We have removed the awarding of compensation from the Equality Tribunal in regard to admission and service issues in pubs but we have not done so on the basis that this is an inducement to publicans to accept the other onerous responsibilities of the legislation. The section contains serious deterrent powers that have never existed in law and they will be effective. We have provided a system for helping people to make these cases under the auspices of the Equality Authority. This strengthens the law and does not weaken it. Above all, it makes the law much fairer.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">It has been argued the authority gives reasons for its decisions but that was anticipated by the draftsman. Section 19(5) states, "An order under this section may, if the Court thinks fit, include a statement of the reasons for its decision and shall, if any of the parties so request, include such a statement." All the reasoning of the District Court judge will have to be stated clearly if he or she awards compensation or does not do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">There is jurisprudence but, generally, a District Court judge is obliged to state reasons that would enable him or her to be judicially reviewed. They cannot say guilty or not guilty in complicated cases. This is the first time that either side in a District Court case will be in a position to require a reasoned judgment in respect of an order made. That is a major step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I emphasise that if I thought for a minute this was a way for the licensed trade to get at the Equality Tribunal or a quid pro quo for the trade, I would not tender a Bill in this form. All those who are worked up about this subject ignore the fact that the Bill introduces heavy penalties for allowing disorder and drunkenness on premises. Any admissions decision in this context should be decided by one tribunal which is aware of publicans' problems and deficiencies. Therefore and despite the fact that a number of organisations have come out against this amendment, I am confident that the majority of the people think a fair balance is being struck and that it is not——</p>

While it's water under the bridge now, I would point out that the Report of the Commission on Liquor Licensing repeated a number of allegations made to it that we did not correctly observe fair procedures, without offering us an opportunity to rebut those allegations. Naturally we fully agree with the Commission that due process is vital - and at all stages we do our utmost to ensure that due process applies and that accessibility, while important, is not at the expense of fairness.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_501">It was also issued to the media. The Minister did not hear the ODEI. That reflects its experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The Minister made a commitment that he would introduce legislation on judicial ethics. The District Court is the court of summary jurisdiction and there has been considerable criticism recently of remarks made by judges of the District Court that were described by the people affected, by others and by organisations representing different groups as quite racist in tenor and tone. Some of the judges have apologised for the remarks they made. I do not wish to cast aspersions on the District Court system but, if cases of discrimination are to be transferred to the court, the issue of judicial ethics must be paramount. Will the Minister indicate when he will produce the judicial ethics legislation or guidelines?</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The District Court will deal with some issues of discrimination, namely, those defined in the Bill, but not with others. The Minister states that responsibility for judgment on cases concerning admission to public houses is being transferred to the District Court because it deals with all matters relating to intoxicating liquor. The Equality Tribunal, however, deals with some areas of discrimination, and now so too will the District Court. Two bodies will deal with elements of the same issue. This is an anomaly although, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh pointed out, certain bodies already deal with two areas and it is not unknown in the jurisprudence area. For example, the Labour Court and the normal courts deal with unfair dismissal issues, and these are dealt with at the same time in two different forums. It is not unknown for this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The Minister is creating a situation where the District Court will be expected to deal exclusively with this issue. It is unlikely in practice that the massive tower of protections the Minister has constructed will come into play. He will have already created a new forum which will deal with the issue and that will be the beginning and end of it. It is a shame because we are coming to grips with equality issues. It has been a huge difficulty for the country to do this because we were isolated for so long. We are trying to deal with equality issues and the Equality Tribunal is the best forum for doing that. It should be the forum for all equality issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The Minister wants to give responsibility for dealing with issues relating to intoxicating liquor to the District Court, but it only operates in the area of licensing and, even then, is not the only body to operate in this area. The Revenue Commissioners provide certificates. Licences for the sale of alcohol are provided without the need to involve the District Court. The Minister has not felt the need to consolidate these areas within the remit of the court. He has also created a new area where the District Court is not involved in the granting of ministerial licences to sporting bodies. A false justification is being created that, because the District Court deals with issues of liquor licensing, it will be given responsibility for dealing with the issue of discrimination in this area as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">There is no basis for the link the Minister makes and I reject it. In his own words, it is window dressing for something that has been a major concern for the publican lobby. It wanted these cases removed from the remit of the ODEI and placed under the jurisdiction of the District Court. I know that because I was lobbied, as were all Members. Publicans have been lobbying on this issue for a long time and they made their submission to the Commission on Liquor Licensing. The Minister accepted it but added his protections. These will be of little value because the horse has bolted and the issue has already been moved to another forum where they will not make much difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The pity is that this point can be lost in the argument in which Deputy Deasy, among others, got caught up, that this is a straight conflict between publicans and the Traveller community. It is not; it is a question of discrimination in all its forms and of excess, and that should be dealt with in a proper forum. If we make it a showdown between the publicans and the Traveller community, we will exacerbate the situation. If the Traveller community believes the section has been cobbled together for the purpose of penalising it in some fashion, the end result will be greater antipathy in existing relations. Terrible activities have taken place in public houses that could not possibly be condoned. The situation will probably degenerate because of Travellers' belief that they are now being discriminated against in law and publicans are behind the introduction of the legislation which effectively targets Travellers.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The mediation service, which is provided by the ODEI and is becoming a major part of its function, is the ideal forum for dealing with this unacceptable activity which is taking place in some rural areas rather than transferring it to a forum where there is a perception that a fair hearing will not be given.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I listened with interest to the Minister's story about referees and the number of people involved in the debate on the District Court and the Equality Tribunal. From my experience of attending football matches in Croke Park, I constantly see the referee consulting linesmen or umpires on the pitch and likewise in Tolka Park. The umpires are constantly consulted by the referee so that he can make a properly informed decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Regarding the debate on section 19, did the Minister, who has a very good legal mind, ever consult a person who was discriminated against? Did he ever try to understand the hurt these people feel, whether they be Travellers, black people or those with a disability? I have a great deal of personal experience in this regard, especially concerning people with disabilities. Sometimes people involved in the legal profession and justice issues should become involved in the nitty gritty of discrimination because it is a serious issue which requires a serious response. I welcome the Minister's comments about the District Court having teeth. However, why do Travellers and disability groups express concern about the District Court?</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Regarding anti-social behaviour, I have frequented a pub for 20 years where Travellers were served and it was never an issue. If anyone caused trouble they were barred and there was no second chance. That was the reality and everyone obeyed the rules. I also know many pubs where the same Travellers will not be served.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I had the experience of trying to organise a residents' meeting one night in a hotel on the Malahide Road. When it was discovered that I was meeting a group of Travellers and residents, the booking was cancelled. I experienced walking up to the door of the hotel with Christine Ward, Ann Joyce's sister, who is very involved in Travellers' rights, and being told she was not allowed in because she was a Traveller. I presume that day has gone, but I will never forget the hurt in her eyes and the humiliation at the door. I was allowed into the hotel and she was not because she was a Traveller. However, I accept we have moved on from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">I do not want discrimination to be linked with anti-social behaviour. If a Traveller or settled person misbehaves, the law should apply equally. My problem is that, if there is a row in a pub in Dublin among a group of settled people it will not even make the news. However, if there is a row among a group of Travellers, it will be reported in the media, including RTE, and in the Dáil and Seanad. The Mayo incident was all over the national media. I address this question not just to us as legislators but also to our friends in the media - where is their respect for equality?</p>
          <p eId="para_514">We need specialist people involved in the equality issue. I have tremendous regard for people like Niall Crowley from the Equality Authority. They have made a major contribution to society by bringing people along and tackling discrimination and they must be listened to. Sometimes the views expressed may be minority ones but, when one is dealing with injustice, inequality and discrimination, one must bite the bullet and be tough. I have concerns about section 19 and the District Court in the context of equality. The Equality Tribunal is the best forum in which to deal with discrimination.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_515">It is a pity that Deputy Deasy has left because I was going to address the latest tribunal report. The reports for the first two years give the lie to the point he made. There were 45 successful recommendations and the highest award to a licensed premises was in excess of €3,000. One case involving Travellers was higher than the family status claim at €2,539. The average award by the tribunal during that period was €1,144. It gives the lie to Deputy Deasy's point that the licensed trade is being fleeced or is under threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">One of the advantages of the Equality Tribunal is that there was mediation. I have been involved in two cases. People who claimed they were discriminated against came to me and asked if I would write a letter seeking mediation on their behalf. The process in the District Court is different. Mediation means there is less cost involved because one does not have to employ barristers, solicitors and so on. The Minister said that the Equality Authority will have the ability to assist in cases coming before the District Court. The problem is that there is no reference to additional funding for the Equality Authority to allow it to carry on the task. If the Minister is going down that road, perhaps we will be able to accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I can understand where a large number of non-governmental organisations are coming from, including Amnesty International, Age Action Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the National Women's Council. Are we saying that all these organisations are wrong and that the Minister is the only one who is right? I do not think so.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_519">The tribunal, which has been in place for three years, is just getting to grips with this issue and suddenly it is ended. All the expertise available in recent years has been to no avail. The issues are being dealt with in the District Court which, as I said on Second Stage, is already over-stretched. The courts system in Ireland is already dealing with too many issues. We must try to facilitate the speeding up of the District Court system. We should not over-burden it with additional tasks, including that of making decisions on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The other problem is that, while the Bill was introduced to curb the excessive consumption of alcohol and enhance public order, we are now discussing the issue of discrimination. There is an example in one of the submissions and it would be interesting to hear how the Minister responds to it. If people are discriminated against by a restaurant they can go to the Equality Tribunal but if the restaurant has a licence to sell intoxicating liquor they will have to go to the District Court. The logic defies me.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The other problem with the shift is that while the Equality Tribunal has an investigative role, the District Court does not. Complainants, or those complained against, will not be able to avail of the legal advice of equality officers or mediation facilities. The Equality Tribunal system is simple, understandable and less formal and is accessible to most people. There is also a degree of uniformity among equality officers. There is not the same variance as among judges of the District Court, where while one judge will impose a heavy sentence while another will impose a light one. For this reason, I urge the Minister to leave well enough alone and let the matter rest with the experts. If need be, when he codifies everything in a year or two or three, it could be looked at again. However, I do not think we should toy with a system which guarantees rights and has been effective up to now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_248" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_522">Everyone seems to forget that under the Equal Status Act the District Court is given an important role. We know that the Equality Authority has recently decided to apply to the District Court for a declaration that Portmarnock Golf Club is a discriminating club. From where, therefore, does the argument about expertise suddenly arise and why is it considered that the District Court is inadequate to decide equality issues? While I believe there are High Court proceedings which may affect whether the Portmarnock case is brought, if it proceeds it will be before a District Court judge and he will have to decide any such application with regard to section 8. I remind Members that in regard to discriminating clubs it states:</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Any person, including the Authority, . . . may, on application to the District Court (in this section referred to as "the Court"), request that the Court make a determination as to whether a club is a discriminating club.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">It goes on to state:</p>
          <p eId="para_525">After considering the representations, the Court shall-</p>
          <p eId="para_526">(<i>a</i>) make an order in writing setting out its determination as to whether or not the club is a discriminating club, and</p>
          <p eId="para_527">(<i>b</i>) cause a copy of that order to be transmitted to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The suggestion that the District Court is somehow an unsuitable place to decide equality matters is wrong. The court has jurisdiction, under the Equal Status Act, to make a serious determination and to say in relation to a sports club whether it is a discriminating club. The consequence for that club is that it would or could lose its capacity to serve drink if the order is made against it. The District Court is not some court which, under the equal status laws, is a stranger to the whole event and is somehow floating in the nowhere. It is the primary court for determining whether clubs are discriminatory or not.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Deputy Ó Snodaigh made the point that for an unlicensed restaurant the right of redress lies with the Equality Authority whereas for a licensed one it lies with the District Court. My answer to that is "so what?" If someone runs a restaurant which is unlicensed no offence is committed by allowing somebody to be drunk on the premises, or by allowing disorder on the premises in the way provided for in the Bill, nor does the proprietor face revocation of his licence at the end of any year based on whether the food was good or anything like that. The world does not work that way. Licensed premises are special because they are subject to intense control from a number of directions.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I understand Deputy McGrath's point about feeding discrimination and I have no difficulty with it. In such a case, if it happened tomorrow - if a meeting was booked in a particular place and the booking was revoked - one would seek redress through the Equality Tribunal. Likewise, if Travellers book a wedding which is subsequently cancelled by a hotel on the basis that it never knew they were Travellers, it is to the Equality Authority they would go.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Here, we are only concerned with the issue of admission and service in licensed premises. It is important that we focus on that and do not talk about whether a Traveller's wedding was cancelled. For the purpose of this section, discrimination does not include discrimination in the provision of accommodation or of any services or amenities in regard to accommodation, or ceasing to provide accommodation or services or amenities. Anything to do with staying in a hotel, not staying in a hotel, and similar issues are not covered by this. Discrimination in respect of a hotel which says "No Travellers" in regard to going into the hotel to have a meal in the restaurant, or booking a meal in advance or having a party or whatever, is still covered by the Equality Tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked what this provision was doing in the middle of the Bill. It is here because we, for the first time in recent years, are addressing the issue of entry to licensed premises, drunkenness and public order on licensed premises. We are putting in place tough penalties for those who make wrong decisions in regard to admission and service on their licensed premises. We are also putting in place tough remedies against publicans. On conviction of making a wrong decision in regard to service or order issues on their premises they can be closed. As part of this legislative package, a person should not be in a position when making a decision on service or admission of saying, "The District Court will hammer me if I let this man in but some other tribunal will hammer me, if it takes a different view of the transaction, and will say I was discriminatory." All we are doing is removing this dilemma. I do not see a big problem with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The question was raised regarding how the Minister is the only person who stands up for this position and yet there are nine or ten NGOs on the other side. Amnesty International is entitled to its view.</p>

Members of the Dáil who have the authority of a democratic mandate obtained through their membership of an NGO, called a political party, are entitled to have their views considered. No matter how many people sign round robin letters on these issues, I maintain that the average Joe or Josephine Soap, or Seán or Mary Citizen, will agree with me on this issue, not out of prejudice but because it represents a sensible balance.

          <p eId="para_538">A summing up is not necessary - I have just two points. The District Court does not have an investigative role, as such, nor does it have a mediation role. Much of what we have been discussing is best dealt with through mediation. Accordingly, this provision may well aggravate the situation. The court does not have a proper reporting role, although it may provide some report if requested. Also, the cost of proceedings in the District Court is much greater than in the Equality Tribunal. The Bill states that the Equality Authority can provide assistance as it thinks fit. Does that include financial assistance to employ lawyers and, if so, to what extent?</p>

          <p eId="para_542">How far can the Equality Authority go in providing assistance, particularly in financial terms? My final point is in relation to judicial ethics. Highly sensitive matters of discrimination in terms of admission will now be given to the District Court. In Templemore, where we were supposed to visit today, we know the Garda has put in place a race proofing and equality proofing type of training. Has the Judiciary taken any corresponding steps? The Minister referred to legislation on judicial ethics. Will he indicate if he will act in that regard, in parallel to this Bill?</p>

          <p eId="para_544">As matters now stand, the Equality Authority is entitled to give legal assistance to a person to make a claim, before the District Court, that a club is acting in a discriminatory manner. The relevant provision states:</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Where the Authority is satisfied that the case to which the request relates raises a matter of principle, or it appears to it that it is not reasonable to expect the person making the request immediately to present the case before the court without assistance, the Authority may, at any stage, provide such assistance to the person in such form as it thinks fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I have no doubt that involves providing legal aid, effectively in the form of a lawyer or whatever.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">It has a very substantial budget. I do not immediately recollect the precise figure, but it runs to millions of euro. It intended to bring Portmarnock Golf Club before the District Court. While it does not have a limitless budget, it has funds for this purpose and will have to make its own choices as to the extent of its involvement in such cases. The service is currently rendered out of the existing resources, both with regard to recourse to the District Court, as provided for under section 8(3) of the Equal Status Act, and also in assisting people in their dealings with the Equality Tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">With regard to Deputy Costello's question concerning judicial ethics, legislation on this is yet another of my priorities. I am considering draft legislation, on which I wish to consult the Judiciary. I will then bring it to Government in the near future. As the Deputy will appreciate, a number of Bills from my Department have gone through the Houses already this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">The Deputy is suggesting, in effect, that the policy of a licensed premises with regard to children should be stated in a notice on the premises. I understand the reason for this proposal, but the Government considers that it is not such a good idea because a licensed premises may have an inflexible policy. One may decide on the day of a match, for example, that children should or should not be on the premises. One might change's one's policy on a given day. It would be somewhat inflexible to say that decisions in relation to children must be made on the basis of something that was posted on a notice board on the premises. One might decide, making up the rules as one goes along, that one will not allow children to be on the premises on a certain afternoon. This section of the Bill will not allow discriminatory behaviour, but I consider that licensees have to be given the flexibility to decide, on a purely ad hoc basis, that they will not allow children to be present on a portion of the premises.</p>

A policy is not seen as discriminatory if it is decided on in good faith. A decision made in bad faith is not covered by the exemption in the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>

He or she might not object to the presence of children on days when the premises are less crowded. It would be unduly onerous and inflexible to require licensees to display a policy setting out every circumstance in which persons under the age of 18 are or are not allowed on the premises. One might decide that one does not want roaring and shouting children to be present if there is a party of elderly people on the premises, for example. It is better not to regulate this area. If this matter has caused problems, we will deal with it in the Bill that will be brought forward in 2004.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_323">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_633">The wording of my last amendment was adapted from the new subsection 4(<i>a</i>), which is being added by section 25 of this Bill to section 15 of the Equal Status Act 2000. It relates to a notice outlining the policy of a licensee in respect of prohibiting those over the age of 18 from being on the premises. This is a new provision that is being introduced. I specifically used the text of subsections (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) in my amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The Minister is agreeing to allow a policy forbidding a person over the age of 18 years or some other category of person from a premises, provided the policy is displayed in a conspicuous place. In such circumstances, the refusal to sell intoxicating liquor would not constitute discrimination on age grounds, in other words, the method by which one avoids discrimination is by having a policy. In one sense, the Minister is opposing the argument I made on the previous amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">I also object to this provision for a more fundamental reason. The age of 18 years is the cut-off point for adulthood. A person of that age in the Minister's constituency is entitled to elect him to the Dáil to run the country. It is also the general threshold at which adult behaviour begins. As a national Parliament, we should legislate for fundamental matters of this nature, rather than handing over responsibility for determining them to a sectoral group which may decide, even if it prints its policy conspicuously, to discriminate on age grounds. This is, effectively, what the section does.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I recall an occasion when the Minister strongly defended the right of a person to have a pint at the age of 18, be treated properly as an adult and not suffer discrimination. Of all the provisions in the Bill, the decision to give publicans the right to discriminate against people once they have reached the age of 18 is the most difficult one to defend. Children are a different category because public houses are in many ways and at certain times not fit and proper places for them. However, once one has reached the age of 18 it is wrong to introduce discrimination, particularly by handing over discretion on how one will discriminate to individual publicans. It is our job to decide these issues. The House should decide on the age at which one may drink alcohol and its decision should be applied across the State.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_637">I agree with the Deputy, who has covered most of the arguments. When a person reaches 18 years of age he or she is entitled to visit a licensed premises, buy a drink and enjoy it, albeit on condition, once the Bill is enacted, that persons aged 18 to 21 years carry a designated age card. We should not reinstate a provision such as this. When it applied in the past, pubs arbitrarily changed the age at which they would admit patrons. In one pub the age of admittance would be 18 years, while in another it would be 25 years and in some cases doorpersons insisted that one was over 30 years. While the last restriction would not affect many Members now, I remember being refused admittance on occasion despite having reached the legal age of entitlement to be in a pub and enjoy a drink. Part IV should be struck out as it does not add to the legislation in any way.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_325" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_638">I believe, as do a great number of people, that some decisions taken in good faith by many responsible people in the licensed trade should be supported. For example, some off-licensees in good faith pursue what would otherwise be a discriminatory policy in relation to the supply of spirits to young people. We should not penalise them for acting in good faith or adopting a policy which is not socially harmful. To attract the protection of the section they must act in good faith. The market will dictate most of these matters. No publican will be so unrealistic as to refuse to serve persons aged 18, 19 or 20 years as this group has significant disposable income.</p>
